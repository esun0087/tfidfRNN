 im afraid of nothing 
 what you fear is the unknown the people of your planet once believed their world was flat columbus proved it was round they said the sound barrier could never be broken it was broken they said warp speed could not be achieved the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear its an extension of personal fear captain kirk i so much want your understanding i want your respect are you afraid to hear me out 
 you cant expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier 
 i trust your message was received 
 i will take you to the bridge 
 we must change our course at once 
 in order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible we are going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually 
 what are you doing 
 sybok listen to me in order for this craft to enter the landing bay enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam to get us inside and reraise the shields will take 
 no no reply remain on course 
 but i thought captain chekov i see very clever captain spock it would appear that you have been given a second chance to join me what do you say 
 james t kirk captain of the enterprise 
 who are you 
 you staged all this to get your hands on my ship 
 i must have your starship 
 maybe you could wait until im a wee bit stronger i dont think i could take it in my present condition or yours 
 no no no scotty scotty theres so much i want to tell you 
 no sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we have always been afraid to express 
 hes not 
 scotty dear he not a madman 
 uhura i had the strangest dream i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise 
 easy easy easy scotty easy you are back with us 
 starfleet are you aware of our currant status 
 they cant be serious the ships in pieces and we have less than a skeleton aboard 
 i had a feeling you would say something like that so i brought us dinner 
 oh i cannot leave her now when she needs me the most 
 and i thought we were supposed to be going together 
 uhura i thought you were on leave 
 i know you will whip her into shape scotty you always do 
 lets see what shes got said the captain and then we found out didnt we 
 borgus frat 
 no you must save yourselves forgive me brother forgive me 
 sybok we must find a way 
 this is my doing this is my arrogance my vanity 
 sybok 
 i dont understand reveal yourself to me 
 sybok this is not the god of sha ka ree or any other god 
 sybok you are my brother but you do not know me i am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago since that time i have found myself and my place i know who i am and i cannot go with you 
 i dont understand 
 i belong here 
 why not 
 i cannot go with you 
 spock 
 do you 
 i know you better than that 
 i hide no pain 
 each mans pain is unique 
 you know im right 
 no i will not 
 put him in the brig with captain kirk spock you will accompany me to the bridge 
 no you must kill me 
 sybok you must surrender 
 of course of course then i will take the ship without your help 
 i am a starfleet officer 
 im sorry spock i cant surrender now im not through violating neutral zone treaty in fact im just getting started and now for my next violation i intend to steal something something very big 
 it was not my intention to amuse you these are serious charges however if you surrender now 
 spock you have developed a sense of humor after all 
 nahi decidedi have had enough of video games to last me a good long time i feel like gettin into some real life 
 shouldnt you wait till your lawsuits settled 
 oh that is beautiful you have got the goods 
 and dillingers instructions to divert them its all there look even his home phone number when he logged on 
 your old files 
 i know i met him 
 flynn i made it i worked out some new codes for tron put em on a disk and its running 
 uh got any cinnamon 
 want one 
 i was wondering where you got that glow of good health 
 my dinner 
 hi flynn 
 hi alan 
 boy if we were inside i know how to forge us a group N access 
 not if my tron program was running that would seal the system off if your files in there 
 yeah tryin to find the file and erase it once thats gone aint nothin can stop him just eddie and his master control program runnin things from on high 
 dillinger 
 because somewhere in one of those memories is the evidence if i got in far enough i could reconstruct it 
 i still dont get why you are trying to break into the system 
 oh my meanwhile kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and im not seeing one dime 
 senior exec 
 yepper and vice squad and meltdown whole slew of em i was this close to starting my own little enterprise but enter ed dillinger another software engineer not so young not so bright but very very sneaky one night our boy flynn goes to his terminal tries to read up his file and nothing a big blank we now take you to three months later ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has invented the slime didnt even change the names and he gets a big fat promotion thus begins his meteoric rise towhat is he now executive vp 
 you invented space paranoids 
 sherman set the wayback machine foroh N kevin flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at icom hes so bright that he starts going in there at night and sets up a private memory file and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing called space paranoids 
 you havent told him 
 i dont get it 
 embezzling is such an ugly word mister bailey no actually im trying to get a legal brief together 
 are you embezzling 
 tried to cant quite make the connection with that sucker though if i had a direct terminal 
 you did break in 
 im certainly not 
 i dont think im cleared for this 
 uh no i mean not that often 
 flynn 
 what 
 for being on to dillinger 
 for what 
 that dillingers on to him 
 of what 
 to warn him 
 what for 
 i mean i want both of us to go 
 you call that getting over it 
 i want to go to his place 
 okay okay 
 oh i wish youd forget about that it was all so long ago i have totally gotten over it 
 flynn had access to you too im not interested in talking about him 
 flynn had group N access 
 something about tampering some bodys probly trying to siphon the r and d budget into his checking account i dont know why are you so interested 
 did he say why 
 yeahpain in the neck you know i was all set 
 did you say group N access 
 frustrating i had tron almost ready to run and dillinger cut everybody with group N access out of the system 
 hows it going upstairs 
 yes wont that be grand the computers will start thinking and people will stop lora im going to stay and run some data through see you tomorrow 
 they will start to soon enough 
 well you have to expect some static computers are just machines after all they cant think 
 ever since he got that master control program set up systems got more bugs than a bait store 
 yesbut you have to go roundtrip and you must purchase your program at least N days in advance hah 
 great can it send me to hawaii 
 not disintegrating alan digitizing while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object the computer maps out a holographic model of it the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam then the computer reads the model back out the molecules go back into place and voila 
 boy i sit up there grindin away all day and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun 
 hello alan 
 beautiful 
 ok 
 ah sounds good well we should have you running again in a couple of days i hope 
 no it will run independently it can watchdog the mcp as well 
 mmm part of the master control program 
 its called tron its a security program itself actually monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems if it finds anything going on thats not scheduled it shuts it down i sent you a memo on it 
 no no im sure but you understand it should only be a couple of days whats the thing you are working on 
 i hope you dont think its me i dont even balance my checkbook on downtime i have got a honeywell at home for that 
 we have to close that down just briefly security reasons someone with that access has been tampering 
 yeah 
 oh you have group N access dont you 
 well i dont knowi just tried to run this program i have been working on and i was denied access all of a sudden i thought maybe id been laid off and nobody told me 
 oh yes the algorithms on cloud seedinggreat piece of work hows it going 
 alan alan bailey 
 come on in 
 lets get outta here 
 yes 
 so nice ship you got here whats our next move 
 you said it 
 not a chance 
 this towns full o live ones 
 no nuhuh never in a million years 
 this honey doesnt handle so good in town 
 yes okay exactement 
 way to go we are haulin 
 another mouth to feed you dont by any chance know how to drive this crate 
 right on the money 
 im your program 
 no 
 wheres your program wont it miss you 
 for sure 
 only yes and no you are a bit 
 oui da yessiree sure nuff you betcha 
 oh anything else 
 no nyet negatory not on your tintype no way 
 that all you can say 
 yesssss yes yes yes 
 what do you mean yes 
 so do as i tell you keep that tron program out of the system and get me those chinese language program i asked for 
 you wouldnt dare 
 you wouldnt want me to dig up flynns file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times would you 
 if you think 
 the same thing i want with the kremlin im bored with corporations with the information i can access i can run things N to N times better than any human 
 what do you want with the pentagon 
 i have gotten N times smarter since then 
 now wait a minute i wrote you 
 it shouldnt be any harder than general motors was but nowthis is what i get for using humans 
 the pentagon 
 and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week 
 its my fault i programmed you to want so much 
 i cant afford to have an independent program monitoring me do you have any idea how many outside systems i have gone into how many programs i have appropriated 
 im sorry 
 ed i am so very disappointed in you 
 end of line 
 cute 
 theres a N percent chance you are right 
 i think wed better shut off all access till we can find that file just to be safe 
 im afraid so i spotted him this time and kicked him out but hes getting trickier all the time 
 meanwhile he might find it 
 i would if i could find it its stashed somewhere off in the system out of my range meanwhile 
 hes still looking for that old file cant you just appropriate it 
 yes it felt like flynn 
 flynn 
 its our friend the boy detective hes nosing around again 
 no problem masterc if you have seen one consumer electronics show whats up 
 thank you no i have some work to do assuming i can still log on 
 im sorry walt so much pressure lately you feel like going for a drink 
 that was uncalledfor 
 it can be arranged 
 oh i know all that sometimes i wish i was back in that garage 
 doing our business is what computers are for look walter with all respect icom isnt the business you started in your garage anymore 
 user requests are what computers are for 
 the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do i cant sit and worry about every little user request that 
 that mcp you know thats half the problem right 
 walter i sympathize but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy 
 ed all im saying is if our own people cant get access to their programs you know how frustrating it is when you are working on a piece of research 
 they may be derezzed on the carrier hurry 
 dumont wheres yori wheres flynn 
 no tron must destroy mcp first 
 dumont 
 all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible 
 alanone he calls me may i pass 
 who is your user program 
 when you have been in the system as long as i have you hear many promises many reassurancesmany brave plans 
 really youd have programs lined up around the block to use this place and no mcp looking over your shoulder 
 hah 
 dumont my user has information that could could make this a free system again 
 oh you want to hah i could get myself derezzed justfor letting you in here they hate this tower theyd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while and you should hear the way they commune sounds like they were routing a payroll for all the heart they put in it no i dont think you 
 well i want to communicate 
 hmm a difficult proposition difficult proposition at best perhaps you have noticed we are not exactly packing them in these days 
 i have come to communicate with my user 
 yes 
 aah im fine little hung over is all 
 how about you 
 hey you guys ok 
 yes 
 did we make it 
 not with this disk im going to check on the beam connection yori you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs 
 not us i hope 
 probably decided not to pursue us the sea of simulation is tricky lot of illusionsrough navigating programs have a way of just disappearing here 
 what about our friend sark 
 all right thank god alan stayed awake at least 
 we are on our way alanone gave me the coding we need to go up against master 
 stranger and stranger 
 i hate to disappoint you pal most the time thats how it is for users too 
 well thats how it is for programs yes but 
 look you guys know how it is you just keep doin what it looks like you are supposed to even if it seems crazy and you hope to hell your user knows whats goin on 
 then 
 you wish man i havent had a second to think since i got down here i mean in here out here whatever 
 but if you are a user then everything you have done has been part of a plan 
 its time i levelled with you tron im a well im what you guys call a user 
 wrote the 
 no big deal i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine i mean i did write the program for it 
 im sorry tron hes he didnt make it 
 flynn wheres ram 
 yeah i oops 
 you are alive 
 greetings program 
 flynn 
 no goodthey might block off the old chip this way 
 how about over therethat empty memory 
 tankscoming back lets go 
 whats that 
 you know anybody thats got an army for rent thats finebut my uh user said to go take that sucker out an lets face it the big ox isnt gonna get any weaker i feel like hittin him now while im good an mad some nerve what does he care whether you guys get killed long as he keeps rakin in quarters 
 what just the three of us 
 i uh im a program from a user that knows alan 
 the name of my user yeah but how 
 well isnt it 
 where did you hear that name 
 alan 
 shhhhh 
 flynn you cant i 
 probably 
 but wont you be derezzed 
 jump 
 why what are you going to do 
 yori steer us over the beam right next to it 
 lets get some power here 
 flynn we have got to help him 
 almost i just have to adjust our course at the next junction id better go check the instruments 
 elementary physics a beam of energy can always be diverted ooh my head are we there yet mommy 
 how did you do that flynn 
 its too far 
 theres another beam 
 lousy utility companies they are the same wherever you go 
 the mcp blasted it there are very few domains left with any power at all 
 whats wrong with that area 
 a little over there the mountains of data and i think thats the silicon valley 
 boy the view from up here you know the territory 
 guess i took a wrong turn somewhere 
 a user in our world 
 little more juices all it needs 
 hey 
 come here 
 damn never fails minute the warranty runs out 
 are you kidding i think its stealing us 
 we are inside a recognizer you are crazy stealing a recognizer 
 whats goin on 
 alanone 
 feel what you okay 
 it grows on you 
 paramus wonder what those initials stand for probably program assist routine well it sounds like a lovely place 
 wellmy home sector was called paramus 
 the tower yes flynn have you remembered anything else about yourself like what sector you are from 
 its all circuits must be an input or output component 
 recognizers 
 watch it 
 yeah but im remembering all kinds of stuff likemy user wants me to go after the mcp 
 he was disoriented in transport tron 
 tron 
 flynn look tron he survived 
 sure a little disorientation thats normal when they transport you it will come back to you you are doing real well in training remarkable really 
 oh uhi dont remember too much 
 how bout yourself 
 yeah yeah thats great 
 oh i was an actuarial program worked at a big insurance company it really gives you a great feeling helping folks plan for their future needs and of course if you look at the payments as an annuity over the years the cost is really 
 hey ram what were you you know before 
 well great thats no sweat i play video games better than anybody 
 you are aguest of the master control program they are going to make you play video games 
 lookjust so i can tell my friends what this dream was about okay where am i 
 you will be having plenty of chances to get hurt dont worry about that 
 you are getting out of the business 
 hey you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games cheap 
 are you kidding you guys will he running this joint by then 
 well just dont forget your old friends when you are rich and famous 
 you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for 
 as long as we stay off the top floor dillinger will never know we have been in here 
 swelli will log us both on and you can get your tron thing running 
 okay flynn im gonna put you at my terminal down in the laser lab we will be up in alans office 
 not much chance of that now the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it 
 dont even say that you have got to find that file before he does 
 boy i bet i know whos workin late tonight 
 im afraid its a little late for that dillingers shut off group N access he must know what you are up to 
 touche honey yeah i have been doing a little hacking here which i have got every reason as you well know 
 you can see why all his friends are fourteen years old 
 whew you never were much for small talk she still leave her clothes all over the floor 
 have you been sneaking into the icom system 
 sohows the world of serious science 
 good luck you cant even think in here 
 we have to talk 
 hey good to see you guys nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple 
 i dont have time sark and neither do you end of line 
 we will get them sir these things take time 
 yes and now you have got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation 
 now sir we did take care of that user you sent us 
 i hope you have enjoyed being a command program sark i wonder how you will like working in a pocket calculator maybe one of those watches that plays happy birthday to its user once a year 
 end of line 
 yesacknowledge master control 
 then pull yourself together get this clown trained i want him in the games until he dies playing 
 waiti need that 
 you rather take your chances with me want me to slow down your power cycles for you 
 butwhat if i cant 
 now get this straight pal no one user wrote me im worth a couple million of their manyears im bigger than all those little wimps put together humans they cant even keen their social order in one piece 
 well i its just i dont know a user i mean users wrote us a user even wrote you 
 thats right he pushed mein the other world somebody pushes me i push back so i brought him down here whats the matter sark you look nervous 
 a user 
 hes not any kind of program sark hes a user 
 you have got it i have been hopin youd send me somebody with a little moxie what kind of program is he 
 i have got a little challenge for you sark a new recruit hes a tough case but i want him treated in the usual manner train him for the games let him hope for a while and blow him away 
 yes mcp 
 strategic air command 
 sure id love to go up against some of these guys be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me which branch of the service 
 we might be capturing some military programs soon that interest you 
 thank you master control 
 i have to find out what alan wants that comes first 
 do you know what hes talking about 
 we have to 
 you think we can make it there 
 do it 
 what do you think 
 theyd better bei dont want to bust outta this dump an find nothin but a lot of cold circuits waitin for me 
 the usersyou really think they are still there 
 another free program off line whats his user sposed to do 
 new guy 
 wheres flynn 
 its something users do 
 nice 
 i cant theres no junction due for at least N or N nanoseconds 
 we have to get off this beam 
 power surge the transmission beams too strong 
 what is it 
 then i owe you some thanks 
 this is flynn the one who busted me out 
 as long as it gets us out of here 
 yesit can take us across the sea of simulation all the way out of the game gridto the mcp 
 i had toin the games 
 you have grown big program 
 its a flat but wait a micro 
 why is everythinglike this 
 my quarters 
 dont know yet i have to get in touch with alan he was going to tell me how to 
 how 
 thats all going to change yori 
 i cant believe how bad its gotten around here since the mcp started taking over all the good functions have shut down everybody looks so dead im afraid to even go out during downtime 
 oh tron i knew youd escape they have never built circuit that could hold you 
 yori hey 
 will you shutup i should never have told you about him 
 just an hour you should tell this stud to take more time 
 can you cover me for an hour 
 simon ohmygod 
 helen its your mystery man

 she lives in rome but she does stuff here the smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections so she has offices here 
 you are kidding 
 uh huh right here in river city 
 alright i want a complete workup on her do we know where she is 
 and this is a little above market rate for the horizontal bop even for a total biscuit like her 
 this is impressive gentlemen of course it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was 
 probably because it sounds scary 
 why 
 they call him the sand spider 
 sorry sir uh heres what we got 
 so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you 
 yes 
 faisil you are new on harrys team arent you

 they said you had to run out 
 they must have just missed me 
 i was in the area and i thought you might like to have lunch 
 my husband the hero

 well i pull out the manual on their setup which is the new N server 
 whatd you do honey 
 its the big client in japan and its the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed this guys having a meltdown 
 i couldnt believe it i go back to get this report i need right and the phone is ringing so like a bonehead i answer it 
 i will just be a second so what happened tonight at the office

 i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks 
 what did you tell him 
 its not okay its extortion 
 uh huh okay 
 yeah it was wild 
 thats fabulous harry 
 yeah you should have seen it we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system the one for the N how you can write up an order and the second the customers name goes into the computer it starts checking their credit and if they have ordered anything in the past and if they get a discount 
 howd it go at the trade show you make all the other salesmen jealous 
 me too 
 im late 
 okay 
 fine honey stay asleep 
 hi honey how was the flight 
 no soon as i turn you will shoot me 
 beat it 
 wait you got the wrong guy my names simon look just let me go theres no need to kill me i havent seen your 
 you son of a bitch did you really think you could elude us forever carlos 
 yeeaoowww 
 let me think about it hold it a day for me 
 see you and this car were meant for each other why fight it sure i have a couple other buyers lined up but i like your style whattya say should we start on the paperwork 
 hey slow down you are gonna miss the turn 
 sooooo shes pretty good in bed then 
 red hot her thighs steam 
 but with you she gets to be hot right 
 some kinda legal secretary of something married to some boring jerk 
 what does she do 
 i always have a couple on the hook you know theres one right now i have got her panting like a dog its great 
 you working on someone right now 
 those idiots 
 dickless if they took care of business id be out of business know what i mean 
 what about the husbands 
 exactly the trick is you gotta pick your target they have to be nice little housewife types schoolteachers but im telling you you get their pilot lit these babes they can suck start a leafblower 
 use em and lose em 
 doesnt matter i like change you know constant turnover as soon as i close the deal its one of two more times then adios 
 isnt that hard to keep up in the long run 
 well think of it as playing a role its fantasy you have to work on their dreams get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours 
 so you are basically lying your ass off the whole time i couldnt do it 
 okay just ask yourself what do women really want you take these bored housewives married to the same guy for years stuck in a rut they need some release the promise of adventure a hint of danger i create that for them 
 sure set me up and then dont tell me 
 sorry trade secret 
 so whats your angle 
 its killer look at me im not that much to look at no really i can be honest but i got em lining up and not just skanks either some are 
 and you have got one 
 lets face it harry the vette gets em wet but its not enough if you want to really close escrow you gotta have an angle 
 absolutely 
 what are we talking about here pussy right 
 go ahead 
 boris and doris 
 uh well okay then you sound terrible i will run out right now just call the prescription in to the pharmacy sure no problem bye 
 get going 
 what 
 he said he was an american agent 
 of course mrs tasker and what were you going with the international terrorist carlos the jackal taking dictation 
 kettleman barnes and mcgrath im a legal secretary 
 i said sit down who do you work for 
 fuck you 
 like one 
 hold that thought 
 something you obviously have a hard time doing 
 now just keep your knees together and you will be fine 
 samir is just going to ask harry a few questions see we are not even sure which agency harry works for now samir is absolutely first class but on the other hand we have harry here who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for N years so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist 
 whats going on harry 
 no you dont understand we have been married for N years 
 no my dear he is a federal agent he killed two of my colleagues the other night 
 look harrys not part of this hes just a sales rep 
 so now its tasker not renquist 
 im helen tasker harrys my husband and you are 
 whos your little friend 
 i just glances inside 
 you can call me simon you are very brave to do this you opened it 
 helen 
 thank you you saved my life whats your name 
 relax there thats better let yourself slip into the role 
 its just that its been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that i 
 you see what i mean that reaction would give us away in a second try to relax 
 here sit down be comfortable

 helen theres a double agent in my outfit i dont know who theres no one i can trust except you can you get away just for two days

 and you chased one 
 three of them hardly worth talking about two wont bother me again 
 were they trying to kill you 
 its strange i knew i was in a womans thoughts when i was shooting it out with those assassins

 i know but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things 
 you can trust me completely 
 im sorry i cant 
 tell me what happened 
 you recognized my style see you are very good you are a natural at this

 thats what happened in fact when she died it was considered to be the happiest time of her life shed been fucked over so much by men she didnt trust them she was havin this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him now other people had asked to marry her before but she couldnt be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money so she said no and the guy says look i really love you and i wanna prove it so have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens i can never get any of your money and i will sign it so she did and he asked her and she said yes and once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew he was a millionaire 
 you mean she got a bad batch

 that good huh 
 you know i saw it on the stands my first inclination was to buy it but i look at the price and say forget it its just gonna be the same old shit i ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later man i was ever wrong 
 no not yet 
 have you read the story on elvis 
 yeah i subscribe its a pretty decent one 
 actually they can count it id like to use the little boys room 
 wanna count your money 
 i bullshitted him

 we grew up together 
 why does he trust you 
 well elliot wasnt supposed to tell you anythin thanks a lot bigmouth i knew you were a squid the moment i laid eyes on you in my book buddy you are a piece of shit hes not a dirty cop hes a good cop he just saw his chance and he took it

 thank you very much clarence 
 ok sorry lee i just wanna tell you coming home in a body bag is one of my favorite movies after apocalypse now i think its the best vietnam movie ever 
 lee clarence please dont insult me call me lee 
 oh mr donowitz 
 i dont think that will be necessary lets all have a seat boris why dont you be nice and get coffee for everybody 
 well i have to admit walkin through the door and seein these soldier of fortune poster boys made me a bit nervous but lee im fairly confident that you came here to do business not to be a wiseguy so if you want i will put the gun on the table 
 i wanna be able to announce this deal at cannes if i had time for a courtship lee i would id take ya out id hold your hand id kiss you on the cheek at the door but im not in that position i need to know if we are in bed together or not if you want my movie lee you are just gonna have to come to terms with your fear and desire 
 well then whats the hurry is it true the rights to doctor zhivago are in arbitration 
 now thats bullshit lee every time you buy one of those little movies its a risk im not sellin you something thats gonna play two weeks six weeks then go straight to cable this is doctor zhivago this will be packin em in for a year and a half two years thats two years you dont have to work with anybodys movie but mine 
 but the bottom line is im not paramount i have a select group of distributers i deal with i buy their little movies accomplish what i wanna accomplish end of story easy businesslike very little risk 
 the biggest the biggest movie you have ever dealt with lee we are talkin a lot of film a mand have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that and lee you are no idiot 
 i dont know clarence doctor zhivago is a pretty big movie 
 yeah well just stay outta trouble remeber you got a wife to think about quit fuckin around i love you son

 you dont know the chicken places around where you live ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is 
 i really dont know 
 you know what would taste good chicken i havent had chicken in a while chicken would really hit the spot about now chicken and beer definitly absolutely without a doubt wheres a good chicken place around here 
 im really not very 
 get a sixpack of something imported its hard to tell you what to get cause different places have different things if they got fosters get that if not ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has look since you are making a beer run would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well im fuckin starvin to death are you hungry too 
 uh yeah theres a party store down N th 
 go to the liquor store where is there a liquor store around here 
 thats about all i ever eat 
 i can but i dont 
 anything stronger oh probably not beer you can drink beer cant you 
 i think theres a sevenup in there 
 its a fact sicilians have nigger blood pumpin through their hearts if you dont believe me look it up you see hundreds and hundreds of years ago the moors conquered sicily and moors are niggers way back then sicilians were like the wops in northern italy blond hair blue eyes but once the moors moved in there they changed the whole country they did so much fuckin with the sicilian women they changed the bloodline for ever from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin i find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day hundreds of years later sicilians still carry that nigger gene im just quotin history its a fact its written your ancestors were niggers your great great great great greatgrandmother was fucked by a nigger and had a halfnigger kid that is a fact now tell me am i lyin 
 come again 
 you know i read a lot especially things that have to do with history i find that shit fascinating in fact i dont know if you know this or not sicilians were spawned by niggers 
 uhhuh 
 oh dont bother i got one so you are a sicilian huh 
 sure 
 could i have one of those chesterfields now 
 they didnt tell me 
 im gettin angry askin the same question a second time where did they go 
 on their honeymoon 
 thats of minor importance but whats of major fuckin importance is that i believe you where did they go 
 i dont believe you 
 im talkin about a massacre they snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there wouldda gotten away with it but your son fuckhead that he is left his drivers license in a dead guys hand a whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks 
 what are you talkin about 
 now i cant be sure of how much of what he told you so in the chance you are in the dark about some of this let me shed some light that whore your boy hangs around with her pimp is an associate of mine and i dont just mean pimpin in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity well apparently that dirty little whore found out when we are gonna do some business cause your son the cowboy and his flame came in the room blastin and didnt stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead 
 i have seen him 
 look id help ya if i could but i havent seen clarence 
 i have a son of my own about you boys age i can imagine how painful this must be for you but clarence and that bitchwhore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves and i implore you not to go down the road with em you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice 
 no 
 im glad hopefully that will clear up the howfullofshitiam question you have been asking yourself now we are gonna have a little q and a and at the risk of sounding redundant please make your answers genuine want a chesterfield 
 i have heard of blue lou boyle 
 im the antichrist you get me in a vendetta kind of mood you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you my name is vincenzo coccotti i work as a counsel for mr blue lou boyle the man your son stole from i hear you were once a cop so i assume you have heard od us before am i correct 
 i give up who are you 
 do you know who i am mr worley 
 shit are you behind me and robin got a divorce six months ago got myself a new place mirrors all over the bedroom ceiling fans above the bed guyd have to look as ugly as king kong not to get laid in this place im serious a guyd have to look like a gorilla 
 you and robin moved 
 i dont see why not when you gonna come round and see my new place 
 i dont know him is he a nice guy you think he will help me out 
 mcteague 
 yeah and the restaurants on my route and you know i stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these breakins now while i have no proof the name drexl spivey kept comin up whos case is it 
 are you still working security for foster and langley 
 well ted to tell you the truth i found out through the grapevine that it might be and i only said might be the drexl spivey that was responsible for that restaurant breakin on riverdale 
 what about him 
 its about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago drexl spivey 
 well dont just sit there shoot him 
 i dont know he just appeared as magic 
 whered he come from 
 absolutely 
 could we try it now 
 sure no problem 
 if we decided on making him a new york type could you do that 
 thank you 
 that was very good 
 well dont just sit there shoot him 
 i dont know he just appeared as magic 
 whered you come from 
 well the part you are reading for is one of the bad guys theres brian and marty peter brecks already been cast as brian and you are reading for the part of marty now in this scene you are both in a car and bill shatners hanging on the hood and what you are trying to do is get him off whenever you are ready 
 step inside 
 im me i mean thats me 
 look we dont care if you bring in the state milita the volunteer fire department the la thunderbirds the ghost of steve mcqueen and the twelve roman gladiators so long as we get credit for the bust 
 dirty cops we will have to bring in internal affairs on this 
 we talked him into it 
 he will wear a wire 
 i believe he believes him 
 do you believe him 
 sure was 
 that was a good fuckin movie 
 uhhuh 
 that vietnam movie 
 okeedokee its like this krinkle a patrol car stops this dork for speeding they walk up to window and the guys covered in coke so they bring his ass in and me an nicholson go to work on him 
 both you idiots shut up i cant understand shit now whats happened whats going on and what are you talking about 
 you are an actor so act motherfucker 
 dont blow it elliot hes bluffin he just told you so himself 
 this guys gonna kill him 
 hes bluffin ya elliot cant you see that you are an actor remember the show must go on 
 whatta we gonna do hes in an elevator 
 we gotta get him outta there 
 he knows somethings up 
 hows he supposed to see the wire 
 he saw the wire 
 how the fuck could he know 
 he knows 
 hope you are a good actor elliot 
 you do 
 you do more than try 
 so you gotta get him to admit on tape that hes buying this coke 
 we have to show in court that without a doubt a successful man an important figure in the hollywood community is also dealing cocaine 
 like gangbusters now remember if you dont want to go to jail we gotta put your boss in jail 
 this rabbit will do anything not to do time including wearing a wire 
 hes so spooked hed turn over his momma his daddy his twopanny granny and anna and the king of siam if he had anything on him 
 he produced coming home in a body bag 
 to front for him so elliot is workin out the deal between them and his boss a big movie producer named lee donowitz 
 suspects words 
 so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin and krinkle you aint gonna fuckin believe it 
 which wasnt too hard the guy was a real squid 
 nicholson and i go to work on him now er know somthings rotten in denmark cause this dickhead had a big bag and its uncut too so we are sweatin him trying to find out where he got it scarin the shit outta him 
 nicholson and i 
 krinkle you are lookin at the two future cops of the month we have it and if i say we i dont mean me and him im referring to the whole department havent had a decent bust this whole month well we mighta come in like a lamb but we are goin out like a lion 
 krinkle this is it we got it man and its all ours i mean talk about fallin into somethin you shoulda seen it it was beautiful dimes is hittin him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers im hittin him form the right about not likin pussy anymore finally he starts cryin and then it was all over 
 that is of course if you dont catch aids from all your anal intrusions 
 course you will wanna fuck her in the ass pussy just wont feed right anymore 
 and just think when you get out in a few years you will meet some girl get married and you will be so understanding to your wifes needs because you will know what its like to be a woman 
 but there is a bright side though if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throatslitting niggers you will have so much experience to draw on 
 you are a fuckin star and you are gonna be playin your little oneman show nightly for the next two fuckin years for a captive audience 
 or a supporting actor 
 or a bit player 
 you are no longer an extra 
 you got caught its all fun and fuckin games till you get caught but now we gotcha ok mr elliot actor you have just made the big time 
 no dont sit here and feed us some shit 
 but a fuckin baggie 
 not a tiny little vial

 you said we werent real cole 
 no sir i just want to do my part to get us back on topin charge of the planet and i have the experience i know who the people are 
 the food the sky the certain uh sexual temptations you havent become addicted have you cole to that dying world 
 i dont want your women you brainless twit i want to be well 
 women will want to get to know you 
 uh i think so in the mental hospital 
 him you saw that man 
 uh what 
 well 
 we have a very advanced program something very different requires very skilled people 
 no sir 
 uh i didnt hear the 
 wake up cole 
 i went to the surface and i collected specimens like i was told 
 we want you to tell us about last night 
 this is it jameswhat you have been working for 
 we are very close because of you 
 you are still a little disoriented 
 but just until you recover your uh equilibrium 
 cole did you or did you not record that message 
 hes drugged out of his mind hes completely zoned out 
 for a man in your positionan opportunity 
 we want tough minded people strong mentally we have had somemisfortunes with unstable types 
 you dont want to jeopardize that reduction do you cole have it taken away 
 to be determined by the proper authorities 
 hey no problem its probably just another kidnapping featuring jeffreys shrink pardon me make that exshrink this is your leader a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for god knows what whacko irresponsible schemes and now who knows what shes painted out there on our wall 
 wow a guy in a chevy is chasing her and some other guy i cant see 
 shes drawing attention to us thats what shes doing i dont know what you are up to this time mason but you are gonna get us in deep shit 
 whats she doing 
 its the kidnap woman the one who was with the guy who tied us up 
 what are you going to do with us 
 thats him 
 shut up 
 i told you that fuckhead mason would get us into something like this 
 uh so that a vaccine can be developed that will uh allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth 
 so that 
 to find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus 
 and your only goal is 
 that the virus was taken from philadelphia to san francisco then to new orleans rio de janeiro rome kinshasa karachi bangkok then peking 
 meaning 
 san francisco new orleans rio de janeiro rome kinshasa karachi bangkok then peking 
 and it appeared sequentially after that in 
 it was released in philadelphia probably on june N N 
 lets consider again our current information if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on june N N that makes us know that 
 i got into trouble i got arrested but i still got you a specimen a spider but i didnt have anyplace to put it so i ate it it was the wrong year anyway so i guess it doesnt matter 
 forced you why would someone force you to take drugs 
 they forced me to take drugs 
 i think it wasim sure it was N nd street 
 its important to observe everything 
 i will get the tickets and meet you in the gift shop 
 right you are right i have to fix this 
 james if we are identified they are going to send us someplacebut not to key west 
 i was hereas a kid i think you were here too but youlooked just like you look now 
 they may be looking for us james use this you can fix it in the mens room 
 airports all look the same maybe its james your moustache its slipping 
 i know this place this is my dream 
 on the walls they meant the animals when they said we did it 
 thats what they were up to freeing animals 
 i remember youlike this i feel i have known you before i feel i have always known you 
 i mean in my dream i didnt realize it was you theni woke up and ii thought you were gone 
 well you look pretty different too 
 you were in my dream just now i didnt recognize you 
 in a few weeks it will have started or it wont if there are still baseball games and traffic jams armed robberies and boring tv shows we will be so happy we will be glad to turn ourselves in to the police 
 but maybe im wrong maybe you are wrong maybe we are both crazy 
 so we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music so we can appreciate what we have while we have it forgive me psychiatrists dont cry 
 why are we doing this 
 flowers what flowers 
 if we cant change anythingbecause its already happened then we ought to at least smell the flowers 
 i have seen it but i dont remember this part funny its like whats happening to us like the past the movie never changes it cant change but everytime you see it it seems to be different because you are different you notice different things 
 shh dont talk hold still 
 i think i have seen this movie before when i was a kid it was on tv 
 they got your message kathryn they played it for me it was a bad recordingdistorted i didnt recognize your voice 
 you you couldnt have heard me 
 i couldnt resist i was so relieved wait will they hear this nutty woman telling themthey better watch out for the army of the twelve monkeys 
 you you left them a message 
 no superiors no scientists no people from the future its just a carpet cleaning company they have voice mail you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned 
 a carpet cleaning company 
 its a carpet cleaning company 
 iiwe need cash james 
 you want me to rob him 
 jamesdo you remembersix years agoyou had a phone number you tried to call and 
 i want to be here in this time with you i want to becomebecome a whole person i want this to be the present i want the future to be unknown 
 well i cant i meanim trying to i cant believe that everything we do or say has already happened that we cant change whats going to happen that im one of the three billion people who are going to diesoon 
 you said i had delusions that i created a world you said you could explain everything 
 you had a bullet from world war one in your leg james how did it get there 
 i had a dream aboutsomething like that 
 what does this mean to you 
 it wasnt a tv show it was real 
 i think i saw a tv show like that when i was a kid where a boy 
 james you said he was hiding in the barn 
 it was i didntknow 
 the boy in the well how did you know that was just a hoax 
 i dont know i dont remember 
 you disappeared one minute you were there the next minute you were gone did you run through the woods 
 no not really itsits in my mind like you said 
 just like that you were in prison 
 i thought i was inprison again

 first its important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running okay 
 i need help all right they are coming after me 
 it can be dealt with but only if you want to i can help you 
 immentally divergent i would love to believe that 
 nobody is going to wipe out the human race not you or jeffrey or anybody else you have created something in your mind james a substitute reality in order to avoid something you dont want to face 
 jeffrey mason said it was my idea about the virus and suddenly i wasnt sure we talked when i was in the institution and it was allfuzzy the drugs and stuff you think maybe im the one who wiped out the human race it was my idea 
 what made you think that 
 yeah sort of i guess iim sorry i locked you up i thoughti thought i think maybe i am crazy 
 see you can drive after all 
 no idont think so i stole a car and they chased me i hit a tree 
 what have you done did youkill someone 
 you have to give yourself up you know 
 you smell so good

 what do you mean when you were a kid 
 when i was a kid i identified with that kid down there alone in that pipea hundred feet down doesnt know if they are going to save him 
 does that disturb you james thinking about that little boy in the well 
 i just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates so scientists can come back and study it and find a cure so that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth 
 what will you dowhen you find thissecret army 
 a secret army the army of the twelve monkeys i have told you about them they spread the virus thats why we have to get to philadelphia i have to find them its my assignment

 well the guard woke me up he told me i volunteered 
 i asked you why did you volunteer 
 we will get to the spider later mr cole right now we want to know everything that you saw 
 i mashed the spider didnt i 
 and what we believe is whats accepted as truth now isnt it owen psychiatry its the latest religion and we are the priests we decide whats right and whats wrong we decide whos crazy and who isnt im in trouble owen im losing my faith 
 kathryn you know he cant possibly know that you are a rational person you are a trained psychiatrist you know the difference between whats real and whats not 
 for god sakes owen listen to me he knew about the boy in fresno and he says three billion people are going to die 
 he kidnapped you kathryn you saw him murder someone you knew there was a real possibility he would kill you too you were under tremendous emotional stress 
 then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent replaced the grill behind him and that hes wriggling through the ventilation system right now 
 he was fully sedated 
 you see what i mean you are being defensive isnt she being defensive bob 
 i said it was bad judgment what else do you want me to say 
 two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a security officer with a fractured skull 
 okay it was bad judgment but i have the strangest feeling about him i have seen him somewhere and 
 he should have been in restraints it was bad judgment on your part plain and simple why not just cop to it 
 i didnt think i was being defensive i was just 
 dont be defensive kathryn this isnt an inquisition 
 this is a fucking experiment you are our helpless little test animal daddy got that now what fucking virus have you come up with you demented fucking maniac 
 please tell me jeffrey what exactly are you going to do i dont have to tell you im afraid 
 you develop viruses and you are calling me insane typical what does this virus attack dont tell me you sick fuck it doesnt matter have i ever developed a virus do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements wow and im crazy 
 you are insane jeffrey 
 what virus are we talking about dad 
 she knew about it jeffrey she knew you were going to try this 
 whatvirus 
 then how come she knows whats going on 
 who cares what psychiatrists write on walls you think i told her about the army of the N monkeys impossible know why you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous pretendfriendto animals i will tell you why because when i had anything to do with her six years ago there was no such thing i hadnt even thought of it yet 
 that woman iswasyour psychiatrist and now shes spray painting our building 
 expsychiatrist now what about flashlights how many flashlights 
 your psychiatrist did you just say your psychiatrist 
 why dont we forget my goddamn psychiatrist and deal with the task at hand this is important 
 no absolutely not dont tell me anything 
 you really want to know 
 one dozen bolt cutters whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters 
 i will be right herejust in case 
 no thank you 
 james cole thats everything we got none of the james coles on the computer match him no license no prints no warrants nothing you want me to go in with you 
 yes please you said he gave a name 
 you want to go in examine him 
 that would explain the bruises i guess the struggle 
 were you listening we got two officers in the hospital yeah hes in restraints plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse look at him still on his feet 
 you have him in restraints 
 negative for drugs but he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs no drugs you believe that 
 hes been tested for drugs 
 so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of id and he gets agitated starts screaming about viruses totally irrational totally disoriented doesnt know where he is what day it is alla that stuff all they got was his name they figure hes stoned out of his mind its some kinda psychotic episode so they are gonna bring him 
 twelve monkeys honey guess you folks didnt turn on your radio this morning

 i could do that course wed have to go back into town thered be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened a whole crowd of witnesses that wouldnt be too pretty now would it 
 i 
 is that right cant say as i blame you for wanting to head out for a bit i know i have had my fill of this town sixteen years i have been the law and order here so long i forgot why i ever wanted the job in the first place help people i guess keep the peace problem is theres so much peace around here they dont much need me got a lot of speeders but they are speeding through miles of nothing so i cant hardly blame them other than that well there aint much to steal i reckon that the last big crime we had was what would you say mrs mckenna a murder 
 i had a fight with jake i i just wanted to get away for awhile mr stewart was kind enough to take me as far as montrose im going to take a bus to my sisters i thought id stay with her for a few days 
 taking a little trip

 the police dont know that and its going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck i will take you as far as california if we can even make that after that im cutting you loose 
 he was a crooked bastard he would have killed us 
 we killed jake and its a big difference you kill an old man thats one thing nobody cares about an old man you kill a cop and they never stop looking for you never 
 what difference does it make you killed jake 
 are you kidding im not going down with you for killing a cop

 dont yell at me i know its here i know it 
 you are calling jake stupid you 
 if it isnt here why would he wear that stupid key 
 this is good this is real good this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us they will probably just lock us up for being idiots 
 its got to be here i heard him talk about it he bragged about it six steps out three left 
 there isnt theres nothing under here but more floor jesus fucking christ we killed a man for nothing but floor 
 there has to be 
 nothing theres no safe under here 
 dont yell at me 
 oh thats great we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you have never seen thats fucking brilliant 
 im not sure where it is not exactly i never saw it i just heard him talk about it 
 you dont know jesus christ dont you think you should have found out before we killed him 
 i dont know 
 wheres the safe 
 you could have hit him or kneed him in the balls 
 what was i supposed to do 
 why the hell didnt you do anything 
 after dark i will leave the back door unlocked 
 grace grace 
 we dont have to kill him just knock him out and tie him up till we get away 
 you said you couldnt kill anybody 
 the only reason i stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about jake but i have had nothing but time to think about it it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here but we have got to get the money baby we get the money i get the car then we get the hell out 
 i came back for you this morning i came back before i even knew about the money you are what i want 
 are you sure about me i mean 
 i dont give a damn about the money i want you and i want to get us out of this shithole theres only one way to do that 
 is that what changed your mind the money 
 i could if i had jakes money 
 i thought you couldnt leave i thought you couldnt get your car 
 i mean it grace im getting out of here and i want to take you with me 
 because i know you are full of shit

 i have thought about you every second since i left i can still taste you on my lips 
 except i cant get you out of my head grace 
 there is no us remember

 i dont think we have anything to talk about 
 i wanted to talk 
 i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now is there something you wanted 
 jesus christ listen to yourself i cant do it grace i cant do it 
 its not like hes a young man hes had time to live 
 shit 
 is it so bad it would be quick he wouldnt even have to feel it

 what are you talking about 
 i dont know what i was thinking but i cant do it 
 john please 
 i think this heat is making me crazy i was crazy to come back here im crazy for listening to anyone in this town and id sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute in this place 
 john john where are you going 
 wed have to kill him 
 if the keys on him to get the key wed have to 
 its not a combination lock it takes a key he keeps it on him all the time i mean all the time it scratches up against me when we do it 
 i nothing just something he said so if the moneys in a safe wed have to get the combination 
 lied what do you mean 
 onehundredthousand that sonof abitch lied to me 
 near as i can figure must be about a hundredthousand 
 how much money has he got 
 yeah a bird in a gilded cage 
 you live pretty good 
 hes got money in a floor safe in the living room i have never seen it but he talks about it all the time more like brags he loves his money wouldnt think of spending some of it on me 
 from 
 he doesnt give it to us we take it 
 you think jakes going to give me money just so i can take you out of here 
 jake 
 where 
 i know where we could get the money a lot more than onehundredfifty dollars 
 grace i cant i cant even get out of here myself i need a hundredfifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic 
 please i wont hang on you as soon as we get there you can dump me i dont care i just want to get out of here 
 i cant 
 take me with you 
 beautiful beautiful beaches blue water and clear skies as far as you can see 
 is it pretty 
 yeah 
 have you ever been there before 
 from here i dont know far far enough 
 how far is it to california 
 whatever it takes 
 is that so bad its not like i wouldnt try to make him happy for awhile anyway i mean i would do things for him i guess im no good that way i guess i tried to sucker you along like that do you hate me for it i wouldnt blame you if you did but maybe its like you said you just got to do whatever it takes to get out 
 you need a meal ticket is what you mean some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here 
 its not that easy maybe you can take chances maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please i cant i dont want to be alone i need to know im going to be taken care of 
 you just walk away 
 i dont know how 
 you could just leave him 
 all this nothing i have spent my life in this stinking desert it doesnt get to jake like it got to me he doesnt mind being out here he doesnt mind being nothing but a land broker big fish in a small pond he says more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole 
 im still here arent i see this 
 and i take it things didnt much work out the way you planned 
 yeah i guess you are right 
 im guessing no 
 depends on what you call love when i was growing up i had nothing i learned to want everything i wanted more than sierra anyway jake was my ticket hes not much hes older than me different than me but hes got more money than half this town put together i courted him i let him think he was courtin me but i reeled him in like a fish on a line i wanted him i wanted what he could give me and i would have done anything to get him is that love 
 did you ever 
 no 
 you love him 
 yeah but i like the sun i grew up on a reservation the sun the desert they were like a religion to us jakes the same way he loves the desert i guess we are alike that way thats about the only way 
 doesnt the heat bother you 
 if he says thats what happened jake it must be true 
 damn it grace tell him 
 maybe i just want to hear you say it 
 you know what i want 
 thats not an answer what is it you want 
 still playing 
 you never did answer my question 
 im just flesh and blood baby that and a few memories of bad women just like most guys but you already know that you read my fortune thanks for the lemonade 
 maybe i like to find out about a man first maybe i like to know what hes made of 
 i think i can find my own way back to into town 
 really and what game did you want to play you carry my box for me and i fall into bed with you 
 you flirt with me then you run cold you lead me on then slap me down i dont go for being jerked around 
 games 
 all right grace no more games 
 such as 
 i have ideas 
 no more drapes to hang now what should we do 
 nothing like a little liveliness 
 i like them i was sick of looking at this room i think they add a little life 
 like they are made of polyester 
 beautiful 
 like you 
 you can let go of me now im safe how do they look 
 lift me down 
 what 
 there all done lift me down 
 the same thing you do

 those are white words not ours 
 a medicine man 
 from my father he was the tribes shaman 
 whered you learn to do that 
 a little of this a little of that mostly i tell fortunes 
 what do you do anyway 
 i guess it must 
 must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house 
 thank you 
 nice place you got here

 i guess i have got an ego same as any man 
 did you like it me watching you 
 i didnt say it bothered me 
 im sorry i didnt mean to 
 thats good cools you right off i saw you watching me 
 i couldnt stay in this place i wouldnt id just pick up do whatever i had to do and get out 
 somewhere else i have never been anywhere else just once years ago went to the state fair it was nice but it wasnt nothing 
 i pack up and go somewhere else 
 what happens if you lose 
 if you are going to gamble might as well play for high stakes 
 you just travel around no direction no steady work you must like taking chances 
 i dont know i have to make a stop in vegas business to finish then maybe i will head to santa barbara i might be able to pick up some work there 
 where you headed 
 i guess i have got wander in my blood 
 you have been around 
 all over chicago miami detroit just lately albuquerque 
 where you coming from 
 and here i have made you all hot and sweaty 
 not until my cars fixed i dont know how long thats going to take 
 least you can leave 
 yeah my luck i get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert 
 good luck it didnt happen a few miles back maybe they never would have found you day like today youd be dead for sure 
 didnt have a choice my car overheated up the road 
 drove into sierra what for 
 i just drove in this morning 
 you dont have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day 
 why you say that just because i help a lady with her package 
 you are not from around here are you 
 you are welcome grace 
 thank you john 
 i cant argue 
 course they cost a little more than i should really be spending but damn it i dont hardly ever do anything nice for myself i deserve nice things 
 yes i have 
 i saw these in the pennys catalog and i just knew i had to have them you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it 
 that a fact 
 i just got tired of looking at the old drapes had them long as i can remember 
 its nothing really 
 thats all right i got it 
 oh this isnt my car its down a ways i should have parked closer i just didnt think it would be so heavy i could drive up 
 wasnt nothing 
 no trouble at all really 
 its very nice of you to help me that package is kind of heavy and its so hot 
 you should be more careful 
 accident 
 what happened to your hand 
 no i have got it 
 do you want me to carry your pack for you 
 i got it 
 you sure you can manage 
 jesus 
 may i carry your package grace 
 its grace 
 my cup runneth over beauti 
 you are pretty full of yourself arent you 
 maybe but if you didnt i think you would have kept on walking 
 maybe i dont want you to 
 i dont know your real name 
 do you have to call me that 
 my name is john now im not a stranger anymore see how easy it is for us to get to know each other beautiful 
 my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers 
 thats right on my way 
 im just going to my car 
 can i give you a hand beautiful 
 twohundred dollars thats how i put a price on murder 
 twohundred dollars 
 you know what kind of woman grace is you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of sierra what makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasnt doing the same for you whats she to you jake a woman who would have you dead let me kill her all i want is twohundred dollars to get out of here with 
 youd tell me anything to save your pathetic life 
 think about it how do you think i got in here did you hear any glass break did you hear a door splinter how did the evening end after you went to bed did she linger a bit maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked is that what happened 
 what are you babbling about 
 its not me you have to worry about its her she wants you dead jake she wants you dead and she wants your money 
 not from where i stand 
 i dont blame you what man would i admit it okay i came back here and i made it with grace but if you kill me you are making a big mistake 
 you are right i dont give a damn about her but to fuck a mans wife behind his back that just makes a fool out of him i dont like being made a fool of 
 what difference does it make if i slept with her you dont care about grace 
 a drifter a loner a trouble maker like you just passing through town need money so he busts in on an old man only this old mans got himself an automatic and he knows how to use it a mans got to protect his home his wife you are dead boy and your own mother wouldnt convict me 
 what are you you cant you cant kill me 
 sense if i had any sense i would have killed you this morning and been done with it 
 you are not talking sense 
 is that what happened did you even make it out to the desert or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets 
 christ jake please 
 then maybe this afternoon when i sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead 
 nothing happened with me and grace this morning 
 dont jake me boy its a big house odd that you would know your way except maybe you have been in the bedroom before maybe with grace to keep you company 
 come on jake 
 this morning when i came in on you and grace you swore you hadnt so much as been near the bedroom now you make straight for it 
 wh what are you talking about 
 im curious about something im wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedrooms at 
 damn it jake if i dont get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me and if it comes down to me or grace then i pick grace you were going to give me thirteenthousand give me two hundred i will kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it but i need the money i have got to have the money 
 thats a lot of talk a whole lot of talk 
 yeah well a couple of hours ago i just about killed some guy over a girl not for money for a girl and she was just going to stand there and let it happen or let him kill me same way grace played us this morning i dont like that jake not twice in one day and maybe im so pissed id twist the next off my own grandma to get out of here 
 thats a thick change of heart 
 its the truth jake 
 liar 
 i came to kill her 
 you came to take my wife from me 
 i came for grace 
 theres another reason it better be good 
 thats not the reason im here i swear it 
 and then with jake out of the way you could borrow twohundred dollars or maybe twothousand or twentythousand whos to stop you not jake mckenna cause old jake would be dead 
 jake 
 you thought youd come in here in the middle of the night and wham wail off and clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper 
 wait a minute just listen to me 
 maybe you heard old jakes got some money stashed away and you thought youd help yourself to a little 
 its not like that 
 fifty dollars more thats a lot of money when you dont have a dime and whered you plan on getting the money from maybe you thought youd pay your friend jake mckenna a visit 
 he did more work on the car he wants fifty bucks extra for it 
 darrell giving you problems 
 you could say i dont even have it yet 
 trouble with the car again 
 yeah well me too 
 no 
 maybe not this time but somebodys going to get dead around you 
 thats what i like about you jake you are an honest man 
 all i have in the world 
 you think thats a lot of money 
 thirteenthousand dollars had you done it isnt that what we agreed on 
 jake how much were you going to pay me to do the job 
 shut up 
 and next time next time somebody is going to get dead 
 drop it jake 
 came close this time and it scares you 
 shut up 
 i hate loving her i hate the kind of her person she is i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays i hate letting her use me but i love her too much to do otherwise and i certainly love her too much to kill her i couldnt stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull but you you got the killing in you boy 
 you love her but you hate her 
 i guess i have what youd call a lovehate relationship with grace 
 you know so much about killing why dont you do it yourself 
 i know all right i know you are just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a mans wife you have probably bagged a few at that youd probably lie cheat and steal without thinking twice from that youd just turn and walk away but to kill to get that blood on your hands you cant wash that off youd be a marked man for life just like cain and you are a sinner who wants to walk with the saints aint that right boy 
 you know what i mean 
 you are out in the desert the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles and you say the time wasnt right whats the matter you were hoping to get it on home video a keepsake for the grandkids thank god i waited or i never would have gotten it on tape 
 the time wasnt right 
 you didnt kill her 
 no 
 is the job done 
 i went to your place we talked just like you told me we drove out into the desert 
 and tell her what 
 this is what you do go to the house to see her 
 be quiet boy im thinking it cant be done at the house it should be 
 you want to do this yourself i dont have to do this you know 
 how the hell should i know i have never had a wife killed before i guess i should have hired a professional 
 what should i do 
 the sooner its over the sooner you are on your way now listen to me its got to look like an accident thats the thing if it doesnt then its no good i wont get a dime and its my neck that will be on the chopping block while you are living it up somewhere 
 i guess i might as well get this done with 
 if you cant trust the man you have hired to kill your wife 
 do we shake hands 
 dont say that i had a marriage of convenience with grace and look where thats lead well looks like we got ourselves a pact 
 im not your boy jake i dont like you and i dont like what you are i got no choice but to do business with you this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience 
 you drive a hard bargain but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you 
 you are not buying a car for christ sake you are having your wife killed im the one whos neck is stuck out its thirteen or its nothing 
 thats a bit much 
 i need thirteen 
 maybe tenthousand and thats a maybe 
 how much could you get 
 twentythousand i dont have that kind of money i wont get the insurance until months after shes dead i dont imagine you will want to be around after poor graces demise twentythousand thats more money than i could ever get my hands on 
 make it twenty 
 i put it at fiftythousand dollars minus your cut of course which is 
 how do you put a price on murder 
 just to get out of here that doesnt seem much for a murder 
 for that id kill a nun on easter sunday 
 and for that youd kill grace 
 this morning i didnt know how badly id want to get out of this fucking town 
 lets say i do want her dead what is it you want this morning you werent a killer 
 the slimy bastard whos going to do it for you 
 and what does that make you 
 because i think you are a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money 
 what makes you say that 
 you meant it 
 a man doesnt always mean the things he says 
 bullshit you wanted me to kill her 
 that was just loose talk i dont want anybody dead 
 you are the one who brought it up this morning in your car 
 you are talking like a mad man 
 im not rambling 
 i think this heats getting to you the way you are rambling on 
 dont play simple with me jake you want me to spell it out for you i will kill grace if you cut me in on the money 
 i did 
 you said youd cut that up with the man who did her in 
 i do 
 you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife fiftythousand dollars 
 about what you said this morning 
 sweet grace what about her 
 about things about your wife 
 talk about what 
 i was hoping we could talk 
 now what can i do for you 
 isnt that illegal 
 i do all right real estate isnt a bad game such as it is around here the trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it and overvalue when you sell you can turn a few dollars that way 
 nice office you have got 
 you just seem to attract trouble dont you 
 i had a problem getting my car back 
 im surprised to see you i thought youd be halfway to vegas by now 
 no 
 hungry 
 no 
 another accident you have really got to be more careful can i get you a drink 
 just ran into a little trouble 
 good lord what happened to you 
 this is a joke right you just want to rattle me right 
 how do you know if you have never tried 
 im not a murderer mr mckenna 
 because im sick and tired of her little games because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again because i have got a fiftythousand dollar life insurance policy on her and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it 
 why would i kill her 
 would you kill her 
 would i what 
 would you 
 mad like a dog in heat i bet you were i can tell you got a temper on you 
 like you dont know 
 i bet she led you on good didnt she taking you up to the house with that smile of hers bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once then me busting in like some wild bear bet you had a fire going under you 
 cant live with them and you cant shoot em 
 she does at that i knew when i married her she was a free spirit a woman with her looks and a man my age what was i to expect but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you dont think you do so i married her what are you to do eh women 
 thats the sweat of a man who hasnt an honest bone in his body dont be offended lad a man whos got no ethics is a free man i envy you that beside i can hardly blame you that grace has a mind of her own and a body to match dont she eh 
 hey 
 ah i can smell it on you 
 wait a second 
 it wouldnt have made a difference to you now would it not a wit do you know why because you are a man without scruples 
 i hope so listen mr mckenna about your wife if i had known she was married 
 you a sailor man thatd be the life drive across the country step on a boat and just sail away a man could pretty well disappear like that just sail away until all he was was a memory i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile 
 got work i know a man whos got a boat wants me to sail it for him 
 live there 
 i have got to make a stop in vegas then im heading to santa barbara 
 where you headed 
 my car overheated i pulled in to have it fixed

 a hundredfortyfive really 
 let me get this straight you owe me thirteenthousand dollars you call me collect then ask me to wire you onehundredfifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed 
 i had to beat it before the cops showed up i dont have a cent to my name i cant even get my car out of the garage i tell you mr vesci if it werent for bad luck i wouldnt have any at all so i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fiftydollars so i could get my car i will pay it back with the rest of the money 
 you are the gambler you tell me 
 with a shotgun it kills him and it shreads the money i mean what are the odds 
 the old lady 
 no he gets shot by the old lady 
 let me guess this robber he gets your money 
 you dont know the how mr vesci and thats not the half of it i have got your money and i go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed 
 thats a shame john a real shame 
 i know mr vesci i know i was on my way to you its just what a day i have had you are not going to believe whats happened to me i had the money i swear i had it i was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere 
 john what a surprise i expected to be seeing you not talking to you over the phone 
 and you are taking 
 nobodys going to hang we are all gonna walk away with a little something i aint a greedy man and hell you did all the work onehundredthousand dollars split that three ways and it comes out to about thirtythree thousand give or take 
 you aint passing these test son if i cant trust you im gonna have to arrest you 
 thirtythousand dollars 
 whatd you think boy that you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to not by a long shot you are just the most gullible how much did you get 
 sure you do everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house its a wonder the mrs here just now got round to killing him not for lack of trying 
 thats what this is all about a shakedown you picked the wrong people we dont have any money 
 killing jake mckennas got to amount to something he wasnt much of a man but that dont give you the right to murder him and dont tell me you didnt cause i know you did i was there like i said i been watching you 
 i didnt do anything 
 shut up the both of you aint neither one of you too smart especially you boy dont you think i had my eye on you since first you rolled into town you smell like trouble stink of it like a ripe cesspool 
 you bitch you were in on it froom the start 
 and as soon as i see that you are on your way 
 theres nothing in the trunk sheriff 
 i think you might just want to do as i say 
 what for 
 now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me 
 sure sheriff 
 just step from the car nice and slow 
 i dont understand what the 
 why dont you step out of the car son 
 nope no problems up the road 
 is there a problem up the road sheriff 
 just cool down son i aint accusing you of anything serves toby right to get his ass whooped if you hadnt done it somebody else would have 
 sheriff he didnt give me any choice if i hadnt defended myself 
 suppose you have had all you can of sierra what with that ruckus you had with toby oh yes i heard all about that 
 not taking a drive sheriff heading out of town 
 nice night for a drive morning really i guess thats about the only way to keep cool riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day 
 maybe not for you sheriff but i think i have had my fill of your little town 
 stay as long as you like son no rush 
 wish i could help sheriff but if you will excuse me im going over to harlins to pick up my car then im getting the hell out of this place 
 thats too bad i was hoping you were there maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when jamilla shot that biker 
 wouldnt know anything about it 
 there was a young man over at jamillas today when it got hit way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers 
 not as bad as it looks 
 just curious thats a nasty cut you have got 
 no sir and im not going to be around long if thats what you are worried about 
 saw you at the truck stop this morning you are not from around here 
 like i said you really cant blame the boy some people dont know how to avoid trouble know what i mean 
 i guess 
 yep tore him up good and spat out little refined pieces of him nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man 
 jesus 
 his father worked in a strip mine north of here tobys school class went up to the mine one day school takes field trips up there every year big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground anyway on this particular day tobys dad up and falls into the machinery

 you want to do this yourself i dont have to do this you know 
 how the hell should i know i have never had a wife killed before jesus christ you want this job you dont know how to do this i guess i should have hired a professional 
 how do you want it 
 if you cant trust the man you have hired to kill your wife the thing is its got to look like an accident thats the thing if it doesnt then its no good i wont get a dime and its my neck that will be on the chopping block while you are living it up somewhere 
 dont say that i had a marriage of convenience with grace and look where thats lead well looks like we got ourselves a contract 
 im not your boy i dont like you i got no choice but to do business with you lets just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience 
 you drive a hard bargain but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you 
 we are not talking about buying a car jake we are talking about killing your wife its thirteen or its nothing 
 thats a bit much 
 i need thirteen 
 maybe tenthousand and thats a maybe 
 how much could you get 
 no i hate loving her i hate the kind of person she is i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me the bitch she loved to play she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it she tortures me but shes family shes my little girl my baby i couldnt stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull no not me but you you got the killing in you boyhow much you want 
 you love her but you hate her 
 well i guess i have what you call a lovehate relationship with grace 
 the slimy bastard whos going to do it for you you are a jealous man jake if you cant have grace to yourselfwell you are not the sharing kind 
 and what does that make you 
 because you are a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money 
 what makes you say that 
 you meant it 
 a man doesnt always mean the things he says 
 bullshit you wanted me to kill her 
 oh that was just loose talk husband gettin pissed off i dont want anybody dead 
 well then i guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town you are the one brought it up this morning in your car 
 you are talking like a madman 
 im not rambling 
 boy i think this heats getting to you the way you are rambling on 
 dont play simple with me jake you are a betting man you want me to spell it out for you i will kill grace if you cut me in on the money 
 i did 
 you said youd cut that up with the man who did her in 
 i do

 you said you couldnt kill anybody 
 i came back for you this morning i came back before i even knew about the money you are what i want the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about jake but i have had nothing but time to think about it it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here but we have got to get the money baby we get the money i get the car then we get the hell out 
 are you sure about me i mean 
 i dont give a damn about the money i want you and i want to get us out of this shithole theres only one way to do that

 i cant kill grace i cant kill anybody 
 kill him 
 if the keys on him how do we get the key 
 it takes a key he keeps it on himself all the time i mean all the time it scratches up against me when we do it 
 onehundredthousand that sonofabitch 
 oh yeah theres nothing else with jake he dont trust banks he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed he loves it so much he wouldnt think of spending any of it on me i never seen it but i know hes got more than a hunnert thousand at least 
 in cash 
 at night he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it i heard him my mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there maybe more 
 what do you mean 
 jake hides it in a safe in the floor in the bedroom he counts it he loves to sit there and count it 
 where 
 you could get me money i will get you out of here 
 jake never gives me moren twenty bucks at a time like a bird in a cage he dont want me goin anywhere

 after he got his divorce he forced me to marry himbut when i saw her body i swore to her on my soul that some day id get jake for what he did to her 
 you are sick toohe loved to do things to me control me my momit tore her up cause she couldnt do nothing about it she become alcoholicand the funny thing is i liked it i liked being controlled by jake the truth was as far out and crazy as he got i wanted more i wanted to go all the way women say they dont want to be taken like really taken thats bullshit they do the first time he finished with me he said i was a woman now i was N then he started crying like a babywanted me to hold him its a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years but still want to hold him comfort him they found my mom right down there at the bottom of apache leap she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgilsheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane but i will never believe she ran off that cliff by accident she was born on this earth and she loved it she was like me she just wanted to fly away 
 yeah 
 he was a shamanin the mine we had nothin after he died jake took us in gave us a little money he used to call me his little halfbreed he kept mom on the side yknow cause he was married someplace else he had kids in phoenix i think no one knew him around herebut the thing wasyou see he was raping me the whole timefor years he loved to do things to me believe it or not he used to say he was in love with my ass yever been in love with a womans ass 
 you mean the shaman 
 nothing i understand better than a mess 
 its just such a mess with jake i mean 
 try me 
 youd never understand 
 grace i have been fucked over too many times by too many women you are becoming the queen of hot and cold 
 get out of town bobby as quick as you can 
 dont feel like nothing 
 nothing 
 whats the mattergrace 
 is that so bad its not like i wouldnt try to make him happy for awhile anyway i mean i would do things for him i guess im no good that way i guess i tried to sucker you along like that do you hate me for it i wouldnt blame you if you did but maybe its like you said you just got to do whatever it takes to get out 
 you need a meal ticket is what you mean some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here 
 its not that easy maybe you can take chances maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please i cant i dont want to be alone i need to know im going to be taken care of 
 walk away 
 i dont know how 
 you could leave him 
 all this nothing it doesnt get to jake like it gets to me he says he dont mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole 
 im still here arent i see this 
 i take it things didnt much work out the way you planned 
 yeah i guess you are right 
 im guessing no 
 i let him think he was courtin me but i reeled him in like a fish on a line i wanted him i wanted what he could give me and i would have done anything to get him is that love 
 is that why you are with him 
 depends on what you call love i grew up on a reservation a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere thats where they stick indians bobby thats where they leave us to die my brother killed himself when he was N cause he couldnt take it anymore theres no hope there jake was my ticket out mom and me 
 did you ever 
 no 
 you love him 
 yeah but i like the sun i grew up on a reservation the sun the desert they like a religion to us jakes the same way he loves the desert i guess we are alike that way thats about the only way 
 doesnt the isolation bother you

 no 
 four 
 how old is jeb 
 my son jeb its a gift for him 
 once again please 
 you have made a considerably wise decision 
 wrap it up 
 its like you resent us david resent the life you have 
 i dont know megan 
 why 
 that counts 
 i had a nightmare one night and i didnt wake you up so you could tell me it was okay i think that was the first time does that count 
 maybe it wasnt a specific moment maybe it 
 its finished i won 
 what about the game 
 think carefully 
 im not sure 
 my turn when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it 
 soft and wet thats very interesting 
 we are supposed to be honest 
 what was that 
 soft and wet by the artist formerly known as prince 
 my turn whats your favorite song 
 i didnt know that mines still brown 
 as a color not as rust you know a rust colored paint or wood 
 rust 
 i think rust 
 jeremy what the hell are you doing 
 he didnt do anything he just told me his theory its sad when patients get like that they loose reality 
 jesus 
 oh elijah price came to visit me at the center today 
 out again 
 yes 
 would you like to try going 
 hes dealing with a lot of things i think he needs to find answers himself 
 hes just laying in bed hes pretty upset he wont talk 
 you use your sleeve 
 what do i do when im around someone i know 
 not often but it is possible most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits they dont know how long the shadow really is they dont know how far away the real limits are standing they stop out of fear 
 when you work with clients on machines do they sometimes just jump up a level or two do something they didnt know they were capable of 
 i was hoping you would call me but anyway i decided not to wait i was thinking it might be nice to go to dinner together 
 i remember you 
 my name is megan inverso we went to college together 
 yeah megan where are you calling from 
 yes is this david 
 megan 
 oh 
 i have come to a decision 
 matching shirt and shorts it was brutal 
 oh shit 
 the mitchell barbecue three years ago 
 when was the last time i wore pink 
 no thats it 
 is there anything else you wanted to ask me while im up when was the last time you wore pink when was the last time you drank soup standing up final call for strange questions at two in the morning 
 yes 
 is that what you wanted to ask me 
 it means we are probably to tired to remember 
 thats strange isnt it not remembering one fever or a cold or a sore throat what do you think that means 
 i cant remember 
 megan do you ever remember me getting sick 
 not a specific day whats this about 
 do you remember me getting sick 
 okay 
 i havent been sick this year i know that 
 i dont know its been a while 
 oh 
 hes asleep 
 is jeremy okay 
 i know 
 i dont want to drag this out too long for jeremy 
 im still going to new york just not this second 
 what does that mean 
 i dont think i got the job in new york 
 no and i have been sick i spent a week in a hospital when i was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool they were dunking me i swallowed water they didnt know it and they almost killed me heroes dont get killed like that normal people do 
 are you finished 
 you have a problem elijah my wife is right somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it 
 i never said you couldnt be killed i never said that 
 stop messing with my life elijah my son almost shot me last night he wanted to prove you were right 
 thats not what i witnessed david 
 i must have felt some lump in his back when i bumped him most guns have a black or silver handle i had a fiftyfifty shot at the color 
 the car accident you were in was there anyone else involved 
 quick 
 one last question 
 i have to go now 
 or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants 
 the guy might not have been carrying anything 
 its an exaggeration of the truth maybe its based on something as simple as instinct like being able to touch someone and tell whether they have done something wrong or the level of what they have done wrong 
 okay i dont want to play this game anymore 
 characters in comic books are often attributed special powers xray vision things of that sort 
 listen i got to be on the sidelines during the game you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at 
 you are skill 
 i dont know what you are asking 
 have you ever tried to develop it 
 yes 
 telling when people have done something wrong 
 like what 
 you have good instincts when it comes to things like that 
 i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants like on tv 
 but not a knife 
 i thought he was carrying something 
 you thought he was carrying a knife 
 probably the army jacket those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show 
 how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon 
 i got you a seat in the seven hundred level its nosebleed territory but at least you wont get spit on 
 that guy in green sometimes people carry weapons in here then they drink too much they are team isnt doing so well bad things happen we do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying if hes carrying he will step out of line 
 is there a problem 
 just give me a minute 
 you could have poured coffee in starbucks you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet you could have been one of ten thousand things but in the end you chose to protect people you made that decision and i find that very very interesting now all i need is your credit card number 
 are you for real 
 why is it do you think that of all the professions in the world you chose protection 
 we have already begun 
 we are not proceeding anywhere together 
 not money but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution 
 what do you want 
 i have come to understand that an ill advised purchase in the parking lot 
 its for last weeks game 
 i see guys like you all the time in my work you find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story utterly convincing and somewhere in there you slip it in i just need your credit card numberi just need a small down payment 
 you have misunderstood 
 whats this about this is obviously some scam is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment 
 technically no i gambled that you would attend the church service i just waited for you 
 at the church you were following me werent you 
 what was your idea elijah 
 this city has had its share of disasters well publicized ones it was around the time of that plane crash when it first entered my head and there it stayed as i waited and watched the news over the years and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed and just like that an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality 
 the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head 
 you forgot the now im going to tell you what the hell is going on step see usually that comes before the its over step and it always always comes before the you can go step what is over 
 you assumed wrong 
 i assumed because of the train 
 was it serious 
 in college a car accident 
 whats he talking about 
 your answer to my question its one thing to have never been injured in your life but to state that you have never taken ill well thats a whole new level 
 skeptical about what 
 seventyfive percent thats not nearly good enough for me im extremely skeptical 
 seventyfive percent 
 how certain are you that you havent been sick in your life 
 i dont know for sure i dont think so 
 you have never been sick 
 yes he is 
 hes kind of a miracle 
 im very proud of him hes been through a lot in his life a lot of ups and downs a lot of bad spells a couple id thought had broken him i mean emotionally they were bad but he made it yes he did 
 hes doing well today 
 we are 
 hes spoken of you he says you are becoming friends 
 its a pleasure to meet you im david dunne 
 i am im helping him with the sale 
 just now they want you to come down to his school 
 when 
 theres a message for you at the office your kid was hurt 
 yeah 
 consider him packed i didnt like his attitude struttin around with a cane and shit 
 send him packing im not walking all the way over there 
 hes got the most beautiful eyes the hell kind of question is that hes a guy 
 whats he look like 
 dunne its jenkins we got a guy at gate N c with a bogus ticket says he knows you he wont tell me his name 
 jeremy if you pull that trigger im going to leave im going to go to new york 
 dont be scared 
 jeremy listen to what 
 i will just shoot him once 
 im not i just didnt connect it 
 you are lying 
 that was me they were talking about i almost died that was me 
 elijah was wrong 
 you wont get hurt 
 you are secret identity that man was right 
 know what 
 i know now 
 do you know why 
 thats great 
 im not scared 
 i see 
 im sleeping in my room 
 theres no more left 
 all of it 
 how many did you put on that time 
 get mom 
 what do you do if something happens 
 two hundred and seventy 
 how much is it 
 i lied 
 how much did you take off 
 what if he wasnt aloud to kick and you were really mad at him 
 no jeremy 
 i mean if you knew karate 
 no 
 how much can you lift 
 you put too much thats two hundred and fifty pounds 
 what if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year 
 no 
 what if you worked out everyday for six months you think you could beat him then 
 no 
 you think you could beat up mike tyson i mean before he started wiggin out and eating peoples ears 
 theres nothing to do 
 i will help you 
 im going to work out 
 what things 
 jeremy im going in i have to do some things 
 just one 
 whyd you do that 
 just play one set of downs i told them you were great 
 im going to go in 
 in under six seconds i have heard 
 he going pro in the draft they say he can run the fifty 
 how about your room then if you get scared like before you can come back in here 
 i wont make any noise 
 i think its be better if i was alone 
 i want to sleep here tonight 
 jeremy why dont you go sleep with your mom 
 thats what i said to my son he said theres always two kinds the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands and then theres the real threat the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind 
 he doesnt look very threatening 
 is david dunne there 
 yeah hello 
 this kid is six foot two two hundred and forty pounds he runs the fifty in under six seconds hes going to be a god 
 not really 
 im meeting a player from temple university hes a cornerback you like football 
 you represent someone in philadelphia 
 but im afraid of water so thats been holding my career back a little bit 
 is that right 
 what a coincidence im a male synchronized swimmer and im looking for representation 
 its my field i represent athletes im an agent 
 you like sports 
 no 
 did you get up from your seat 
 no 
 was your family traveling with you 
 yes where are the rest of the passengers 
 in the passenger car 
 against a window 
 where were you sitting on the train 
 fine 
 you are in the emergency room of the university of pennsylvania hospital you were in a serious accident hows your vision 
 okay 
 how are you feeling 
 i believe comic books are based loosely on reality i believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth i believe your husband is one of those individuals 
 for a second there i thought you were a fanatic 
 i own a comic book museum its called the limited edition 
 is this a religious thing 
 and what was that explanation 
 there have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years i have followed each one of them a seventhreeseven crashes on take off one hundred and seventytwo die no survivors a hotel fire downtown two hundred and eleven die no survivors and am amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city one hundred and thirty one die one survivor he is unharmed i have spoken with your husband about his survival i suggested a rather unbelievable explanation since then i have come to believe that my explanation however unbelievable is in fact true 
 and everyone lived happily ever after 
 any way fate stepped in and took football out of the equation 
 you and my mother would have a special connection 
 football wasnt the kind of life i wanted for ten years id be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game and if it wasnt that call it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion i have seen way too much of it in my job i can barely take it when my clients are in pain i dont hate the game i admire the amount of skill it involved and like everyone else i was in awe of how he could play it but i couldnt give him my heart and then have something happen to him and it always does with that game its not a thing many people would understand 
 how so 
 see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together our car flipped on an icy road we were both injured he couldnt play football anymore if that hadnt happened we wouldnt have been together 
 now you are going to have to tell me more 
 how did you get together 
 twelve years 
 how long have you been married 
 we are going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this it works the quadriceps 
 on a bench across the street 
 where is it 
 well go get it then 
 forget why do you want it or not 
 why 
 i got a present for you 
 you cant do anything about that you might fall between that chair and this television if thats what god has planned for you thats whats going to happen you cant hide from it in your room 
 im not going out anymore im not getting hurt again this was the last time i told you 
 no more sitting in this room i have let it go on long enough 
 innocent of what 
 you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man you big asshole 
 on account of they seen you was beatin on their friend 
 if they was just here for the fuckin how come they lit out the back window

 down the street and across greelys beer garden and billiard parlor just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards 
 now this strawberry alice person tell me again 
 a wise policy but if you did i can assure you the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand in awe whereas a president i mean why not shoot a president 
 i wouldnt point no pistol at nobody sir 
 why if you were to point a pistol at a king or a queen sir i can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied 
 just wondered anybody could be scared

 i have done that killed women and children i have killed most everything that walks or crawls an now i have come to kill you little bill for what you done to ned now step aside boys 
 i guess you are threefingered jack out of missouri killer of women and children 
 he should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend 
 well uh it aint loaded 
 there aint no snakes in here mister hendershot 
 uh yeah yeah 
 i guess you just carry it for snakes an such 
 i i guess i might but like i said i aint armed 
 well mister hendershot if i was to call you a no good sonofabitch an a liar an if i was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul well i guess then you would show me your pistol right quick an shoot me dead aint that so 
 uh william uh hendershot 
 whats your name 
 like i said i 
 you are spillin your whiskey mister 
 i dunno i mean i guess not no they aint carryin no guns 
 them friends of yours in the back they carryin pistols 
 well uh i i aint got no uh firearms 
 ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the county office day or night i guess you didnt read it with the weather an all 
 uh no no i aint drunk 
 uh hang the uh carpenter i 
 what 
 maybe you should hang the carpenter 
 huh oh another one huh shit i guess im clean out of receptacles 
 uh sheriff uh 
 i do not like assassins an men of low character like your friend english bob but bob aint no coward who will cry to your face an then 
 no but i cant abide them kind an you will find a lot of them in the saloons tramps an drunk teamsters an crazy miners sportin pistols like they was bad men but not having no sand nor character not even bad character 
 did you kill him 
 well jim i says it makes me sick to see a man struttin around and packin two pistols an a henry rifle and cryin like a baby 
 give it to him 
 rrrreally you rrreally w wwant 
 wouldnt be no good if it wasnt you got to cock it though 
 is is it loaded 
 thems the keys all you gotta do is shoot me an you an english bob can ride out free as birds 
 then he will kill you that is why there are so few dangerous men like old bob there an like me it aint so easy to shoot a man anyhow an if the sonofabitch is shootin back at you well it will unnerve most fellas look here let me show you somethin see this here pistol 
 but if he doesnt miss 
 he will be hurryin and he will miss that there is as fast as i can pull an aim an hit anythin moren ten feet away unless its a barn 
 but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first 
 well he wasnt gonna wait for corky to grow no new hand he walked over real close bein drunk an shot him through the liver 
 you you mean english bob killed him while 
 bam that walker colt blew up in his hand which was a failing common to that model now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end 
 and 
 well that bullet whizzin by panicked corky an he done the wrong thing pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe meantime bob aims good and squeezes off another but hes so drunk he misses again an hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar well now the duck of death is good as dead cause this time corky does right an aims real good no hurry 
 some folks did call old corky two gun but not because he was sportin two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that walker colt he carried an the only insultin he done was stickin that big dick of his in some french lady that old bob was sweet on well one day corky walked into the blue bottle and before he knows whats happening bob takes a shot at him and misses on account of hes drunker than hell 
 but he was called 
 first off corky didnt carry two pistols though he should of 
 you were there 
 well mister beauchamp i was at the blue bottle saloon in wichita the night english bob killed corky corcoran an i didnt see you there nor no woman nor no twogun shooters nor nothin like that 
 i believe that to be an accurate description of the events sir albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which 
 duck i says you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman corcoran said the duck you must apologize but two gun corcoran would have none of it and cursing he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but the duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns 
 duke 
 meaning the duck himself i guess 
 uh i can assure you mister daggett the events described within are based on the accounts of eye witnesses and 
 well mister beauchamp from what i read of this here book id have to say the writin aint a whole lot different from the pitcher 
 uh its uh generally considered desirable in the publishing business to ah take certain license in depicting the cover scene for ah purposes involving the ah market place 
 uh duke 
 that is you there aint it bob the duck of death

 his name was arturo marquez a petty smuggler out of argentina he was arrested in new york last year for trafficking he escaped to california and got picked up in long beach they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again get this edie finneran was called in to advise the proceedings 
 i dont think he does not exactly but theres a lot more to his story i want to know why twentyseven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninetyone million dollars worth of dope that wasnt there above all i want to be sure that dean keaton is dead 
 thats crazy dave and it doesnt matter he has total immunity and his story checks out he doesnt know what you want to know 
 you know damn well what i think 
 and i am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions 
 if it was a dope deal wheres the dope if it was a hit who called it in 
 no no no no no 
 this wont be an interrogation just a friendly chat to kill time 
 even if i was to let you talk to him he wont talk to you hes paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired 
 maybe so but im no rat agent kujan you tricked me thats all i wont keep my mouth shut cause im scared iN keep it shut cause i let keaton down by getting caught edie finneran too and if they kill me its 
 where are you going to go verbal you gonna run turn states evidence you might never see trial if somebody wants to get you you know they will get you out there 
 iN take my chances thank you its tougher to buy the cheapest bagman than it is to buy a cop 
 you posted twenty minutes ago captain leo wants you out of here asap unless you turn states 
 im not bait no way i post today 
 is he keyser soze i dont know verbal it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield like you said a spook story but i know keaton and someone out there is pulling strings for you stay here and let us protect you 
 you think hes 
 you are not safe on your own 
 you know what its like agent kujan to know you will never be good not good like you you got good all fucked around i mean a stand up guy i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything cause i was a cripple shit i wasnt 
 why lie about everything else then 
 i didnt know i saw him die i believe hes dead christ 
 it was all keaton we followed him from the beginning 
 if hes dead verbal if what you say is true then it wont matter it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york wasnt it tell me the truth 
 he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to customs has been 
 i knew him he would never 
 he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead you saw him die right or did you you had to hide when the first police cars showed up you heard the shot just before the fire but you didnt see him die 
 this is all bullshit 
 he used all of you to get him on that boat he couldnt get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man the one man that could identify him 
 edie 
 the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran 
 no no no no no 
 no 
 keaton was keyser soze 
 no 
 no verbal you werent friends keaton didnt have friends he saved you because he wanted it that way it was his will 
 because he was my friend 
 i dont buy that reform story for a minute and even if i did i certainly dont believe he would send you to protect her so why 
 edie 
 why did he want you to live a onetime dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless ratcripple no sir why 
 he wanted me to live 
 verbal he left you behind for a reason if you all knew soze could find you anywhere why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat 
 but how wait you are saying soze sent t us to kill someone 
 there were no drugs on that boat it was a hit a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it men he knew he could march into certain death 
 i dont 
 but keaton had edie finneran was his extradition advisor she knew who he was and what he knew 
 i said i never heard of him 
 his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey the money wasnt there for dope the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them 
 i never heard of him 
 he was a stool pigeon for the justice department he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser soze and had intimate knowledge of his business including but not exclusive to drug trafficking and murder 
 it was keyser soze agent kujan i mean the devil himself how do you shoot the devil in the back 
 but keaton 
 i was afraid okay somehow i was sure it was keyser soze at that point i couldnt bring myself to raise my gun to him 
 then why didnt you help him 
 i dont understand what you are saying i saw keaton get shot i swear to you 
 you know you have known this whole fucking time give it to me 
 i dont know what you are talking about 
 try to reef lying to me now i know everything 
 yes you do you know what im getting at the truth try to tell me you didnt know try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton 
 i dont 
 dont shine me verbal no more stalling you know what im getting at 
 i dont have a minute are you saying it was keyser soze you told the da you didnt know who it was 
 wait a minute 
 a man in a suit with a slim build tall 
 i tried believe me but keaton wouldnt have it it was too farfetched for him keaton was a grounded guy an excop to a cop the explanation is never that complicated its always simple theres 
 why didnt you say anything 
 i wanted to i thought we could make it 
 kobayashi told us where we could find fenster 
 what call 
 mcmanus was furious he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit that night we got the call 
 then what 
 what happened 
 give a guy a break huh 
 you are stalling verbal 
 the quartet is part of the bit about kobayashi the quartet was in my file along with every other thing i had done since high school see aliases middle men they knew me better than i did they knew all of us 
 can we just get back to kobayashi 
 oh but its not if i hadnt been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets i never would have took off for new york i never would have met keaton see that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything 
 this is totally irrelevant 
 that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie illinois 
 gee thanks dave bangup job so far extortion coercion you will pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker the same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me they will bail me out fuck you you think you can catch keyser soze you think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out if he comes up for anything it will be to get rid of me after that my guess is you will never hear from him again 
 so why play into his hands we can protect you 
 wheres your head agent kujan where do you think the pressures coming from keyser soze or whatever you want to call him knows where i am right now hes got the front burner under your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later immunity was just to deal with you assholes i got a whole new problem when i post bail 
 if there is a keyser soze he will be looking for you 
 i have got immunity now what can you possibly offer me 
 turn states evidence take the stand on this and we will hear it out 
 you tell me agent kujan if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor what would you say 
 and this is why you never told the da 
 i came clean i told it like it happened on the boat so what if i left out how i got there its got so many holes in it the da would have told me to blow amnesty out my ass so you got what you wanted out of me big fucking deal 
 keaton always said and quoti dont believe in god but im afraid of him and quot well i believe in god and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze 
 do you believe in him verbal 
 and why leave this out when you talked to the da 
 right 
 came from redfoot 
 kobayashi 
 so this lawyer 
 convince me tell me every last detail N scene deleted N N int hospital day N + kovashs room is now filled with people jack baer stands next to daniel metzheiser a balding man in his forties next to him is doctor plumber across from her is ridgly waiters 
 no but im sure keatons dead 
 is he the one that killed keaton 
 there was a lawyer kobayashi 
 not from me you piece of shit there is no immunity from me you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind every criminal i have put in prison 
 the da gave me immunity 
 you think i dont know you held out on the da what did you leave out of that testimony i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes 
 what lawyer 
 he wasnt behind anything it was the lawyer 
 i dont think you do but you say you saw keaton die i think you are covering his ass and hes still out there somewhere i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor my bet is hes using you because you are stupid and you think hes your friend you tell me hes dead so be it i want to make sure hes dead before i go back to new york 
 i dont know about that 
 do i keaton was under indictment a total + of seven times when he was on the force + in every case witnesses either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before they could testify when they t finally did nail him for fraud he spent + five years in sing sing he killed three prisoners inside one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death of course i cant prove this but i cant prove the best part either 
 you got him wrong 
 let me tell you something i know dean keaton i have been investigating him for three years the guy i know is a cold + blooded bastard lapd indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force so dont sell me the hooker with the heart of gold + 
 you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t keaton it wasnt like that sure he knew but edie had him all turned around r im telling you straight i swear + 
 come on keaton was a cop for four years who else would know the taxi service 
 that was all fenster and mcmanus 
 sure and im supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasnt his idea 
 he loved her 
 oh come on verbal who do you think you are talking to you really expect me to believe he retired for a woman bullshit he was using her 
 you wanted to know what happened after the lineup im telling you 
 heartwarming really i feel weepy 
 im not a rat 
 iN get right to the point im smarter than you iN find out what i want to know and iN get it from you whether you like it or not 
 no 
 the first thing i learned on the job know what it was how to spot a murderer lets say you arrest three guys for the same killing put them all in jail overnight the next morning whoever is sleeping is your man if you are guilty you know you are caught you get some rest let your guard down you follow 
 iN be sure to mention that to him 
 theres nothing in there about ruby 
 i know ruby hes very big on respect likes me very much 
 he didnt have my lawyer 
 you know ruby is in attica 
 you know a religious guy named john paul 
 you know a dealer named ruby deemer verbal 
 well i do have the weapons charge im looking at six whole months hard time 
 oh i know sweet deal you have total immunity 
 thats been suppressed anything in there is inadmissible 
 according to your statement you are a shortcon operator run of the mill seams everything you do you learned from somebody else 
 i just want to hear your story 
 you trying to get a rise out of me agent kujan 
 keaton was a piece of shit 
 sure fifteen years ago but he was a good thief anyway the cops wouldnt let him go legit 
 he was a corrupt cop verbal 
 i know he was good 
 i know you liked keaton i know you think he was a good man 
 i told the da everything i know 
 verbal i know you know something i know you are not telling us everything 
 sure and i appreciate that and i want to help you agent kujan i like cops i would have liked to have been a fed myself but my cp was 
 verbal you know we are trying to help you 
 counselor you are bluffing shall i push for misdemeanor two 
 counselor you are insulting me 
 weapons misdemeanor one 
 you are joking 
 mr kint will plead guilty to weapons possession 
 iN take my chances then iN feel safer without a job if a man like mr kint is behind bars 
 then prosecute i will be very impressed to see if the district attorney manages to bring in twentyseven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy i would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged and quotfaceless people in city hall and quot you mention 
 counselor i will prosecute your client 
 immunity 
 mayi be frank counselor i suspect your political power as much as i respect it i dont know why mr kint has so many faceless allies in city hall and i dont care the embarrassment he helped cause the city of new york will not happen here 
 no provisions nothing my clients testimony for his immunity 
 the district attorneys office will comply provided 
 my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings in exchange his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible 
 ah how did they treat you 
 yes 
 good you ever been inside a hospital 
 im fine 
 abrams yes how are you today 
 abrams 
 mr abraham 
 as far as we know nothing 
 and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr thompson 
 very good 
 how goods your intelligence 
 nothing 
 what did he find 
 shes the only nurse who isnt testifying for the doctors 
 why did he go to see mary rooney 
 yes 
 i know that answer if we went to trial would we win 
 well of course its always dangerous 
 if we were to go to trial would we win the case 
 all right but lets keep the price down i have called ed concannon he recommends that we continue to respond as if we are going to trial 
 so what i want to do is stop it here im going to make him an offer i want to do it myself i want it to come from me 
 no absolutely and we are going to see that it is not 
 i want to settle this thing and be done with it i dont want the archdiocese exposed 
 neither does he thats where he loses this mans scared to death to go to court we only have to call his bluff 
 no we dont want this case in court 
 this is a nuisance suit hes looking for small change hes asking for six hundred thousand and betting we dont want to go to court 
 tell me about this case 
 the mans an ambulance chaser 
 four cases in three years 
 accused not indicted he resigned the firm divorced nineteen seventy galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in seventyeight since then hes been on his own four cases before the circuit court he lost them all he drinks 
 he was accused of jury tampering 
 that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life shes in a coma her life is gone she has no family she has no home shes tied to a machine she has no friends and the people who should care for her her doctors and you and me have been bought off to look the other way we have been paid to look the other way i came in here to take your money i brought snapshots to show you so i could get your money i cant take it if i take it if i take that money im lost im just going to be a rich ambulance chaser i cant do it i cant take it 
 what is the truth 
 and no one will know the truth 
 nothing that we can do can make that woman well 
 yes it would be 
 that was our insurance companys recommendation 
 because it struck me how neatly three went into the amount two hundred ten thousand that would mean i keep seventy 
 yes 
 you thought it was just 
 we thought it was just 
 how did you settle on the amount 
 its a generous offer mr galvin nothing can make the woman wellbut we try to compensateto make a gesture 
 does that mean im back for awhile 
 they want to settle it means a lot of money 
 what does it mean 
 thats the call that im waiting for 
 frank galvins whos calling please bishop brophys office 
 this is going to drive the ante up 
 a mrs doneghy called i told you that 
 you know what that would mean to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he will testify 
 it looks that way 
 he wants to testify 
 mickey told him to call hes some very hotshot surgeon at mass commonwealth he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of deborah ann kaye you meet him at the hospital

 my god we tried to save heryou cant knowyou cant know 
 you reached down into death now isnt that right 
 yes 
 to save her and to save the baby is that 
 we did everything we could 
 a patient riddled with complications questionable information on her on her admitting form 
 yes 
 you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear isnt that what you did 
 well we 
 and what did your team do 
 thats right 
 and her heart stopped and she wasnt getting oxygen 
 she threw up in her mask lets cut the bullshit say it she threw up in her mask 
 shed aspirated vomitus into her mask 
 tell me one 
 well many reasons actually 
 why wasnt she getting oxygen 
 its a common medical expression its a crash program to restore the heartbeat dr marx cut an airway in her trachea to get her oxygen her and the babymsnevins 
 `code blue what does that mean 
 we went to code blue 
 what did these people do when her heart stopped 
 mary rooney the obstetrical nurse 
 ms nevins nurseanesthetist drmarx of course 
 dr towler who was in the operating room with you 
 thank you when debby 
 when she 
 anything special about the case 
 yes 
 you were there to help dr marx deliver her baby were you not 
 yes 
 answer affirmatively simply keep those answers to three words you werent `part of a group you were her anesthesiologist isnt that right 
 i was one of a group of 
 you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy 
 i was her doctor 
 say it 
 yes 
 whatever the `truth is lets hear that you were her doctor 
 dont equivocate be positive just tell the truth 
 no actually she was referred to me she was dr hagmans patient 
 and you would come here and on a slip of memory four years ago youd ruin their lives 
 objection 
 your honor your honor 
 almost nine minutes causing brain damage 
 we have touched on this his own witness has said 
 to get her heartbeat back 
 objection we have 
 frank galvin we have met before 
 ed concannon 
 objection 
 i did 
 do you indeed i will bet you do fine fine we will save the court the time we will admit the doctor as an `expert witness fine 
 sir yes when a thing is wrongas in this case i am available i am seventyfour years old i am not boardcertified i have been practicing medicine for fortysix years and i know when an injustice has been done 
 yes we have heard that doctor you testify quite a bit against other physicians isnt that right you you are available for that when you are paid to be there 
 im on the staff of 
 uhhuh still practice a lot of medicine 
 i am seventyfour years old 
 how old are you 
 `methodology and techniques of anesthesiology yes 
 of anesthesiology 
 methmethodology and technique 
 what book is that 
 through through his book 
 how is that 
 i know of him 
 do you know dr robert towler 
 im just an md 
 orthopedics 
 no 
 neurology 
 no 
 im sure it is but this is massachusetts doctor certified in internal medicine 
 no i am not its quite common in new york state 
 are you boardcertified in anesthesiology doctor 
 just as you are sir 
 engaged to render an opinion for a price is that correct you are being paid to be here today 
 that is correct i was engaged to render an opinion 
 dr thompson just so the jury knows you never treated deborah ann kaye is that correct 
 im going to uphold that 
 thank you your honor further ms costello is a rebuttal witness as a `surprise witness she may only serve to rebut direct testimony as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here 
 the document is disallowed the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form its unsubstantiated and we cant accept a copy in preference to the original 
 one moment mr concannon 
 thank you your honor we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana us N point N and N through N of the uniform code the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed and your honor having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now we object to the admission of the xerox form 
 you may step down 
 no further questions 
 i will rule on that presently proceed 
 objection this is riexpect us to accept a photocopy we have the original right 
 mr galvin rebuttal 
 nothing further your honor 
 mr concannon 
 my doctors didnt want a settlement at any price they wanted this cleared up in court they want their vindication i agree with them but for today the offer stands before we begin the publicity of a trial for today only when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn as long as you understand that its got to be that way 
 huh 
 your honor bishop brophy and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars 
 after after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma dr towler called me in he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form and he told me to change the form he told me to change the one to a nine or else or else he said he said hed fire me he said id never work againwho were these men who were these men i wanted to be a nurse 
 and why please tell us would you think that 
 i thought i would need it 
 what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears this is awhy why would you do that 
 because i kept a copy i have it right here 
 you didnt write that figure and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years 
 yes i yes i signed it yes but i i didnt write that figure 
 you have just said you signed it 
 thats not my handwriting 
 you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago 
 i do yes 
 `they lied indeed when did they lie and do you know what a lie is 
 they lied 
 you know these doctors could have settled out of court they wanted a trial they wanted to clear their names 
 i 
 then please which is correct you have sworn today the patient ate one hour ago four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago which is the lie when were you lying 
 iyes 
 and wasnt that an oath these are your initials here kc when you signed this chart you took an oath no less important than that which you took today isnt that right isnt that right 
 i 
 now id like to ask you something four years ago when you were working as a nurse are you aware that drs towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed 
 yes 
 sworn before god you would tell the truth 
 yes 
 just now 
 yes 
 in fact you have just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury you have just sworn to that isnt that right 
 no 
 you would not 
 i wouldnt do it 
 yes it is a crime a serious crime 
 its a crime 
 you are aware of the penalties for perjury 
 i understand i went to the bar association they tell me you are going to be disbarred 
 if i could accept the offer right now i would they took it back 
 you guys you guys you are all the same the doctors at the hospital youits what im going to do for you but you screw up its `we did the best that we could im dreadfully sorry and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives 
 im going to win this casemistmr doneghyim going to the jury with a solid case a famous doctor as an expert witness and im going to win eight hundred thousand dollars 
 what you thought what you thoughtim a workingman im trying to get my wife out of town we hired you we are paying you i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred 
 i swear to you i wouldnt have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case 
 you ruined my life misterme and my wifeand i am going to ruin yours you dont have to go out there to see that girl we been going four years four yearsmy wifes been crying herself to sleep what they what what they did to her sister 
 its all right mickey 
 im going to have you disbarred im going to have your ticket you know what you did do you know what you did 
 hold on a second 
 you said you are gonna call me up you didnt call me up who do you think you are who do you think you are 
 its completely done on a contingency basis that means whatever the settlement is i retain onethird that is of course the usual arrangement 
 what is this going to cost 
 we just 
 i completely understand 
 we told them we didnt want it to come out this way 
 i doubt we will have to go to trial 
 the archdiocese called up they said who was our attorney cause the case is coming to trial 
 i was telling your wife we have a very good case here 
 thats all right 
 please sit down i told your wife im sorry that we have to meet out here i have got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers 
 its a common medical term 
 code blue 
 then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men to help a girl whose lifes not going to be changed in the least you know what code blue means 
 actually yes its by no means bad i 
 she getting good care over there 
 i made a detailed physical examination of the patient sir yesterday evening i 
 easthampton hospital for women excuse me what is that a joke let me tell you something doctor those men at catherine laboure men who are known not only in this city but the world were trying to save a womans life they were there and here you are four years later read some hospital report and say 
 i am on the staff of 
 what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics 
 i am seventyfour years old 
 is that what a good doctor would do how old are you please 
 she went in complaining of stomach cramps good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart 
 thats what the sister said the chart said she ate nine hours prior to 
 her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittanceshe 
 why is that 
 they gave her the wrong anesthetic 
 ium 
 the doctors were not negligent 
 igiven the limits of your question thats correct 
 then you are saying theres no negligence based on my question 
 iin that small context i would havei would have to say no 
 well 
 are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice 
 no no thank you you go home 
 you sure you dont want me to stay on 
 yesiyes 
 you knowsometimes people can surprise you sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth 
 no no thank you doctor you go home 
 im afraid thats not true will you want me to stay on till monday 
 no you did fine 
 i didnt do too well for you 
 its my opinion it took him much longer nineten minutes theres too much brain damage 
 now dr towlers testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes in your opinion is his estimate correct 
 cardiac arrest during delivery her heart stopped when the heart stops the brains deprived of oxygen you get brain damage that is why shes in the state shes in today 
 dr thompson from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventysix in your opinion what happened to deborah ann kaye 
 theres nothing they can do to me 
 these people play very rough they dont want to lose this case theres a lot of pressure they can bring to bear i 
 what difference would 
 apartment no no please you dont know who we are dealing with i please believe me they 
 i made a reservation at 
 yes yes i think so i hope you will be comfortable im putting you up at my 
 from what i have seen mr galvin you have a very good case 
 im going to take you to the home to see the girl 
 thats what id planned to 
 i have some errands to run and then i thought wed spend the evening 
 it was good of you to meet 
 dr thompson 
 thank you 
 negligent yesit would have been criminal but that was not the case 
 if she had eaten say one hour prior to admission the inducement of a general anaestheticthe type you gave her would have been negligent 
 she threw up in her mask yes but she hadnt eaten one hour prior to admission 
 page N if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask is that what happened to deborah ann kaye she aspirated into her mask 
 yes 
 and you wrote that 
 i yes it is 
 practice and methodology in anaesthesia general textbook on the subject is that correct 
 yes i wrote it 
 dr towler page N contraindications to general anaesthetic ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic does that sound familiar 
 to do right isnt that why you are doing it 
 uh why why are you doing this 
 thats perfectly all right 
 thank you 
 the case with anyone and i will meet you tuesday and we will go over your testimony 
 i understand 
 we have to we we have to keep you under wraps please dont dont discuss 
 okay i will meet you here tuesday night i gotta go you going my way

 what are they going to do not invite me to their birthday party look i gotta go i have to be in cambridge 
 the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of 
 whose side are you arguing i thought that you wanted to do something i dont have any interest in the womans estate no offense but we all know where the moneys going to i have an interest in the hospital and i dont want those bozos working in the same shop as me they gave her the wrong anesthetic they turned the girl into a vegetable they killed her and they killed her kid you caught em now how many others did they kill 
 the most respected 
 i read the file yeah marx and towler i know who they were 
 do you know who her doctors were 
 her doctors murdered her they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life her doctors murdered her 
 im sorry 
 her doctors killed her 
 uh in the well in the interests of her family you dr gruber you know you can never tell what a jury is going to do st catherines a very well thought of institution her doctors 
 why 
 yes 
 you are going to settle out of court 
 yes 
 and you are going to do that 
 the archdiocese called they want to settle her estate 
 right who called 
 they called they are going to settle what i want to do is build up as much 
 deborah ann kaye 
 deborah ann kaye 
 i read the hospital report on your client 
 thats perfectly all right im kind of rushed do you mind if we walk while we talk 
 i appreciatea man as busy as 
 yes galvin right 
 dr gruber 
 well maybe you better do that then you know you guys are all the same you dont care who gets hurt you are a bunch of whores youd do anything for a dollar you got no loyaltyno nothingyou are a bunch of whores 
 you think im pushy now wait til i get you on the stand 
 you know you are pushy fella 
 then why dont you testify 
 i dont owe them a goddamn thing 
 i do who is it the doctors what do you owe them 
 who says that im protecting anyone 
 who are you protecting then 
 i didnt do it mister 
 who put my client in the hospital for life 
 and ask me what 
 i can subpoena you you know i can get you up there on the stand 
 then why arent you testifying for their side 
 nothing happened 
 you know what happened 
 i have got nothing to say to you

 another frank 
 because she was anemic its right there on her chart her brain was getting less oxygen anyway 
 huh and why is that 
 yes 
 wait wait wait you are saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes 
 brain damage could have beenit didnt necessarily take nine minutes it could have been caused in two 
 why did it take that long to get her heartbeat 
 wed gone to code blue we were administering electro 
 what happened in those three minutes 
 we were trying to restore her heartbeat 
 what happened in those three 
 we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes we were trying to restore her 
 they start again three minutes earlier 
 as i have said we had some more 
 fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped and they resume seven minutes 
 we we were rather busy 
 but those notations stop fourandonehalf minutes after deborah ann kayes 
 yes the roving nurse 
 of the procedures 
 yes 
 there are notations every thirty seconds 
 yes thats correct 
 you have a record of what happened in the operating room 
 yes 
 dr towler 
 okay now so hes in jail he finally he gets to see the light he calls up harrington he says he thinks he made a mistake as if by magic charges against him are dropped hes released from jail ps hes fired from the firm his wife divorces him he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years you like that story 
 me too 
 before he can get there here comes this federal marshal and frankys indicted for jury tampering they throw him in jail hes gonna be disbarred his life is over jimmy gimme another drink how are you 
 huh 
 that frank was working on yeah he thought franky needed some help so they bribed a juror so franky finds out he comes to me in tears he thinks that anybody who knows what a spinnaker is got to be a saint i told him franky wake up these people are sharks what do you think they got so rich from doing good he cant be comforted he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they have disappointed him hes going to the judge to rat them out 
 the big boy did 
 and hes making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns harrington and he bought a dog and everything is rosy then mr stearns he tried to fix a case 
 yes 
 a huge law firm okay they put him in the firm hes married everythings superb franky hes starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire some fuckin place you must drop by with pat and me okay 
 should i 
 stearns harrington you know who that is 
 so far you are great you got a cigarette 
 howm i doing so far 
 franky cant make it he had an appointment he forgot hes going to see you later im mickey morrissey we are supposed to get to know each other 
 i will give you another complication he still is 
 ah that complicates the problem 
 i can give you one thing he was in love with her 
 no we have ways of digging out knowledge but it takes longer he is suffering from acute melancholia together with a guilt complex he blames himself for what happened to the woman and we know little of the background 
 he wont talk 
 it is hard to say six months at least perhaps a year it depends to a certain extent on him 
 doctor how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this 
 no theres nothing you have to say to me im getting out scottie for good i cant stay here im winding up her affairs and mine im going to get as far away as i can probably europe and i will probably never come back goodbye scottie if theres anything i can do for you before i go 
 i i 
 he had no right to say that it was my responsibility you didnt know her i shouldnt have got you involved 
 natural fear her grandmother went insane and took her own life and the blood is in madeleine scottie i ask you to watch her closely 
 why did she never tell her daughter 
 her mother told me most of then before she died i dug out the rest for myself here 
 how do you know all these things she doesnt know 
 she is not my wife 
 and when she goes to those places 
 nothing 
 knows nothing of a grave out at mission dolores or an old house an eddy street or a portrait at the palace of the legion of honor 
 but she doesnt know about her background she never heard of carlotta valdes 
 well that explains it anyone could develop an obsession for the past with a background like that 
 greatgrandmother the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death was madeleines grandmother 
 carlotta valdes was what your wifes grandmother 
 something else my wife madeleine has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to carlotta she inherited them never wore them they were too oldfashioned until now now when she is alone she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently curiously puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror and goes into that other world is someone else again 
 oh yes you noticed the way she does her hair 
 but you knew about this 
 i didnt know where she was going to lead you 
 there are things you didnt tell me 
 yes 
 thats carlotta valdes 
 you have done well scottie you are good at your job 
 all right you wont know what to look for at first scottie even i who know her so well cannot tell sometimes when the change has begun she looks so lovely and normal 
 ernies 
 we are going to an opening at the opera tonight we will dine at ernies first which is easier 
 how can i see her to know her 
 scottie i need a friend someone i can trust im in a panic about this 
 its not my line 
 i want you 
 i can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you they are dependable good boys 
 yes but carefully id want to know more before committing her to that kind of care scottie 
 have you talked to the doctors at all 
 the speedometer of her car showed she had driven N miles that day where did she go i have to know scottie where she goes and what she does before i got involved with doctors 
 well 
 watched her come out of the apartment someone i didnt know walking in a different way holding her head in a way i didnt know and get into her car and drive out to golden gate park five miles she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore the portals of the past sat there a long time not moving and i had to leave to got to the office that evening when i came home i asked what shed done all day she said shed driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake thats all 
 whered she go 
 more and more in the past few weeks and she wanders god knows where she wanders i followed her one day 
 how often does this happen 
 im not making it up i wouldnt know how she will be talking to me about something nothing at all and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank and she is somewhere else away from me someone i dont know i call to her and she doesnt hear and then with a long sigh she is back and looks at me brightly and doesnt know shes been away cant tell me where or why 
 no 
 no it sounds idiotic i know and you are still the hardheaded scot arent you always were do you think im making it up 
 i didnt mean to be that rough 
 then you are of no use to me im sorry i wasted your time thank you for coming in scottie 
 id say youd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist psychologist neurologist psychoanalyst or plain family doctor and have him check you both 
 if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife what would you say 
 no 
 scottie do you believe that someone out of the past someone dead can enter and take possession of a living being 
 someone dead 
 from whom 
 im afraid some harm may come to her 
 then 
 not what you think we are very happily married 
 no no thanks a bit early in the day for spirits well i guess that about covers everything doesnt it i never married i dont see much of the old college gang im a retired detective and you are in the shipbuilding business whats on your mind gavin

 here with you 
 i stood alone on the green searching for something and i started to walk to the church but then the darkness closed in i was alone in the dark being pulled into darkness and i fought to wake up 
 go on with your dream what was it that frightened you 
 no never i have never been there scottie what is it i have never been there 
 madeleine a hundred miles south of san francisco theres an old spanish mission mission san juan bautista its been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum now think hard darling you have been there before you have seen it 
 no never 
 you have been there before you have seen it 
 its all there its no dream 
 yes but 
 and an old wooden hotel of the old california days and a saloon dark lowceilinged with hanging oil lamps 
 at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner 
 go on 
 there was a village square a green with trees and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister across the green a big grey wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above a small garden and next to it a livery stable with old carriages lined up inside 
 tell me 
 but clear so very clear for the first time all of it 
 yes 
 it was the tower again and the bell and the old spanish village 
 it was a dream you are awake you are all right now can you tell me

 im here i have got you 
 im not mad im not mad and i dont want to die but theres someone inside me theres a somebody else and she says i must die scottie dont let me go 
 and so explain it away but there is a way to explain it you see if im mad that would explain it wouldnt it 
 if i could find the key find the beginning put it together

 of the woman in the mirror would you know her if you saw her 
 no

 i know 
 how do you know 
 i dont know an open grave i stand by the gravestone looking down into it and its my grave 
 where 
 a grave 
 what else 
 no its in shadow 
 would you know the room 
 a room there is a room and i sit there alone always alone 
 what do you remember 
 vaguely 
 but the small scenes the fragments in the mirror you remember them 
 yesterday 
 there is so little i know it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored and fragments of mirror still hang there dark and shadowy reflecting a dark image of me and yet not me someone else in other clothes of another time doing things i have never done but still me and i cant stop to ask why i must keep on walking at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness and i know when i walk into the darkness i will die but i have never come to the and i have always come back before then except once 
 and you will go on saving me again and again 
 im responsible for you now you know the chinese say that once you have saved someones life you are responsible for it forever and so im committed and i have to know

 franco motherfucking harris 
 tonight we return once again to the cave tonight we let the monsters out we fill ourselves with the spirits of genghis khan joe namath jfk paton lombardi hemingway 
 i dont have to 
 name one 
 multiple reasons 
 oh and why am i an asshole 
 you are an asshole 
 you are an asshole adam 
 boyd brought up divorce statistics 
 no because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about which makes N per cent of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me 
 because my opinion threatens yours its poorly developed 
 its really a stupid opinion you have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak 
 sorry fish 
 you are interrupting a personal conversation 
 no first of all im not in a game mood 
 first of all 
 we are leaving from my house in three hours if you want to come get your numbers in order by then 
 no im not boyd i am not cool at all 
 all right lets all go back in adam you are cool right 
 i got children i have got a life 
 they wont figure it out 
 im talking about dna samples fiber optics search parties they got infrared scanners fbi scientists they figure this shit out they always figure it out 
 it has worked 
 i wont calm down i cant do this we cant do this it wont work it will not work 
 adam calm down 
 i didnt do anything i will turn your pathetic ass in 
 i dont give a damn 
 you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing adam we got a rehearsal situation here 
 nobodys smoking anybody out 
 they are on me they are smoking me out 
 who what are you talking about 
 at the seveneleven 
 what 
 i cant do this 
 what is your problem 
 any time fat boy 
 fuck you boyd 
 watch the tone fella 
 dont talk to me about character 
 lighten up adam show some character 
 would you shush these phones arent secure 
 oh i did i think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play hamburger helper with the hookers head 
 you got us into this mess 
 what does that mean 
 boyd you idiot the shits coming down 
 wrong that is flat out wrong hell is for cowards for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions this is war given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not we have chosen life over death two wrongs dont make a right so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here not less 
 we are all going straight to hell either hell or prison whichever comes first 
 now i am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing its not its not a good thing but it was given the circumstances the smart play we did what had to be done andwellim proud of us im proud of each and every one of us we performed under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations we stood fast and we delivered i feel proud 
 alright lets do it 
 i am not flexible on this 
 we have to get going 
 open the suitcases unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs 
 well what the fuck are we supposed to do 
 that is absolutely not true 
 shes asian they dont have jews in asia 
 no we are not the bodies are all mixed up we cant do this to them 
 so thats what we are doing 
 according to jewish law the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being they must be buried together or their souls wont rest in peace 
 how do you figure 
 no i mean the suitcases we cant bury them in suticases 
 we have already done this 
 we cant do this 
 what 
 wait wait a minute 
 im not wrecking the transmission 
 sun rises at N 
 the reality is you take away the horror of this situation take away the tragedy of the death take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned beaten into your head since grade one what are we left with what a N lb problem N lbs that must be moved from point a to point b now a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line but that line exists and i see iti see that line trust me adam trust mei can take care of this 
 have you ever done this before 
 someone goes to walmart gets some buckets brushes mops spic and span the works 
 what about the blood 
 we check out the area and wait for a time when its clear 
 you dont think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony 
 wrap her up in blankets bring the car around to the back of the hotel throw her off the balcony put her in the cardone 
 shes got bondage burns on her wrists theres blow all over the room moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion this room looks like the manson family stayed here a month micheal goes down we all go down 
 so i didnt fucking do it

 whatever you say kojak

 im talking about some bad bad very bad things bad things those are bad fucking things 
 you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation 
 you have got a warped thought process your brain doesnt function properly 
 my what 
 im getting really tired of your bullshit 
 this is a situation that defies judgement we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most 
 hold on a sec lois you sure you wouldnt rather do this in the morning 
 isnt it a little late 
 thats right 
 now 
 that it was all an accident she wants to hear it from micheals mouth 
 hear what 
 good deal lois just wants to hear it from micheal 
 yeah 
 im talking about lois having relaxed her anxiety only deal isyou still got micheal there 
 what does that mean 
 okay heres the deal and its a good one lois is cool its a pacified situation 
 you got a nasty side to your thought process 
 i dont know 
 and what does that mean are you insane you think i would hurt lois shes the mother of those kids what is wrong with you 
 what does that mean 
 take care of business 
 what are you going to do 
 just do it 
 i dont think thats such a good idea 
 after you drop the kids off take micheal home put a few drinks in him so he will sleep 
 suck my ass 
 jesus boyd you are going to od him 
 no but shes definitely pissed and hostile and shes clearly starting to think thats somethings not right 
 does she sound pissed scared hostile did she mention the police 
 regarding what 
 you want to know what you are doing here you are love pumping you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies you are walking the walk this is it fisher the real stuff you love this woman love is second to nothing i love you i love moore i love micheal this car is full of love and nothing absolutely nothing supersedes love man nothing we will do what it takes whatever it takes 
 whats your point 
 exactly exactly my point 
 i just want to get married 
 what you just said say it again 
 what 
 say it again 
 i dont know i just want to get married 
 yes you did now that is the question that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves you tell me fisher what have we done 
 i said what have we done 
 what is the question you asked me 
 what 
 what did you ask me 
 boydwhat have we done 
 he is not cracking up 
 hes cracked up 
 no easy boyd i got a best friend in there in pieces how about a little sensitivity 
 easy boyd 
 hes having a problem here 
 negative this is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior 
 shut up boyd 
 ok definitely not cool definitely inappropriate behavior here 
 no the problem as i recall was the lack of blocking 
 the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left 
 you always were a jealous man 
 fisher had a less than normal relationship with that donkey 
 however it goes the point is nobody says anything to anyone ever right right 
 it goes today is the first day of the rest of our lives 
 no this is the perfect time this is real time adam your brother and i as well as several others present have always suspected that you are a fully repressed living in major denial locked down flyboy buttfucker 
 micheal now is probably not the best time for this 
 go ahead 
 im talking about prayer 
 what kind of words 
 i think we should say some words over the grave 
 that is a load of shit personal power has nothing to do with any of this tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly yes but to give him credit for this for all of thiswell thats just more than the man deserves 
 so help me god you touch that phone and i bury you with them surrender is no longer an option i repeat it is not an option is there anyone who does not understand that 
 im calling the police 
 all right people new plan not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan 
 good godgood god 
 nobody knows shes here 
 whats insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girls head through a toilet thats insane 
 oh god this is insane 
 nobody knows 
 oh for christsake boyd somebody must know shes here 
 well we can definitely call the police thats an easy call if we call the policewhat happens they find a dead prostitute in the bathroomthey ask uswhat happened we say ahour friend micheal your brothergot a little out of controlthey were making loveand he got a little excitedand he ah sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet while he choked her to death with a rubber hose

 thats what im saying let the israelis straighten it up they got plenty of room down there number one plus and this is just a plus they kind of look alike the jews and the mexicans so i think on a whole your average joe mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing am i right 
 they need leadership 
 the mexicans would love it they are dying for a little order down there they need direction 
 lock up the chickens dig up the holy dirt pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long stick it all on a big fucking tug boat the whole country picks up and takes mexico

 the israelis can protect themselves they got the mossad thing happening mossads for real man they scalp babies 
 now if im the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know its just a matter of time right am i right 
 whats your point 
 i say to myself look at the map look whats all around you people who wish bad bad things for you and your people for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody it used to be theyd throw rocks then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears then the gunpowder revolution now they are shooting fire power back and forth all day bullets flying babies getting shot 
 they have a president a benjamin yahoo something 
 then what do they have 
 israel doesnt have a king 
 if im the king of israel i say to myself king i say to myself king take a good look around what do i see

 so you didnt come from the poorhouse 
 when i wasnt so miserable i used to sell pigs begging your pardon i was more honest than my holy mother 
 then its a respectable house 
 lots its got balconies and two big towers 
 are there many windows 
 two 
 so much the better we will all fit how many floors are there 
 then you wont forgive me 
 you disgust me even if what you say is true 
 all that i said just now was a lie i said it so you wouldnt leave i only molested you in my thoughts i cant bear to have you leave me hating me like this tell me you believe what im saying and i will let you go 
 i have listened to you long enough let me out 
 you must listen to me before you go 
 let me pass 
 go away leave me alone 
 think about it dont hurry think it over 
 no its true last night when you were sleeping i had you all to myself 
 you are lying 
 dont go 
 leave us alone ramona 
 you must be out of your mind i have been so happy these last few days now you have spoiled it all 
 yes i dont want you ever to leave this house 
 maybe 
 its my fault if id come to see you more often if id invited you here for holidays maybe everything would be different 
 unfortunately 
 its up to you entirely dont leave then 
 uncle you mustnt think that i wont be sad to leave you 
 no it isnt that i can assure you i wouldnt be afraid in the face of real danger i have proved that to myself on the other hand if a stranger visited me simply to say hello id be alarmed 
 wasnt that cowardice 
 if you only knew when i was young i was full of idealism i wanted to do something on a big scale for others something to show my great love for humanity but as soon as i tried to do something about it i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool and so i went back into my shell 
 no uncle and now im pleased to have been able to do this favor because although i didnt think so at first you are really a good man 
 you must think im mad 
 i dont like masquerading but as you see i decided to give in to your whim 
 how strange you are when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused you seemed almost offended and now here you are making me so very happy all of a sudden thank you my child 
 today i can refuse you nothing 
 i should like you to do something for me its an innocent sort of thing but im very set on it 
 whatever you like 
 this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell 
 thank you uncle 
 if you like i will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave 
 then its penance for you who are going to be a nun and for me who am old its death 
 no uncle ashes mean penance and death 
 no but what a pity life is like that 
 you must think i am a monster 
 dont worry he wont be forgotten 
 and this innocent child 
 his mother wanted to keep him she came from a poor family i was in love with your aunt i would like to have acknowledged him but i was afraid of losing her thats why i didnt say anything 
 and what do you know about life when all is said and done you couldnt possibly understand 
 evil 
 sometimes these things happen because of inexperience sometimes its because of 
 how could anybody behave like that 
 never 
 dont you ever see him 
 yes it is 
 oh some years ago i heard my mother talking about it but is it true 
 how did you know about that 
 nothing i didnt say anything 
 what do you mean 
 only because you want it 
 you are spoiling me too much i wont know what to do with myself when you have gone 
 im going to make you a nuns cake it will make your mouth water 
 you see even the voice 
 i know uncle you have told me that already 
 how like your aunt you are even in your walk 
 come down 
 my maid ramonas daughter shes a little animal 
 who is she 
 come down here you scamp 
 in twenty years the grass has invaded everything there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor i hardly ever go out 
 you have been neglecting the farm uncle 
 no 
 you have no feelings toward 
 to tell you the truth not very much i cannot lie i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially but otherwise 
 did you have so little interest in seeing me 
 no mother superior told me to come 
 was that difficult to get 
 a very short while uncle i have been given permission to stay only a few days 
 how long are you staying 
 you will think you are still at the convent 
 excellent what a charming peaceful place uncle 
 im well the bus was late wasnt it what was the journey like 
 yes uncle how are you 
 its only that its all very odd sir 
 dont lie you dont believe me either 
 yes sir 
 you believe me dont you 
 tell her i lied that i didnt take advantage of her 
 but what can i say to her sir 
 what for she will only look at me that way again i couldnt you go perhaps she will listen to you try to convince her 
 speak to her again explain everything to her seriously 
 the way she looked at me ramona she hates me now i think i have made a great mistake shes going away shes going away and nothing will stop her 
 but sir what can i say to her and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her 
 why dont you speak to her ramona women are good at that sort of thing think of something that will make her stay a few more days you are kind ramona speak to her i know i dont need to offer you anything but if you are successful in this i will not forget you or your little girl 
 just say the word sir and i will do anything 
 yes yes but theres no need to bring that up how far are you prepared to help me 
 id be really ungrateful if i didnt like you sir you took me and my little girl in when i didnt know where to turn 
 sit down woman sit down you like me dont you 
 whats the matter 
 sit down im going to need your help 
 i have asked her but shes ungrateful sometimes i feel like hitting her when i talk to her about the convent she turns to stone 
 why dont you ask her to stay on for a few days 
 yes sir good night 
 leave me now you can go to bed 
 i didnt want to do it don jorge they made me 
 they told us youd be back tomorrow 
 enedinas going to take a picture so we will have a souvenir

 she wont even know 
 what will the lady say 
 tonight but i will be back tomorrow afternoon 
 no sir its nearly six oclock okay lets get a move on when are you leaving 
 hold on ramon is there time to make another trip 
 thats good land 
 and in the vegetable plot 
 its for wheat we have always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables 
 the fields have been left so long with a good manuring anything will grow 
 have you thought of what you want planted yet 
 good 
 thats it 
 thats fifteen by seven 
 fifteen yards 
 how much is that 
 quiet my dove quiet or i will 
 ramona ramona 
 but why why 
 he was asking for it 
 my god what have you done to him 
 that doesnt matter i like it 
 thank you but its missing something 
 its very good 
 do you have great devotion for the virgin 
 it wont take but a minute its a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever our lady of the helpless granted her a favor 
 come on miss just so the virgin can be really pretty 
 me 
 thats life some people are brought together others are separated what can we do if thats the way it happens 
 you see how much you like her 
 dont be a fool why rush away from something which couldnt happen 
 i think id better go tomorrow 
 how in hell does it wind up 
 it doesnt make any difference what she is you like her 
 she isnt my cousin 
 that your cousin is more to your taste 
 what are you thinking about 
 you should have enough to do in this house come here and listen to this 
 im bored im alone all day and i dont know what to do 
 shouldnt i be you on the other hand 
 you are happy arent you 
 what i do every day but i want to do it earlier 
 what are you going to do 
 if you wake first wake me up 
 run and get something to mop it up with quickly 
 so ramona 
 let her do what she wants she doesnt bother us in any way she minds her business and we 
 no not mad at all shes rotten with religion 
 shes mad 
 its viridiana shes getting on my nerves 
 why the bad temper 
 nothing 
 whats the matter with you 
 why do you say that perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous 
 not in that way you are always looking for company 
 that will teach you not to bother me any more you son of a bitch 
 kill him 
 kill him and i will tell you if i dont keep my word you can kill me too there are thousands of pesetas kill him idiot 
 wheres the dough 
 i dont want you to untie me kill him and then i will give you the money 
 theres plenty of money in this house piles of it 
 me rich come on 
 if you free me you will be a rich man 
 maybe afterwards he will let me 
 thats stupid plaster it can still be used 
 i dont know they have always been there 
 these chairs are in good condition with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable 
 you wouldnt be here otherwise 
 why 
 i dont know i cant remember but im sure he loved you 
 there are some curtains and drapes but they are all very old 
 and this chest 
 one shouldnt be alone the whole time im not like him am i 
 i dont know sir 
 why did he kill himself 
 he was very good better than some people would think 
 why 
 no

 dont worry nobodys going to disturb you 
 are they going to work here too 
 im not sure yet i have had a shock recently and im only beginning to get over it perhaps i will go back to the convent one day 
 is that all you are going to devote your life to 
 i know perfectly well how little i can do what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof some food and a bit of human warmth 
 theres no point in helping some of them when there are so many others 
 they worry me a great deal and especially because of you 
 do they worry you that much then 
 you wont get much done with those people those times are over you ought to let me kick them out 
 leave him alone 
 what are you doing here get out 
 im not like you you have your wife 
 i dont understand how you can like being alone so much 
 and do you know that my mother and i had to suffer if my father had bothered himself a little more about us id be an architect now 
 i know that you used to work with an architect 
 what do you know about me 
 im not interested do what you thinks best 
 but you have a right to let us know what you think 
 i dont know anything about these things jorge 
 if i wait until tomorrow it will be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days when you are not with your poor people you are praying or you disappear i never see you 
 well is it so urgent 
 its about time we spoke to each other isnt it 
 jorge you frightened me whats happening to you 
 i have been expecting you i got a letter from the lawyer 
 jorge don jaimes son at your service 
 are you jorge 
 miss viridiana 
 canelo 
 whats he called 
 and remember the less he eats the better he runs 
 i wasnt thinking of selling him but if you want i will leave it to you 
 how much do you want for him 
 hes good at rabbiting and he knows it when we are in the country if he doesnt hunt he doesnt get fed 
 and let him get run over by somebody else 
 then let him go and he will follow you 
 its for people 
 hes lying through his ass 
 stop this 
 you will soon find out you liar 
 right i wont say that but i still think they are no use 
 dont say that 
 parents nobody cares a damn whats the use of them 
 are your parents alive 
 hold your arm out you cant hope to be cured quickly you heard what the doctor said if it had been seen to in time this will take time but with the help of god we will pull through 
 things seem to be getting better 
 how are you today 
 i will take him to the doctor tomorrow come on now sit down and go on eating and you look after him as if he were a sick brother be understanding now finish eating and then go to bed everyone in bed by eight oclock 
 they are varicose veins it isnt leprosy

 they are varicose veins miss but some days i cant take care of them 
 come with me 
 where 
 theres been an accident 
 why not 
 you cannot leave 
 is anything the matter mr mayor 
 how do you do miss viridiana 
 don jaime loved to watch me skip 
 i will box your ears if you dont show some respect for the dead you mustnt play under this tree 
 you little liar get out of here 
 he came in through the cupboard 
 he couldnt get through the door then 
 yes very very big 
 very very 
 its a very big one 
 a black bull 
 a black bull came 
 dont invent stories go to bed 
 im afraid 
 why are you crying 
 i cant do anything to make you stay these people annoy you isnt that it 
 yes 
 you have decided to leave moncho 
 but miss 
 in you go moncho lead the way you stay here 
 this louse is looking for trouble 
 whats going on moncho 
 they shut all right now and the blankets are ready 
 have you repaired the windows of the dormitories 
 you are forgiven goodbye 
 forgive me if i have offended you 
 are you aware of the pride there is in what you are saying 
 i have nothing to reproach myself for all i know is that i have changed with all my strength which is not much i will follow the road that the lord has shown me one can also serve outside a convent 
 is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows there must be something 
 a suicide is horrible i know but you should have told me 
 i had so many things to think about 
 ever since yesterday when we heard by chance about the tragedy we have been very anxious for you why didnt you write i would have come immediately 
 mother 
 good morning you werent expecting me were you 
 the retreat will start soon you can leave tomorrow morning 
 i have no desire to see the world again but if you order me to 
 he has paid for your studies and your maintenance and he has just sent your dowry does that mean so little to you viridiana 
 but why does he want to see me he has never bothered about me 
 im afraid that his health is not good hes your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows you will certainly never see him again 
 i dont want to leave the convent mother 
 in any case hes asking you to come and stay with him 
 i hardly know him i saw him only once some years ago i cant even remember him 
 all right mother 
 i have just had a letter from your uncle he wont be able to come when you take your vows 
 mother 
 if you want to stay you will have to exercise a little selfcontrol and be a bit more humble to everybody 
 i have had a gutful of this 
 would you mind telling me what i did wrong to you to deserve your insults 
 i will talk the way i want to i have had enough of this 
 dont talk like that 
 good then lets go 
 when you are miss 
 give the little girl to me come here sweetheart are you ready 
 thats enough go join the others and dont come back here and you will have to control your temper 
 ask the priest miss 
 dont pay any attention to him its very good 
 she looks like a sick marrow 
 thats all right we all laugh here but not at you i will see to that 
 im only good at making people laugh 
 what about you manuel 
 right lets go and keep the compliments to yourself i dont like them 
 she has the face of an angel what a pity you cant see her 
 oh you slept well dont worry 
 have i slept long 
 you fainted last night after supper the master and i carried you here 
 what happened to me 
 that will soon pass its nothing 
 i have a headache 
 how do you feel 
 ah pleased to meet you 
 welcome miss im ramona don jaimes servant 
 no i dont want to 
 im going to the hen house are you coming with me 
 its very wicked to spy why did you do it 
 from the terrace 
 how did you see me 
 yes yes i saw you 
 what 
 could i trouble you for my glass of milk 
 today a good girl 
 good morning rita how are we today 
 hello 
 hello 
 jesus christ i know who the dominant personality is lindenmeyer 
 i have discovered something about lindenmeyerN maestro teaching tool i thought you should know the harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it 
 im sorry i thought you were somebody else 
 me what did i do 
 you sonofabitch im going to kill you 
 look i feel bad about this so im going to try to look into the programming of his maestro teaching tool for you i have had one sitting around for years maybe i can learn something that you will find useful 
 its not your fault we appreciate you trying 
 it was very wellhidden there was no way to see it until it was too late 
 i accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program 
 in english please 
 there is one program with approximately N million lines of programming it is thoroughly secured which is not surprising considering lindenmeyer created it 
 can you tell us whats on the disc 
 daryl lindenmeyer was only here briefly one semester at most but he was singularly the most brilliant student i ever had in a classroom he created programs so beautiful so lyrical they were almost like symphonies 
 you already have staked your reputation mayor bennett and i have been friends a long time since grimes tried to kill him it doesnt take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that sid N might go after him too bennetts reelection rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose the failsafe online yet 
 do i need to remind you what happened to his wife to his daughter i will stake my reputation that barnes didnt kill those guards 
 he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room but not two prison guards 
 barnes wouldnt kill two innocent guards 
 i wish we could hear them 
 i dont know 
 why would they be going there 
 madison lives two blocks from their present location 
 what are they doing in los feliz 
 but only you will know hes not human 
 theres already a task force out looking for lindenmeyer every other officer in the city will be hunting sid right along with you 
 yes or no mr barnes 
 if you try to run i will hunt you down and kill you myself 
 this is the newest technology approved for general implementation its called a locater implant every parolee gets one we are going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life 
 catch him and your records clean 
 recognize this how would you like your old job back 
 whatever 
 you mean a nanotech synthetic organism 
 we dont know how but sid N made himself into an android 
 why wasnt i told 
 my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate 
 if you are lying i will hunt you down and kill you myself 
 on my life i promise you i will 
 when this is over will you get this goddam thing out of my head 
 then i guess we are even 
 she saved your life parker she didnt have to but she did 
 you sonofabitch how could you let them put the implant in my head how 
 dont worry they have no idea where you are 
 wheres my gun 
 sid N is now armed 
 their weapons missing 
 officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couplecompletely gutted so were the first two cops to arrive on scene 
 fine  you want to stay here 
 she wasnt part of the deal cox 
 this is the personnel file on the programmer lindenmeyer there might be something in it you can use 
 what shes going to do is get in my way 
 shes going to help you understand what makes sid N tick 
 if you can catch him 
 jesus christ can you kill it 
 name was clyde reilly hardware specialist letac surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building 
 i have seen worse 
 these were taken inside letac an hour ago pretty pictures arent they 
 its too early in the morning for me to be cordial you got any coffee 
 parker barnes id like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane 
 you are wasting your time im not going to play any more of your goddam games 
 do me a favor  keep sending them 
 what about them 
 you know those cheesy christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year 
 dont give up parker not ever 
 but with the six months off i get for being your guinea pig i have only got to survive another N years N months and N days 
 im getting by 
 before you nobody else had gotten close enough to sid N to take a shot at him hell nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first new scar  you making it okay in there 
 real my ass its an overblown game anybody ever catch that fucking psycho 
 you were supposed to act as if everything was real 
 he was a computer program for crissake 
 what the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for 
 donley started experiencing the attack for real if i hadnt gotten you out the same thing would have happened to you you may not believe this parker 
 whyd you pull me out 
 you all right 
 got it 
 give me N seconds then flip every switch you can reach 
 i dont set policy you have the key 
 why didnt anybody tell me 
 i need your help 
 i think we both know who did whats so urgent 
 there is no way parker killed those guards no way 
 captain im afraid of how smart sid N is but im even more afraid of whats hes becoming 
 you think hes smart 
 im not sure my guess is thats what sid wants us to think 
 dont blame yourself in your shoes i dont think i would have told parker either so do you think grimes has become the dominant personality 
 i should have told him 
 in other words we collectively dont know shit 
 until we know what new influences are affecting him we cant be sure 
 none he could be hiding he could be helping sid or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach any idea what sids going to do next 
 any sign of lindenmeyer 
 illegal search of lindenmeyer s duplex eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed twentyfour citizen complaints and the calls are just starting to come in i forgot what its like to have you on the streets 
 i understand the risks involved here but there is nobody better qualified to go after sid N than barnes and there is nobody who knows him better than you if a situation becomes volatile you will find a way to quell it i have complete confidence in you 
 the man played judge jury and executioner with eight peoples lives he lost control and is capable of doing it again 
 not if you are with him every step of the way 
 letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse at some point he will go off you saw what happened in the simulator the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous 
 thats also where mr barnes lost his arms to mathew grimes booby trap whats your point dr carter 
 you are going to put your theories to practice im sending you into the field 
 whats the assignment 
 we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology under the authority vested in me by the president im giving you temporary reassignment 
 ms deane you wanted to see me 
 dont forget convict if this psycho isnt stopped you go right back to rotting in a prison cell 
 or what you will authorize my death a second time today 
 this better not be a wild goose chase 
 you are the highest law enforcement official in the country use the fucking army if you need to 
 you know how much man power you are talking about 
 sid is smart enough to know youd check everywhere in the immediate area whatever the device is hes probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates have the demo teams check every subway tunnel water pipe gas pipe and sewer pipe that goes under over or into the arena 
 demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel i dont know where 
 if i were you id get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the biltmore hotel 
 enough to level an entire city block 
 no but i have confirmed the reelection rally is the target how much cN is missing 
 its already been called off witnesses confirmed you werent the shooter did you find out where the bomb is 
 call off the manhunt looking for me i didnt kill the transport guards 
 what did you find out 
 trying to find out where the bomb is where the hell have you been 
 barnes where the hell have you been 
 how do you know i wont run 
 if sid N hasnt killed you we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence 
 what happens if i cant catch him 
 this is a full pardon it authorizes your immediate release 
 not from in here 
 think you can do it 
 nobody else ever got anywhere near him nobody else understands him like you do 
 only because i got pulled out early 
 i watched your simulation mr barnes very impressive you know you are the only one to ever go up against sid N who is still alive 
 neither will the public the media has caught wind of his pardon unless mr barnes starts giving me some tangible results im going to put him back in his cage 
 it makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform i will never forget the first time i saw the photos from the crime scene 
 i was assured the problem was corrected 
 simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world 
 lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system if the simulator isnt calibrated properly experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream the experience becomes real 
 what the hell happened 
 dont remind me 
 barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field remember 
 what did cox pull him out early for 
 as a matter of fact i do 
 he hearseverything 
 how does he know who i am 
 i understand i understand perfectly 
 you are to turn over the sid N program and all its documentation for immediate destruction is that understood 
 im what 
 you have had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want lindenmeyer elizabeth deane does not give second chances neither do i you are fired 
 im still making adjustments 
 of the six prison inmates you have tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training  only mr barnes is still breathing 
 the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism 
 you embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country do you have any idea how much money you just cost me 
 what i need is a nymphomaniac 
 you need a maid 
 i know im ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile if you want to experience the future meet me in my office in N minutes and bring the sheila N character module with you 
 amazing i hate to say it but it is 
 and you get nanodeath dont worry i have got a bunch of other ones 
 separate the character module from the neural net 
 how do you kill it 
 as far as the public is concerned it is the reason you got fired and i got my second demo into production is im a lot smarter than you i never give my best stuff away 
 this is supposed to be years away 
 its better than real its synthetic flesh synthetic blood synthetic organs its a physiological machine 
 it feels so real 
 coordinated by polymer neural net 
 its nanotechnology isnt it machines the size of molecules 
 watching your vr people auto reset gave me the idea 
 you aresuch a wimp 
 get that fucking thing away from me 
 bastard sheila dont go anywhere i will be right back 
 do i get to see it or not 
 i havent been working on anything 
 shows over unless i get to see what you have been working on after hours 
 hey 
 then fix it 
 if i dont adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving he wont be able to walk when i take him out of vr 
 talk so i can understand 
 hes developing a hemisphere imbalance 
 turn it down 
 i wonder how that 
 show me his physical sensory level 
 how should i know 
 whats wrong with parker 
 i told you this would work by setting back the clocks he has absolutely no idea hes in virtual reality he still thinks hes in the real world 
 dont worry through me you will live forever 
 im begging youplease dont kill me please 
 you made me a composite of N of the most vicious people who ever lived what do you think im doing 
 glad to 
 help me get out of here 
 how can i ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time daryl 
 of course you are 
 i am beautiful arent i 
 what do you expect me to do thank him 
 sid  no 
 i think i understand what you have in mind 
 you catching my drift 
 all my work is my finest 
 shes some of your finest work daryl 
 i had something a little different in mind instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly why dont you get him to show you what hes been working on after hours 
 what do you expect me to do put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here 
 which god would that be the one who created me or the one who created you in your world the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but in my world the one who gave me life doesnt have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away 
 my god 
 i couldnt just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty im a tripletwisting double back flip off the high platform not a swan dive 
 you amped the neural connectors back up didnt you you are the reason the convict died you are the reason i got fired 
 it was me what 
 it was you wasnt it 
 true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime 
 all they want to produce around here is mediocrity 
 think hard it will come to you 
 should i have 
 did you recognize the sonofa bitch who got away 
 dont be angry with me daryl 
 you wont want to watch turn around 
 what do we do now 
 duck 
 then shoot him already 
 i couldnt tell you 
 hows your pulse 
 lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had 
 where the hell are you going 
 i dont know 
 sid 
 my guess is dead 
 lindenmeyer 
 more or less 
 i think soyou 
 you okay 
 because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what im capable of and what im not and better than anyone else i am capable of stopping sid N 
 thats why im asking 
 you dont know 
 you have already fulfilled the terms of your pardon you stopped sid N and you have got his module you are free to go  right now why are you going to do this 
 you mean theres something you havent asked me 
 can i ask you something 
 a bombs going off tomorrow night but i have no idea where 
 find out anything 
 thanks 
 nice work 
 im not sureon the bridgethe guy at the payphone 
 see something 
 that or living through him 
 think hes keeping track of his creation 
 if we find sid lindenmeyer wont be far behind 
 part of him is 
 sid N isnt grimes 
 i told you before grimes liked to be obvious 
 the rallys a little obvious as a target dont you think 
 i was wrong and i was wrong not to tell you grimes was part of sid i should have told you i wont make the same mistake again 
 i pose an unacceptable danger to the public remember 
 you are not capable of it 
 sid N told me after he killed the two guards he suggested i kill you rather than him 
 how did you find out about the toxin 
 you knew the entire time can you give me one good reason why i shouldnt kill you right now 
 he didnt know about the neural toxin i did 
 they are going to fry me for it anyway 
 we know you didnt kill those guards 
 no grimes isnt back hes only one part of sid sid N is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was get a hold of yourself 
 grimes is back hes back hes come back 
 if you are gonna do it better do it now 
 parker  stop stop dont make me shoot you 
 both 
 which way 
 authority still makes me nervous 
 you could have just flashed him your badge you know 
 real effective security 
 you like baseball 
 its not just sid N s performances that are increasing stars need bigger and bigger audiences whatever sid is going to do next its going to involve media 
 i dont know yet what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale not decreasing whatever it is he isnt finished 
 start of what 
 whatever he was doing here was only the start 
 im doing the best i can 
 whats the problem 
 tell him 
 this isnt a game parker 
 you know i am 
 enjoying yourself 
 being on the streets a little different than sitting in an office all day isnt it 
 nothing 
 what did you do to those people 
 this is my area of expertise 
 what the hells going on 
 stop me 
 dont get out of the car 
 then why dont you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while 
 i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them 
 relax i know what you meant 
 dammit i hate sounding so clinical all the time all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well but then i 
 dont worry about it all right 
 you know considering you have only been out of prison for seven hours you are readapting quite well wait i didnt mean that the way it sounded i meant 
 i forgot what real coffee tastes like 
 then all we can do is stay mobile and alert hes got to make a move sometime and we have got to be ready when he does welcome to police work you better like coffee 
 what i do know is that whatever hes becoming sid N is going to be even worse than he was before 
 sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next 
 now that hes in the real world there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality sid is going to evolve 
 what does that mean 
 sid N is no longer bound by his programming 
 you should practice lying more often you are awful at it where to 
 i told you it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes 
 want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house 
 thankyou her name is karin 
 shes beautiful you know 
 i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life 
 why didnt you tell me you had a daughter 
 how did you get your hand out 
 told you i wasnt going to go anywhere 
 and im going to make sure of it give me your wrist 
 give me a goddam break im not going to go anywhere alone 
 give me your wrist 
 in order to find him we have to understand what makes him tick 
 what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonofabitch before he kills anybody else 
 dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory we need to get a look at sid N s final profile 
 remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality 
 as a matter of fact it is 
 this is getting you pumped up isnt it this is like the world series to you 
 but rather than selecting pieces from each individual he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones 
 creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts 
 lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain 
 hes part of the mix sid N is a composite 
 hamlet whats david berkowitz got to do with sid N 
 who said that 
 for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ 
 i am impressed 
 here on earth to create havoc and terror i am war i am death i am destruction david berkowitz N 
 i am the demon from the bottomless pit 
 just like they figured there was no better person to catch one 
 the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho 
 i have been in prison remember 
 remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids brains 
 im still working on it 
 im surprised you didnt write one about me 
 maybe after they catch him you should write a book about him 
 this lindenmeyers a real piece of work 
 you have studied me now im studying you seems only fair dont you think 
 checking my pulse its elevated you enjoy frightening me dont you 
 what are you doing 
 do me one favor  if you shoot at anything make sure im nowhere near it 
 you have got a problem with me carrying a gun 
 every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers stay here 
 what happened when he was N 
 he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was N all he did day and night was play the violin 
 learn anything from lindenmeyers file 
 i know who would know 
 i have spent over N hours interviewing him charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate after seeing the blood bath on television he wanted to show them how it should be done the question is what does charlie have to do with sid N 
 charlie you say that like you are close personal friends 
 whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done 
 manson didnt kill the first cops to arrive on the scene 
 he was reenacting charles mansons labianca murders 
 dont worry if i cant handle it i will just kill everybody 
 you ready for this 
 fine never felt better in my life see im a good liar 
 you all right 
 every time i said it it was i never really thought i was going to make it 
 it wasnt a lie 
 every day for the last five years i told myself someday i would be out here again no more bars no more guards no more fights just to stay alive every day for the last five years i told myself that lie 
 what you need is a collar 
 i dont need a babysitter 
 i dont have to do anything except survive and its taking everything i have got just to do that 
 i need to know what snapped in you what made you capable of it you have to make me understand 
 enough 
 it was just like before wasnt it wasnt it but you are making progress instead of killing seven people to get the one you are after this time there was only one other person involved 
 go to hell 
 you didnt see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger but i did you kind of liked it didnt you that thrill of going over the edge again of taking out an innocent bystander or two as long as you got the target 
 not much he was just a computer program nothing more 
 what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy 
 if i had died yesterday youd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence 
 thats not true parker 
 you are not my therapist you are hear to study me face it  im nothing more than a lab rat to you 
 i know i was there i saw the whole thing if i was your therapist i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation 
 john died 
 in other words par for the course how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday 
 a little less than yesterday 
 no i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you how you feeling today 
 you actually listen to all those tapes 
 barnes you are dead 
 now is that any way to talk to an old friend 
 i really did think i was still in reality at least until now beam me up scotty 
 what are you talking about 
 thankyou daryl you had me going for quite a while there sport 
 i have got some final preparations to take care of checking his watch he stops suddenly 
 arent you going to watch with me 
 lets just say im sending a very clear message to his reelection rally 
 you are going after mayor bennett 
 there you go  best seat in the house 
 i thought you liked me being in the audience dont you want me to see it 
 its really too bad you have to miss the grand finale 
 mysecret 
 you cant die until you tell me where the cN is where is it 
 where did you plant the cN 
 let me put it to you this way whether im here or whether im notim leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night

 dead you hear me 
 im sorry the party you are trying to reach is not answering is there anyone else you would like to talk to 
 grimes you are dead 
 now is that any way to talk to an old buddy i mean just because im carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesnt mean we cant be friends 
 youmotherfucker im going to kill you 
 who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands 
 you and me have nothing in common 
 i must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison you know we have so much in common  we have such history together i have been thinking we should become friends 
 the only thing i want to hear is your silence

 and i think that the security of the country would be bestserved by its citizens obeying its laws gemme a federal judge gemme searchwarrants all premises controlled by our friends and benchwarrants for the two of 
 any untoward revelation regarding uh 
 as are we all and id like to take this opportunity to suggest that the security of the country would be ill served by any anyany 
 guess what we show and nsa confirms there are no nuclear devices on the canadian border there are no nuclear devices in albania zat put us in something of a pickle albania has no nuclear capacity our spy satellites show no secret terrorist camps in the albanian hinterland the fbi and the border patrol and the rcmp report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque canadian border the albanian government is screaming its innocence the world is listening there is no war 
 and i take this opportunity to suggest that equally i admit to nothing and that i would like my lawyer present 
 quite touching 
 i was acting as a private citizen nothing that i have done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe i am connected with or in whose employ 
 i know who you are mr ames 
 id like to mention a few names who 
 guess who i am

 obviously 
 the richest one percent of this country owns half the countrys wealth N trillion dollars one third of that comes from hard work two thirds of it comes from inheritance interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do stock and real estate speculation its bullshit ninety percent of the american people have little or no net worth i create nothing i own we make the rules buddy the news war peace famine upheaval the cost of a paper clip we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it you are not naive enough to think we are living in a democracy are you buddy its the free market you are one of us nowtake advantage of it you got the killer instinct kid stick with me i got things to teach you 
 how much is enough gordon 
 buddy its not a question of enough its a zero sum game sport somebody wins and somebody loses money itself isnt lost or made its simply transferred from one perception to another like magic that painting cost $N N years ago i could sell it today for $N the illusion has become real and the more real it becomes the more desperately they want it capitalism at its finest 
 tell me gordonwhen does it all end how many yachts can you waterski behind how much is enough 
 its all about bucks kid the rest is conversation bud you are still going to be president and when the time comes you will parachute out a rich man with the money you are going to make your father wont have to work another day in his life 
 if these people lose their jobs nowhere to go my father worked at bluestar for twentyfour years i gave em my word 
 because its wreckable i took another look and i changed my mind 
 why do you need to wreck this company 
 you are walking around blind without a cane sport a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place 
 maybe you ought to read him pinocchio you told me you were going to turn bluestar around not upside down you used me 
 last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot know what happened he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung 
 i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar why 
 what the hell do you want 
 im sorry this cant wait 
 i didnt know we had a meeting schedule for this morning

 now wait a minute dad 
 a pleasure to meet you mr fox 
 and id like to introduce you to mr gekko and his lawyer mr salt 
 alright susan get buckingham on the box i want him to look at it and tell jock taylor at thwick jensen so sport the falcon has heard the falconertell me more 
 i can talk to these people gordon they trust meand my father can be a big help in getting cuts 
 what makes you think you can 
 the three unions its N per cent of bluestars operating budget the hourly cost of a flight crew is $N an hour thats the real hidden value gg if you can negotiate that out get a crew down to $N an hour a run this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since texas air 
 what does that mean 
 gordon i worked at bluestar i know my way around i have friends thereinside 
 im talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline its gonna take me two years and N headaches to turn teldar paper around what do i need this dink airline for im up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake 
 gordon what i wantand i never asked you for anythingis to be your copilot on this i want to take this airline turn it around and make it work its gonna make us a fortune 
 yeah arent you forgetting something gordon rule one capital reserves this company has $N million cash in an overfunded pension that buys us a lot of credibility and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker 
 mixed emotions buddy like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines fuel could go up unions are killers 
 i think i got some friends that wont mind making some easy money 
 the art of which is deception spread the buy orders through different accounts and you wont get burned 
 close to two million but this sucker can go all the way to devon and the nationals 
 how much 
 got him at an auction in kentucky 
 yeah im gonna make you rich bud fox im gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like darien remember power is the best aphrodisiac this is your wakeup call go to work 
 gordon 
 you dont understand i want to be surprisedastonish me sport new info dont care where or how you get it just get it my wife tells me you put a move on darien heres some inside info for you that euroflash gq guy shes going withs got big bucks but hes putting her feet to sleep exit visas are imminent so dont lose your place in line oh jeez i wish you could see this the lights coming up over the water i have never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment an old russian proverb a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar i like you sport i ever tell you that gordon call me gordon from now on 
 mr gekko im there for you N per cent 
 money never sleeps pal when i came in in N they traded six hours a day now the clock dont stop londons deregulated the orient is hungrier than us just let the money circle the world sport buying and selling and if you are smart it comes back paying i just made $N in hong kong gold its been wired to you play with it you done good but you gotta keep doing good i showed you how the game works now schools out 
 you are learning sport 
 all warfare is based on deception sun tzu says if your enemy is superior evade him if angry irritate him if equally matched fight if not split and reevaluate 
 hes right i had to sell the key to the game is your capital reserves you dont have enough you cant pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs 
 but we dont want to be greedy now so lets let him have it at $N 
 the break up value is higher its worth N 
 stick around larry one of my gang bud fox 
 i guess i will head back 
 allright wait here 
 sorry mr gekko 
 cant it wait im good for it awright come out get the directions from natalie and hurry up

 what about hard work 
 inside information oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline or someone overhears me saying im gonna buy teldar paper or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows its time to blow out xyz you mean that im afraid sport unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company you and i are gonna have a hard time doing any business 
 follow him mr gekko i its not what i do i could lose my license if the sec found out i could go to jail its inside information isnt it 
 wildmans in town he just became an american citizen something bigs about to go down i want to know where he goes and who he sees i want you sport to give me the missing half of the picture 
 i dont understand 
 revenge is a dish best served cold well its payback time sport see that building i bought into it ten years ago it was my first real estate deal i sold it a couple of years later and made an $N dollar profit it was better than sex at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world now its a days pay i had a mole in wildmans employ gave me half the picture then he got fired 
 i remember that deal you were involved

 why 
 hi 
 get the hell out 
 you may not believe this bud but i really do care for you i think we could have made a good teambut thats how it goes 
 im lookingand i sure dont like what i see 
 you are not exactly pure bud you went after gekko with the same vengeance you went after me look in the mirror before 
 you really mean that whatd he promise you to take you public i guess without gordons money and seal of approval im not such a hot investment anymore you are just the best money can buy darien 
 what the hells that supposed to mean 
 im not looking to just survive i have been doing that all my life 
 i can stay with the brokerage firm and you are doing fine we can survive without gordon gekko 
 are you mad why are you doing this we are so close the town is going to be ours dont throw away your future bud 
 at least i wouldnt be pulling the trigger 
 dont cross gordon he will crush you you have worked hard to get where you are if gordon doesnt buy bluestar someone else will and whos to say they wont do the same thing 
 im not gonna let it happen darien 
 buddy its not your fault and its not your decision 
 talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped i handed it to him on a silver platter i told my father and those people 
 im sorry i was afraid something like this could happen 
 fear the fear of being poor i guess just like you darien but thats all gonna change sweetheart im catching the express and you are going along for the ride 
 so did i till i hit N and found i had all the royal habits and no throne mom got by but i had to go to work just like you only the skills i had were shopping and making friends sothats why i do what i do what makes you tick buddy 
 that changes all my plans i thought you were loaded 
 you are so naive bud you dont even know your dad took care of you i might have been rich when i was a kidbut my father lost all his moneyin the seventies in the stock market at the track he was a lousy gambler 
 sure why not moneys the sex of the N s i never had it like you when i was growing up baby it wasnt the upper east side 
 get in bed yever hear of the sixty hour work week you are turning into a yuppie frankenstein you love money so much 
 i love you baby did i tell you that sometime in the last N hours 
 you think im gonna broker the rest of my life im going to be a giant darien an entrepreneur in the italian N th century sense of the word a mover shaker 
 are you going to trade all night again you got to go to work in a couple of hours 
 bud i hate to tell you this but you are a genius darienlightning has struck the lightbulb has been invented edison da vinci einstein are watching 
 i will let you know 
 its not me im worried aboutyou know darien the only reason we havent slept together is because we both know we will and not knowing when was the only surprise left you owe me i want you what else is therebut you me the world right heremake love to menow stop me if im going too far 
 do you think you are ready 
 thats right one with high yield rich assets and no downside 
 you got it all charted out dont you like a stock projection 
 im kidding im kidding we are still young darien so whats money anyway when everybodys making it its all relative after all this is not the house in connecticut this is just a crash pad good for a couple of yearsbefore we slip our two lovely kids yuppie and fruppie into the lycee francaise 
 lets get things straight bud im not going to take a cut i worked hard and you cant decorate a room in new york for less than $N curtains alone 
 sure but your fee considering you are way over budget should be negotiable 
 i will bet hes got an opinion on the stock market too this apartment is already ahead of its time i call it the demolished look they have already heard about it at house and garden and they are coming next week to photograph it before it gets lived in is that alright id love to have it in my portfolio 
 you know the elevator man couldnt believe i paid $N to have my walls looking like this hes got them for free in brooklyn 
 too perfectlets not even eat lets just watch it and think about it 
 isnt it perfect 
 you are not trouble by any chance are you 
 i dont 
 well why stop at that 
 a turner a perfect canary diaiaond a lear jet world peace the best of everything 
 and what do you want 
 you have modest wants i like that in a man 
 the conference oh yeah fine we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us 
 so how did your conference go with gordon 
 yeah almost 
 if i could have anything this would almost do 
 how would i know i once bet a horse he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five 
 hes not a racehorse bud hes a jumper 
 devon he looks like seattle slew what about the triple crown 
 only if i want something bad enough 
 you really do believe in destiny 
 so see you friday 
 you may call me a yuppie its mister yuppie to you 
 i guess this must be destiny alright my first yuppie apartment and my first yuppie 
 break it 
 what if i have a previous engagement 
 oh its just a rental im moving to the east side soon i have got a couple of deals brewing with gordon but thats just conversation what about real things like dinner the two of us friday cafe santo domingo 
 oh really home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant 
 upper west side 
 where is it 
 well if you are that good you could probably do wonders at my place 
 you got it a great spender of other peoples money 
 i gather you are a decorator 
 not really id say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around he has a great eye and he only buys the best like this rug for instance a silk tabriz the finest of its kind the day after he bought it in london a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid it absolutely makes the room see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa although i dont know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery too dingy and its a sacrilege having that precolumbian pot in the center of the coffee table some dope might use it as an ashtray 
 boy i thought gordon was a tough businessman but somebodys really taking him to the cleaners here 
 sure you could in wildwood new jersey if you sold this you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth but you wouldnt have much left over for decoration 
 you could have a great beach house for that 
 oh really well i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june 
 few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me 
 id give anything to have this in my house even for a week 
 stock broker as in never have so few done so little for so much so what do you see in this 
 aha poet or philosopher 
 destiny took us apart but i knew it would bring us back together 
 oh yes i remember you 
 grand marnier a romantic and tragic drink 
 excuse me 
 hello again i been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks 
 oh christ 
 he had a heart attack hon but hes okay hes at the hospital 
 janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps urgent

 how you doing buddy 
 just kickin ass and taking names mr mannheim 
 you are on a roll kiddo enjoy it while it lasts cause it never does 
 its a winner mr mannheim trust me buy 
 cant get a little bit pregnant bud 
 you are right mr mannheim but you gotta get to the big time first then you can be a pillar and do good things 
 no such thing bud cept death and taxes not a good company anymore no fundamentals whats going on bud do you know something remember there are no short cuts son quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets you are part of something here bud the money you make for people creates science and research jobs dont sell that out 
 mr mannheim got a sure thing anacott steel 
 old values buy 
 now thats a crap company sure you will make money on the takeover rumor but whats being created nothing no substance behind it 
 sleep with me and the secrets of the west are yours 
 jesus cant make a buck in this market countrys going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch roosevelt was around too much cheap money sloshing around the world the biggest mistake we ever made was letting nixon get off the gold standard putney drugyou boys might want to have a look at it 
 you got a look in your eye mr mannheim you got something for the small fry 
 that scum built this company up from one plane in thirty years they made something out of nothing and if thats a scum i will take one over a rat any day 
 fine if you dont want us stay with the scum in present managementdedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground 
 no its a prophecy the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians didnt have unions i know what this guy is about greedhes in and out for the buck and he dont take prisoners he dont give a damn about northstar or us 
 i beg your pardon is that a proverb 
 there came into egypt a pharoah who did not know

 harold you dont mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times do you 
 i thought this was an informal meeting whats he doing here 
 ooh ooh tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grownup package does this mean you are ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own because darien if you are through with me you are through with everything im a part of 
 you are really twisted gordon you are incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you theres a poverty that every last dollar in the world wont fill 
 you and i are the same darien we are smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running love a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows 
 maybe it does dont patronize me gordon

 she went to a waxwork party 
 no 
 no jonathan 
 hello mrs webster is china there 
 hello 
 vell goodnight 
 tony and china 
 they seemed closing by much 
 two of your friends left earlier mark uh huh 
 uh yes thank you it was quite enjoyable 
 i hope you enjoyed your visit 
 uh wrong picture tony 
 velcome to ve vaxverk 
 go away 
 sarah listen to me 
 china 
 well it all started when a friend and i 
 well this is mr lincoln and thats the man i saw at the waxwork 
 well 
 whos is all this 
 if my mother caught me up here shed kill me 
 big deal 
 you dont understand i recognized his face now come on 
 oh that explains everything 
 listen sarah i think i know whats going on ok i went to the waxwork todayi met this man 
 you arent sick we have got to get back what are you doing 
 a little 
 ok so maybe i was a little over emotional 
 thats not what you said last night 
 no no james its not like that tony and china they are just friends 
 no im serious its its just i dont know i im looking for something else 
 come on 
 i dont know i really like you and i think you are very attractive 
 no mark mark why not 
 i know what you mean 
 like her i dont know if i ever liked her its just you want what you cant get 
 then why do you still like her 
 im not kidding i want to get out of here now ok 
 wooo jealously rearing its ugly head 
 what tony and china together 
 getting scared dont worry they have probably just gone home 
 i have always wondered why someone would believe in something like that 
 havent we been doing our homework 
 this is killer 
 must be what we came for the four stand slowly and enter through the doors which close behind them they begin walking around the waxworks which appear gruesome the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman they give each other looks of disgust and continue on the next is of a frankensteinesque creature carrying a woman in its arms the four are now roaming around the waxworks individually with tony encountering what appears to be a tribal indian pointing a knife towards a victim mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it on the staircase is a zombiefied creature we see china walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a womans mouth finally we see tony walking up to a cottage room display 
 this time i really dont see anyone man 
 right behind you 
 anyone else not coming 
 right 
 safety in numbers man 
 guys if im going to play the hero at least give me a little room 
 forget her mark shes a bitch 
 i cant believe she went out with that monster last night 
 maybe before the event never after 
 can this be stopped 
 doing what sir wilfred tipping the scales ruining that delicate balance between good and evil i think that our mr lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it theres a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being containing a belonging of his he possessed in earthly form and feeding him the soul of a believing victim you can bring him back to life 
 you get yourself a regular job as satans disciple 
 any student of black magic can do it most of these books will tell you how sarah so what happens when you have sold out 
 sell my soul 
 if you sold your soul to the devil youd never age either 
 six six and six 
 well divide N into three 
 well 
 well its a long storysir wilfred oh good share i love them

 christ thats twice inwhen did they move in 
 oh i wish a woman wouldnt have screwed over the woman she loved no they dont think that way 
 what do you mean they are are you officially a woman now 
 well they are 
 would you stop it 
 no i said i hate what im doing to darcy oh boy men are stupider its true 
 what you are doing darcy since when 
 who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath they must see what the legacy has wrought diedre withered inside herself carlotta killing and stunting her own flesh and blood surely they sense the child you carry and the life it might lead in lashers grasp maybe in death they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life 
 but it doesnt make sense they they used lasher they conspired with him 
 you have always said you felt goodness in them that the witches brought you and rowan together isnt that right they are reaching out to you rowan 
 but why would they do that 
 with his hands 
 two heartbeats 
 two what 
 there are two 
 i wish everyone would stop commenting on my health im the doctor 
 are you alright you look pale 
 lasher is my legacy not michaels aaron i have seen the pain in michael i cant bear to see anymore hes not to know swear to me 
 lasher will act rowan whatever it is he wants hes waited three hundred years to have it facing him alone i dont like 
 but you have not told michael 
 i have seen him again last night 
 i have grown very fond of you you and michael both 
 you have been shadowing the family for thirty years its only fitting you give one af us away 
 thank you for this honor my dear 
 michael you loved that house as a child you could work again you could make it ours we will sweep out the horror and lasher with it 
 going away doesnt mean you leave lasher behind he was on rowans deck and the plane geography seems irrelevant now 
 a spacial entity an organized energy something that precedes our definition of existence 
 then what is he 
 many times over the past thirty years why he shows himself to me i dont know but lashers not some mindless wraith 
 you have to warn her this second im catching the next flight back 
 rowan 
 he chose me for rowan when i was a child 
 what are you talk 
 aaron lieten to me its been lasher from the start 
 every day twice 
 i will probably be back in a weekbut i cant spend christmas in that house you will check on her every day 
 then tell me is it lasher 
 nothing was ever more false 
 ont know what else to do maybe i just dont belong in her life well im already out of her life 
 yes and you have do you see he was passing over into death but the witches sent him back to the one person they knew had the power to save him and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could 
 go back michael do what you can 
 what have the witches always asked of you 
 no shes pregnant aaron shes got that to deal with and the clinic she is not to hear about this dont you think i know she spends half her lite worrying about me listening to my heart arent you the timex still ticking 
 michael rowan should 
 dont tell rowan about this 
 then focus on how you feel about her because your feelings define you take off your gloves michael 
 rowan 
 there is a difference between sensing danger and being afraid what defines you in the landscape michael what anchors your life your work your creativity 
 no scaredycats in the talamasca huh 
 a spirit perhaps evil and he has come to you with diedre gone you have inherited him 
 a what 
 come there is a lot to read 
 i r saw him as a child lots of times but no one else did 
 you sound certifiable yon know that 
 i ask only that you stay here long enough to be educated a few hours 
 rowans mother died at childbirth and she doesnt have any family 
 with her family rowans mother died yesterday 
 how do you know about rowan i didnt cemetery 
 rowans already called the hotel michael at the cemetery by now i would guess 
 jesus i have got to get to the ho 
 its over a month the police say it happens all the time 
 im sure hes alright bea they will find him somewhere 
 cmon now give a little nod to mayfair tradition 
 then you wear it 
 the heir to the fortune must wear the mayfair pendant an her wedding day we should all have to suffer such burdens 
 i dont want it 
 always give the crovd a taste darling now ryan said im supposed to make sure 
 in the bayou they have a saying you choose the music for the dance but fortune picks your partner darling id say you are on a roll 
 mmhmm seems and lot longer 
 you two sees like a perfect fit only two mounths 
 nothing worse than a common tool 
 arent they gauche those steel things are so common 
 gifford that box glued to your hands

 i want to see my mother 
 rowan im beatrice maytair your cousin deedeeyour mother and i we we grew up together 
 hell julien believed it carlotta too and god knows more than a few of us called her a witch

 giff shuttup you are mother was a sweet child rowan a lost little girl in a world too full at things

 down here darling we figure if you are taking a trip to god knows where might as well have one hell of a goingaway party 
 im not like you im not you are cruel 
 did you like it looking down at graham and knowing what you could do 
 but i had to use my hands none before you could kill with their mind graham my dear your uncle 
 you are a murderer 
 and why i put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster to kill the legacy you are the sum of his desires 
 you are mad your mind is sick 
 and that is why i pushed your grandmother onto the stones even as she had him inside her 
 enough 
 witches rowan that is what we are 
 stop it 
 just like your mother and all the others that felt him and used his power and went to hell with a smile 
 it wes a dream 
 lasher touched you and you loved it 
 he 
 hes shown himself to you on the deck in the storm 
 you have the mayfair eyes tell me rowan what have those eyes seen that the mind cant fathom 
 why are you doing this handing out these horrors why 
 anthayour grandmotherher life ended there on the stones head split open like a melon 
 you are a monster 
 she didnt feel them 
 you kept her in this filth in restraints 
 put your hatred for me aside so you can clearly see what is ahead

 i didnt say that im sure it could be but our clients must sign in first checking signatures and a photo ident we had a nasty theft two years ago and we have been very strict since then 
 and it cant be forged 
 thats right 
 so there is only one key 
 then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock 
 tell me brian what would happen if the client lost the key 
 yes it is 
 its cramped in here isnt it brian 
 but if you could show me round now and i will meet you later 
 brian 
 thats very kind of you mr griffiths

 but ellen i told you i have stopped 
 you want me to wear white for you you must be madder than i thought 
 yes

 whats wrong 
 nothing could be better 
 whats wrong 
 demons this wouldnt have been possible without you you have given me incentive ellen i can see clearer now 
 psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons 
 i know this sounds insane ellen but telling you all of this writing the book it feels good dont get me wrong i feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders when i tell you what i have done i cant believe it is meyet i know it was this is like a purging for me 
 what 
 then make it stop 
 i want it to stop it all to stop 
 it was wrong all my life i have been cheated cheated of anything good i shouldnt have been born i was a mistake my natural mother was a whore that makes me 
 what was your relationship with stephanie 
 stephanie loved me she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me she was just old enough we had a ball for years we could do anything anywhere anyhowand we didwe would play games she would be the executioner and i would be the convict she would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me 
 did stephanie kill your mother 
 my sister my adopted sister 
 stephanie 
 noi didnt do iti wish i had but i didnt i was beaten to it stephanie became my mother 
 did you 
 you think i killed my mother dont you 
 tell me about your adopted mother 
 my mother i never knew my real mother i was adopted 
 wonderful like a great release he was a malignant cancer and i had to remove him the world is better without him 
 and how did it feel to be rid of him 
 why not please it would help me 
 why should i 
 tell me how it happened 
 thats rightdont ever think that you and i are the same we are not even remotely similar i did what i had to do for myself for my own self preservation not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy my husband was sick 
 you have killed but you are not a killer 
 i dont think sothis isnt a game you knowthere arent points or leagues sure i killed my husband but i am no killer 
 you are the first person i have ever told any of this to we are birds of a feather ellenwe are in the same league 
 i hated being treated like a failure looked down on my sister used to do that i hated it i should have known when we got married in a registry office of course she wore maroon i just wanted a white wedding i think she thought i was a ticket to the good life i had a good job prospects and she was a slut i didnt know until too late one day i came 
 what didnt you like about her 
 it seemed like a good idea at the time why did you marry your husband 
 then why did you marry her 
 my wife my wife was the only one who really deserved it leslie do this leslie do that leslie its your fault she used to tell me what to wear where to go what to do she mothered me 
 tell me about your wife 
 i have something i have to show you 
 how long have you been watching me 
 why should i feel sorry they are dead 
 do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed 
 let me ask you why do you wear black ellen carter what are you running from 
 is white an expression of innocence do you crave innocence leslie 
 i dont know 
 is their colour an expression of their inner self by that i mean extroverts wear bright colours so what are people who wear white 
 i dont know 
 ok the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white why white white clothes blonde hair 
 i dont want to talk about it 
 the press think that the white angel is a woman why is that do you dress up leslie 
 you know everyone accuses me of being sick the press the tv but im not you know they are i dont watch it for entertainment every night i dont sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner they all say how could he cut her up she was dead i cant hurt something dead and all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen i couldnt eat one of those burgers you dont know what has gone in them 
 what did you do with her 
 no she didnt 
 didnt debbie deserve anymore 
 because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beastssociety is rotting men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft women are making them soft by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention so she doesnt deserve any more 
 i dont know 
 my car i stopped working from my car she could have stopped me you know if she really wanted too that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast if a dog attacked you you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself why then do people get bitten by dogs savaged why 
 oh anywhere whenever i needed to do you know how easy it is to take them you just pick up a hiker or someone off the streets they believe so easily you know look i have something to show you i would say and that would be it one girl i think her name is debbie she had broken down on the motorway and i offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck she just got in and i drove away when i pulled into the layby and took out my knife she just froze and said what do you want i said you know what i want but she didnt getting rid of the bodies is just as easy the first i cut up put in bags with bricks in and tossed them off eldridge bridge in broad daylight the real problem with my work is the blood there is so much of it and it all spurts out so fast like a fountain it made such a mess of 
 where do you kill them 
 no the police say i have killed fourteen but i have not i have killed many more it amazes me how they just havent found the bodies what is society coming to when people just dont get missed i agree some of them are well hidden i probably couldnt even show you where i put them one girl number eight i think the press called it she wasnt even mine i dont know who did it but i didnt 
 you dont know 
 i dont know 
 and how many people have you killed 
 oh about six years since i graduated 
 and how long have you been a dentist 
 im a dentist

 dr steckler 
 except the girl the only one that really mattered

 it better not be my aunt trudy 
 you will never believe whos in there 
 sorry ginger got a little you know enthusiastic 
 you are late bro 
 yeah hes probably been serving cocktails so to speak at the orgies 
 a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what hes seen

 id call you a sick twisted fuck but this is different she wasnt your mother mother 
 how would you like it if i did that to your mothers panties 
 take a whiff of heaven 
 oh how inappropriate is that 
 where they get all the really good porno channels on cable 
 i feel like im entering a forbidden tomb 
 id feel like staying up all night forever or at least till i got the lay of the land so to speak 
 its a lot to digest imagine how youd feel 
 dont be such a pansy all of this is yours 
 and some really fast cars 
 then there must be a whole room made completely of chocolate 
 our plane crashed in the grand canyon a big fiery explosion we never made it to la they needed dental records to identify us and this place this actually is heaven 
 dead 
 i get it now you and me we are dead 
 beauty no we are talking goddess 
 dont tell me another vision of incomparable beauty

 yeah whatever 
 so far away in xenia 
 id kiss your mother with this mouth i mean if she wasnt you know

 not ever never 
 oh well maybe not yet 
 this isnt some N s porno film you dip shit there are no wild sex orgies 
 i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight 
 be cool fake it if you have to 
 this is like my every wet dream come true i dont even care that you are here too bro 
 perv 
 i cant believe thats your mother we are talking babealicious chub fest right here in the N s 
 and like every hamburger guy knows when you get your one big chance at the good life you abuse every second of it until they figure out you dont belong there and kick your sorry ass out 
 wait a second i thought we were hamburger guys 
 dont you know anything about limo etiquette everything in here is included for our pleasure 
 for a guy about to try his first dom perignon you are extremely uptight 
 cut it out before you break something 
 this is the life baby we get ourselves some tail and we are talking spring break 
 maybe he got promoted 
 a bouncer are you serious 
 well dad said 
 who the hell was your father 
 astronomical 
 what are the odds of there being another ted nelson on our flight 
 and nobody knows you are a virgin aw who are we kidding 
 nobody knows about your constant masturbation 
 nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation 
 nobody knows about your mental retardation 
 seriously its like we are being reborn we really could reinvent ourselves here just like you said nobody knows about your massive humiliation 
 poor freud turning in his grave 
 think about itlong tunnel bright lights its full of vaginal symbolism 
 any time any day a man can completely reinvent himself 
 dont do it ted dont do it 
 i defy any and all limits 
 thats crazy talk 
 i defy your hamburger theory of life and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents 
 you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip 
 someday i will find out 
 one thing for sure christy malone aint lookin that good naked 
 were you always this sick 
 the only chick more untouchable than christy malone is miss april hi my names ginger i love tofu burgers rainy nights and riding bareback my biggest turnoff is cell phones during sex heres a tip set it on vibrate honey and dont be stingy with the lube dont knock it till you tried it 
 she smiles at everyone ted shes like a newborn with gas 
 see did you see that 
 that vibe is from your wrist pal you have been overtenderizing your meat again 
 i genuinely think she wants me i feel a vibe 
 thats charlie my best friend hes into beef analogies partly because hes a butchers son and partly because well hes just into beef analogies what can i say hes also a photographer 
 dont get me wrong we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives wishing we could devour them like meltinyourmouth filet mignon but we are strictly hamburger guys ground chuck sixty eight percent lean is about the best we can hope for 
 you and your pep talks 
 come on bro spare yourself the humiliation the degradation 
 god i love being dead 
 we dont generally feature blowup dolls in our magazine but hey if you think theres a market for it 
 these are real live women 
 if it isnt straight by now son you probably should see a doctor 
 let me get this straight 
 every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month its your job ted to decide which of them is right 
 oh god look look 
 never say never 
 this is a fun placebut we dont usually come here until after the orgies 
 naked girls wild sex video games no wonder its called heaven 
 he kicked major ass and you know it 
 not bad for a hack he has a future in yellow journalism 
 jealousy is so unattractive 
 that explains the emptiness that haunts me 
 you have obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers 
 new hushpuppies dont make a new man 
 we reinvented ourselves 
 what gives don corleone 
 then you better get in the water before you get burned 
 god you are so hot 
 maybe on the outside but inside deep down i have always been dripping with special sauces are you hungry 
 come on i was hamburger you were porterhouse 
 i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you 
 oh teddy bear you are funny 
 you expect me to think at a time like this there isnt a drop of blood in my brain 
 i mean what do you think 
 you have changed since second grade 
 well 
 things change now im taking off my clothesall by myself 
 i miss those days when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence 
 remember dress up day you and charlie lifting skirts during recess 
 that was code for i like you 
 which you pulled hard 
 i remember the first time you walked into mrs temples class in N nd grade blue gingham dress blond ponytail 
 you knowtake the pictures 
 do it 
 i have to admit i am so totally turned on we should do it now 
 i do i mean yeah i do 
 i thought id be nervous but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed teddy bear 
 i turned eighteen over spring break im eligible 
 christy you want to be in heaven 
 hi teddy bear 
 makes your shoulders look so big and broad 
 yeah you like 
 great jacket teddy bear 
 the answer is never ted never except maybe in your dreams 
 so thats a maybe 
 you really dont get it do you i am genetically programmed to desire a big buff manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring its like a caveman thing 
 so you will think about it 
 oh ted duh i smile at everyone since i got my braces off 
 but that smile 
 i dont like you we are just friends 
 you like me i like you i guess its pretty obvious to everyone 
 ted have you lost your mind 
 shut up are you serious of course i willof course 
 teddy would you please please please take me to the prom 
 if you dont havei mean 
 yeah 
 and i was wondering 
 yeah 
 well the proms coming up 
 ladies first i insist 
 you go first 
 from your lips to gods ears 
 wouldnt it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing 
 we want you to go to college find a career you love marry a nice girl from a nice family and live happily ever after 
 we think you should give up the magazine sell it let someone else run it whatever it takes 
 we miss our family 
 we miss you we miss our son 
 we are not ashamed of you teddy we dont approve of the magazine or the models or the socalled flesh parties you attend but we can get past all that 
 dont you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family 
 but that doesnt make you the boss of everything son 
 you have to understand this was a big shock for all of us one minute you are our little boy of whom we could not be more proud the next minute you are the owner of this whole pornographic empire 
 we love our lives just the way they are 
 we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday something real and honest 
 ted we put a lot of love in our business 
 oh honey we cant accept this extravagance 
 i always wanted craftsman tools he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors 
 sweetheart what is it 
 of course dumpling its very nice of ted but 
 we cant accept it its much too expensive right dear 
 we own a small family grocery store 
 we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on tuesday morning 
 i will not have my boys arguing 
 shut your pie hole jimmy 
 why dont you just admit what this is really all about im not your real kid and you cant control me anymore 
 watch your tone mister 
 that is your dream not mine my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine 
 you ordered a winnebago 
 i paid off the mortgage i ordered that winnebago you always wanted now you are ashamed of me 
 your mom said you have been ignoring your chores 
 its okay you need me 
 sorry i 
 consider me your fairy godfather except without the fairy part no more mealy apples and bruised bananas ever for the rest of your lives 
 but those are our dreams son we have to make them come true 
 we are grateful ted its not that those craftsman toolsthey are a dream come true 
 finally some gratitude 
 well good every little bit helps 
 dad lets just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore including the bookstore 
 i know they were simple people but did this trip help your college fund at all 
 just say it dad 
 ted its your dad i have a question for you i dont know how to put it tactfully you know im lousy with words 
 not the pit 
 there ya go always remember focus on the peach 
 i guess its better than having tribal patterns carved in my face 
 whatever helps you cope 
 like one of those national geographic specials with the topless chicks 
 think of it as a rite of passage to manhood 
 i guess we could go to disneyland or something 
 be a sport how bad could spring break in los angeles be 
 yeah 
 they did do one great thing they gave us our boy 
 i guess 
 they had a rough life your father was a bouncer your mother was well a twobit stripper there was no place for a baby 
 well why should i 
 son 
 they didnt want me when i was born why should i care 
 of course we are 
 you guys are my parents 
 im getting so good at this 
 sometimes you have to do stuff you dont want to do its all part of growing up and it usually works out peachy in the end 
 the lesson being 
 it was the year of the rhizopus rot grandpa almost lost the farm you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival and in the end you saved the peaches and you didnt have to slaughter your sow 
 you are way ahead of me again 
 remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you 
 grandpa was so strong back then working from the crack of dawn so proud of his peaches 
 dad please 
 i remember spring break of my senior year seems like a lifetime ago 
 its my private business mine 
 we understand your disappointment teddy christy is a pretty sexy provocative voluptuous weuhwe understand your disappointment 
 i guessi dont knowi guess we should leave if we are not wanted 
 well 
 hang in there i will think of something 
 this is humiliating we are being ejected from a prom 
 what do you want me to do 
 ted do something 
 of course we were 
 teddy i thought we were having a moment here 
 whatever you want 
 after graduationmaybe we could go away together 
 hmmm 
 teddy i was thinking 
 then remember you are the heir to a billion dollar empire you have a staff of literally thousands multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still cant even wrap your head around everything that is yours all yours 
 i always knew there was more i felt it 
 or do you have a taste for the good life ted its in your blood 
 and who is ted nelson 
 what do you mean im ted nelson 
 who exactly are you 
 hi ho silver 
 dont worry he found the chocolate room 
 shopping really i should tell my friend 
 hey ted wanna go shopping 
 i almost didnt recognize you withoutyou knowthat stallion betweenyouruhlegs 
 thats me 
 the one with the horses 
 i know im ginger miss april 
 im ted by the way i think i forgot to say that 
 your father liked shifting he said it brought him closer to the engine like a woman purring with ecstasy 
 some of them have to be automatics 
 its your car these are all your cars 
 i dont even know if i should be doing this its a very expensive car 
 the first time can be awkward you just have to get on and try again 
 got it 
 now release the brake and slide the stick into first gear 
 want a lesson 
 i dont have much experience with auhstick 
 you do know how to drive 
 they are in the ignition silly 
 ii dont have the keys 
 everything 
 so here we are dead but we never want you to want for anything that is we want you to have everything 
 before we knew it we created the most popular mens magazine in the entire nation the rest is history 
 can you believe that was me 
 we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this 
 but we did want you its just that you dont always get to keep what you want we knew you needed a real mom and dad 
 if you are anything like yours truly then you probably figure we didnt want you when you were born so who cares if we are dead am i right 
 but dont worrywe will be in heaven the real heaven i mean not that heaven is an actual place but more like a state of being or not being who knows maybe we know now 
 but if you are watching this then it means we bit the dust 
 oh sweetheart we wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you 
 but how can you respect yourself if you dont 
 and the girl i love she hates heaven if i keep it she will never respect me 
 i understand 
 they are not my parents helen my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much 
 your parents would be crushed to think you werent happy with it 
 my legacy 
 giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did when they founded heaven they wished they could take you back but it was too late all they could do was build the empire knowing that someday it would all be yours 
 i wondered about them for so many years i wondered if i looked like them acted like them i wondered why they gave me up 
 they kept this scrapbook of your life it meant the world to them 
 you mean they knew who i was 
 your parents never wanted to interfere with your life ted they knew your mom and dad loved you very much they knew they did the right thing but that doesnt mean they didnt watch you and miss you from afar 
 look the girls of xenia are gorgeous you will see next month we will be back to normal 
 its a little more serious than that bill the stockholders have requested a meeting they want our guarantee that this will never happen again some of them are even calling for teds resignation 
 we will send you the release forms ted our staffers will help in any way they can 
 no problem consider it done i had this idea of shooting on location outdoors you know maybe at some famous xenia landmarks you think that would be a problem 
 im helen mcdole your fathers executive secretary 
 you are on the next plane home 
 matter of fact jay im planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown the girls of xenia just to show my appreciation 
 i see so youd be open to little ladies from pasadena who want to show you their knickers 
 matter of fact jay my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine to expand the traditional western notions of beauty 
 what about the future you planning to rock the boat at all stir things up in heaven 
 im no stranger to the notion of philanthropy andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols 
 are they hitting you up for donations asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee 
 well jay they have been exceptionally supportive 
 how are the hometown folks treating you back in xenia 
 from my wise albeit youthful vantage point the world is your oyster you scored big 
 great 
 you ever look down on them again and call them grocers like its a dirty word and you will be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks got it 
 i didnt forget 
 but just for the record my mom is a kickass schoolteacher and my dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas you seem to have forgotten they opened nelsons family market so they could build something permanent a legacy for us their kids 
 look ted im cool with everything you have long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town you have always had an itch for the good life im happy for you this couldnt happen to a nicer guy 
 thats a crappy thing to say 
 i meant biologically 
 he was my grandfather too 
 funny you should say that my grandfather was a peach farmer 
 you are a peach 
 you cant come back that is you can but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine 
 i miss them too 
 aside from the fact that moms eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isnt broken things couldnt be better 
 are they okay 
 are you kidding mom and dad discover im gone and i will be doing hard time 
 thats it i mean you dont want to order room service or anything we could play games and watch movies and stuff 
 just a formality 
 you want it in writing 
 if you could just sign right there 
 you can have it then im not going back there 
 mom and dad said its yours they seem to think you are coming home 
 its not up to me 
 better view more spacious new carpet its a nobrainer 
 my room 
 i came to ask permission to take custody of your room 
 very funny 
 my new bike 
 so what brings you here at his hour 
 they say money cant buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile 
 most places are jimmy 
 impressive this is bigger than our whole house 
 its really latedo your parents know where you are 
 she knew exactly where you were staying which you neglected to tell me your own brother 
 sheryl petersen is what nine years old what does she know 
 you can call me jimmy again sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious 
 james what are you doing here 
 why cant we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil i mean for gods sake we own a grocery store 
 mom dad meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in hes what youd call clinically bummed 
 you better 
 they are playing our song dare i ask for this dance 
 let your fingers do the walking 
 yellow pages 
 i know where you can find an excellent editorinchief 
 i graduated from college did great summa cum laude and all and im about to launch a brand new magazine called exposed an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia ohio 
 planet ted five years from now whats happening 
 i know where you can find any number of naked girls whod love to hop on board 
 the thing is i will need a first mate 
 very ambitious i like that 
 and i thought maybe id take up boating i have always wanted to be a coxswain 
 i decided to let helen run the magazine i need to go to college learn a few things you know 
 im not going anywhere ted you are the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams 
 julie wow i was afraid you left i was afraid id never see you again 
 keeping your word is something i can actually respect ted 
 the thing is i made a commitment i said id do it and i have to keep my word 
 you think you are working with chimps here 
 you are quick i like that 
 which explains the continued success of heaven for how many decades 
 you have seen one naked breast you have seem them all 
 you are telling me you dont get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts 
 aw julie its my job its like being a doctor 
 i mean your pictorial it bothers me profoundly 
 i know their small town mentality can be maddening 
 i have to be honest with you ted i really despise the girls of xenia 
 but absolutely true 
 thats hard to believe 
 julie i will tell you something that is the gods honest truth i have seen a lot of really beautiful girls i mean a lot but none of them make me feel like you do 
 maybe someday 
 i want you to trust me 
 trust is something you earn over time you dont just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire 
 come on 
 not a chance 
 do you trust me julie 
 you lose trust in someone and its over done gone forever 
 turned out to be a scoundrel eh i saw that one coming 
 you live and learn i realized the most important thing to me above all is trust 
 a portuguese boyfriend sounds very cosmo 
 i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me 
 i see 
 sounds voices music humming all of it can turn me on or off like a switch 
 tell me more 
 im very aural 
 what about you 
 thats refreshingly deviant 
 my fantasy is a totally naked woman wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs 
 wearing them or humping them 
 shoes if you want to know the truth shoes are my thing 
 i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy 
 i have a bit of a goosebump fetish not many people know that 
 my desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh 
 that has more to do with your proximity to me 
 im trembling with excitement 
 look at us its one oclock in the morning on a school night we are in a smoky nightclub hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart 
 amen to that 
 at least its not another N h meeting or a big brother barbecue 
 you expected whips chains merk being cattleprodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood 
 i dont know this place seems pretty tame 
 lets do it 
 i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati 
 hes on the move 
 well where the hell are you 
 thats probably my office 
 then you wont mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week 
 a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade im honing my craft 
 he shut down your paper you are stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches 
 you forget i dislike you at least as much as him 
 theres gotta be something we have to dig deeper 
 thats two words and im out of the exposed business remember i need to graduate besides merks a boy scout 
 in a word merk exposed 
 cut to the chase william randolph your audience is way ahead of you 
 if we were a team we could do anything i mean anything 
 but you never do 
 even when you infuriate me i still want to kiss you 
 i know 
 you are amazing 
 then you will see whos really holding on to you 
 and then what 
 eventually you will let go 
 i feel like im being drawn and quartered like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction 
 its incredibly simple 
 its all so complicated 
 a father is nothing but sperm ted it takes a real man to be a dad 
 i mean my father 
 your dad taught you everything 
 you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him you think he would have bought me a stadium instead of teaching me how to play ball 
 the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted 
 now it makes sense the whole neo bohemian down with hypocrisy fight the power crap you are a poor little rich girl 
 i doubt it 
 i see 
 he phoned it in 
 he cared enough to want you to have it 
 not whatever its two different things 
 whatever 
 he didnt he had it built 
 i cant believe your dad built this for you 
 to the best hiding place in the world 
 where are we going 
 put your eyeballs back in your head william randolph im on assignment a girl has to fit in 
 wowyou clean up nice 
 you have got enough people kissing your ass 
 why cant you be nice to me 
 second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit 
 charlies right jealousy is so unattractive 
 you are implying shes what a gold digger 
 you are so twitterpated you dont even see the miners hat and the pickax 
 well what do you think of her 
 a little respect would be nice thats all 
 and this is not my first time on a private jet so quit acting like im rebecca of sunnybrook farm 
 see you are impertinent rude sarcastic 
 i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted 
 considering this is your first time on a private jet on which you are interviewing the worlds most eligible bachelor you are extremely cavalier 
 undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort 
 my adoptive grandfather who knows what my biological grandfather did 
 i did my homework your grandfather was a peach farmer 
 funny you should say peachy 
 life must be peachy on planet ted 
 write what you want just try not to make it so obvious that you are crazy about me 
 is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release 
 dont write that part 
 you never know around here 
 she said peanuts you cretin 
 interesting 
 i guess 
 i see so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist 
 i felt limited i felt confined i felt like i was suffocating 
 could everybody else tell you were different or were you the only one who knew 
 i dont get the distinction 
 different how different like a dwarf at a basketball game or different like a lesbian in pumps 
 i have to admit i always felt different 
 really you wanna write about me 
 local boy inherits more money than god call me crazy but i smell human interest 
 me 
 then i will write about you 
 what do you want from me im trying to be fair but i cant keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up 
 thats not entirely true 
 im still better than you nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account 
 im trying to help 
 just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesnt mean you are even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago 
 come on julie dont screw up you have some real talent 
 ah ha it was so well hidden you didnt even know it was there 
 in the sense that there is no hidden agenda behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs 
 in what sense 
 your article sucked 
 what is it william randolph your balls need scratching 
 its so nice to have friends like you christy 
 a few billion bucks and suddenly hes cromagnon man of the year 
 it was for your own good in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way 
 but you tripledogdared me 
 i tried to warn you william randolph shes got stiletto heels hidden in those keds 
 do it i tripledogdare you 
 i have absolutely no intention 
 go ahead ask her to the prom get it over with 
 meow 
 i didnt know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job 
 christys a very talented journalist i see a pulitzer in her future 
 dont even tell me you are hot for miss titty pom poms over there 
 look i loved exposed and i hate it that you got busted i know the school paper sucks in comparison but its really not that bad 
 is it true is ignorance bliss 
 the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable my award winning expos changed all that the city added an extra weekday trash pickup 
 let me guess retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof 
 thats just one example my reporting has made a difference 
 so william randolph your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale 
 dont say shit honey use the strong vocabulary god gave you 
 i need your help im really in deep shit 
 oh teddy we missed you so much 
 everything i am is because of you can you ever forgive me 
 forget the store think big 
 but who would run the store 
 like take that trip to buckingham palace go deep sea fishing in the gulf of mexico nows your chance 
 like what 
 you are free you can do anything you ever wanted to do 
 oh goodness 
 dont you get it in one day i earn more interest than the stores entire annual revenue 
 but how would we pay our bills 
 you dont have to work another day in your lives 
 i will make you very proud 
 you promise you will finish school 
 only the best for my mother 
 oh good lord are those neptunes 
 mom believe me i could buy all that and the factories they came from 
 everything is lovely ted but much too expensive 
 just a few tokens of my affection i will be back soon dont worry

 well surprised 
 its okay mom trust me 
 save it honey we want to hear every detail when you get back but we dont want you to run up mr zukermans phone bill

 charlie at a will reading what did i do to deserve this

 thats part of growing up honey 
 i dont have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town 
 no cursing in this house young man use the strong vocabulary god gave you 
 what is this does everybody know everything im about to say or do every freakin minute of the day 
 alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind 
 you called the cops on us 
 our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking 
 what law merk having fun letting down our hair on prom night 
 mr nelson you disappoint me first you break our school board rules then you break the law 
 you kicked us off your turf merk dont rain on our parade 
 a new pediatric wing at the hospital a presidential campaign name it anything 
 im warning you 
 a statue in front of city hall dedicated to principal dick merkin 
 you are crossing the line mr nelson 
 deaf ears mr nelson i answer to a higher power 
 come on its our only senior prom 
 rules are rules 
 honestly merk its like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire 
 if that were true this would be one seriously constipated town most guys in xenia have been looking at naked girls in heaven since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress 
 we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community 
 with all due respect to merk he doesnt have to read my magazine but he has no right to stop others ever hear of the first amendment 
 i guess you wont be wanting that rolex i sent you then 
 what kind of sick question is that i will be watching you young man your money and power mean nothing here nothing 
 have you ever even looked at heaven 
 i never figured you for a pimp 
 are you kidding this magazine is my dream its every redblooded heterosexual males dream 
 thats a good start yes a very good start 
 you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks i dont want your silly billion dollar empire 
 ted you are the best editor this school paper ever had you dont need to be pandering flesh its nonsense its beneath you 
 yes sir i will brace myself 
 i will be blunt i know you can take it 
 thanks principal merkin 
 i like you ted you know that i liked you before you were filthy rich 
 aw come on kid throw me a bone im your uncle for gosh sakes 
 thats right and guess whos the new king of the unemployment line 
 all is fair in heaven tedbaby 
 thanks for teaching me an important lesson what makes a family is love not blood 
 my job back off benedict 
 what are you doing 
 peaches canned peaches 
 i loved my brother i stood by his wishes to let his son run the company a son he never knew a son that he and his wife gave away at birth a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own nevertheless i was there for the lad i guided him as best i could but hes only seventeen with a mind of his own and judgment that is well frankly not a chip off the old block there is only one clear solution and i think we all know what that is 
 we have got a huge problem with the magazine tedbaby our readers hate it hate it we need to talk 
 yes 
 you are a great kid dont you forget it 
 thanks uncle billy thanks for everything 
 you are right i should work too our first issue together is almost ready to print 
 id love to but i really need to crack the books final exams are coming up and i have been slacking 
 yeah well like my grandpa used to sayyou cant change your christmas past but you sure can exchange your christmas presents 
 i wish i knew you years ago when my brother was alive i wish he never gave you up 
 i owe it all to you without your help id be lost 
 you are taking this bull of an empire by the horns but you are still keeping your small town values you are not letting all this stuff spoil you 
 seriously im doing all right 
 such enthusiasm have i told you lately how proud i am of you 
 it was incredible the light the crowd everything 
 i cant wait to see the pictures 
 i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red 
 he was in a league of his own 
 my father must have been amazing 
 really so im doing ok 
 so far so good some of them have real angel potential 
 im ted nelson i guess you already know that part for two years i have been the editor of the high school paper in xenia ohio i have won some awards made a difference i have always had journalism in my soul now i know why 
 dont forget to tell them all your qualifications 
 thats perfect 
 at our press conference tomorrow i think we should announce our plans to explore the world not just a few leggy N ds with blond hair upstairs and down 
 in other words our scope is too narrow 
 the world is a big beautiful place we can open new markets in africa and asia imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine 
 you think we should be more open minded 
 wellfor one thingi think its despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of classic beauty 
 what kind of ideas 
 its not like i didnt have ideas i had plenty of ideas but i never even shared them with your father never had the guts 
 my parents always say hard work builds character 
 i never finished school myself never had to my brother built this empire from nothing but his wifes perky tits and a whole lot of gumption he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter i never struggled for a second 
 you seem like you are anything but lazy uncle billy 
 i have been very lazy for a long long time 
 really youd do that for me 
 you are home but go ahead finish school do what you feel you need to do in the meantime i will be your point person here on the magazine 
 its really going to be strange going home in a couple of days 
 no one will be laughing at you now ted you can take that to the bank 
 i would have been laughed right out of xenia 
 you were the new and improved you

 and the other girl kelly suzies niece 
 so suzie and sandra van ryan were half sisters 
 raised her like she was but no walters my only child he was a good boy till the army took him 
 suzie then you are not her grandmother 
 she had it before she drank herself to death wasnt exactly a love child 
 and the child 
 wasnt enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here he got to be old he and his rich cronies would come down here hunt and whore act like assholes one trip he showed up with this young girl hed picked up somewhere gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp that came with her 
 was there ever any kind of investigation 
 no not after that night i dont know what happened maybe he caught her with some john all i know is the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy indian kid named davy used to live down the road there in a wrecked car him and suzie were at the glades that night it was right after that ray got suzie busted and sent her away thats what there is to say about ray duquette 
 she still work there 
 got sort of hung up on her from what hear 
 he used to come around here he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the glades 
 actually i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette 
 about suzie 
 i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions 
 you come all the way out here to watch walter 
 then i guess walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye he dont use it for no good deeds anyway 
 what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway 
 gator cant see whats in front of it for shit they see out the sides that one dont even know walters arms in his mouth 
 i know one thing he said it was when when he took himself out and was standing up he said dont worry i didnt come i cant forget that he said no little girl can ever make me come 
 try kelly 
 not at first he was still inside but he wasnt moving or anything he said we had this secret and that now hed be able to help me because we were close something like that i dont know its hard to remember exactly 
 you mean he withdrew 
 he kept saying let it happen let it happen then he just stopped 
 then what 
 i he had my wrists pinned behind me i remember my hands were cold 
 did you try to fight him 
 he was large 
 no i have done it a couple of times i mean with guys i dated but this hurt like he was built you know 
 thats okay kelly you are doing fine but i have to ask you something here when you say it hurt was this the first time a man was inside you 
 yes i said stop i screamed i mean thats how it sounded in my head he hurt me 
 was there penetration did he put himself inside you 
 he said something like do you want it dirtyN or something i tried to turn away but he pushed me to the floor 
 i understand 
 they were in me both places you know 
 take your time 
 the next thing his hand was in my shorts you know from behind his fingers his fingers 
 i know you do 
 i just want to get it over with my moms making me do this i just want to forget it 
 how are you kelly would you like to take a break for a minute 
 suzie 
 kellys file read it you are going to find an angry sexually confused girl whos made threats on her mothers life and a female lover shed never identify 
 you could tell me where you were last night 
 i dont know what to say 
 ray thinks she was murdered 
 maybe she used another name 
 she didnt cone home last night we found her car at the bus terminal but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket 
 how long 
 suzie toller is missing 
 isnt that against the law peeking into windows 
 theres a strip mall not half a mile from my house theres phones there i cruised the place but i didnt see her i figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didnt want to be found i dont know maybe i should have called but its not like kelly cant take care of herself i figured wed just take it up on monday in the office 
 werent you a little worried about her 
 no 
 did you call anyone did you call her house to see if she got home did you call the masons 
 again i think we covered this i told her i was going to call a cab 
 and when you turned her toward the door where did you expect her to go without a car 
 id like that 
 if old pictures interest you come back some time theres quite a collection down in the pagoda i will see you get a proper tour 
 its homicides job now ray let em do it i will tell you something else theres more to this story than you know ray if suzie is dead i think hunter may be on the right track 
 the blood type on the rocks matches suzies 
 hes leaving the country and i dont give a shit 
 wheres lombardo 
 im tired ray im going home 
 if im wrong about those teeth its a promise 
 and if the teeth arent suzies you will give this up 
 stick with me on this gloria i need you 
 what if im right gloria what if im right and hunters wrong what do you do if you see a bad thing coming 
 ray you heard him 
 will you do me one favor 
 we dont know that ray 
 poor dumb suzie she never had a chance 
 you dont think sam could have put it there 
 her grandmother said shed been threatening to run away and i found the car at the miami bus terminal 
 the swamp most likely lombardos a swamp rat knows the body will never be found there but hes made a mistake 
 wheres the body 
 those are suzie tollers teeth 
 two kids could have gotten into a fight lost a couple of teeth 
 just check out the car 
 if you want company 
 you have someplace to be 
 im gonna take you back to the office will you put out a call on suzies car for me 
 ray we dont know anything yet she could be anywhere 
 its starting gloria this is how it begins 
 i mean something bad gloria something bad you saw coning and you didnt do anything and then it happened i did that once i dont want to do it again 
 we all have 
 were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didnt do what you could to stop it 
 you could say that 
 guess i kind of lost it there 
 what you wouldnt go after some guy you thought raped your daughter cone on she bought the same story we did 
 which she might have saved if she hadnt set out to destroy the mans life 
 i net a guy in a bar 
 whered you come up with this stuff anyway 
 you got it the rich got richer while the saps like lombardo went bellyup in the swamp 
 eliminate the competition 
 i flat dont like the guy glory hes dirty and i will tell you something else you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan on a little item known as the salt creek land deal it was after the war van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land got investors like lombardo to put up money then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve on the sly of course but everyone knew it was him the freeway went to the coast right where van ryan wanted it 
 this ones got you working overtime hasnt it 
 her father didnt leave her squat the kids got money in trust from her grandfather but she cant touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck 
 so what about the girls suzies poor but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother surely her father 
 the job looks okay to us but look at it from his point of view the mans surrounded by wealth and privilege but for him its just a reminder of what should have been his 
 why you ask me lombardo had it pretty good already nice job in a beautiful setting popular an active social life hes gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you are describing 
 they chumped us gloria right from the start 
 unless you are setting up sandra van ryan for the big payday 
 unless what 
 i thought of that then i said come on you are lombardo your reputation is getting trashed you want to stop the bleeding you dont want to sit in jail for three months unless 
 maybe lombardos attorney was saving the affair for the trial 
 think back before the suit was filed before the trial lombardo had an affair with sandra right so why not tell us about the affair i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place 
 lombardos settlement 
 you saw the news today 
 its a shithole but she was dirty what was i gonna do 
 thats what they called it when i was in juvenile its a pretty dismal place 
 you mean camp sixtynine 
 this is where she lives she wants to talk beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all i busted her once for possession she wound up doing about six months at camp nine 
 the skinny brunette 
 you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay 
 yeah well van ryan got his i dont imagine he gives a shit now 
 you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark you know what you get more bark and more bark theres no core trees not good tar anything but sucking up water and now they cant get rid of them they have tried poisons nothing works they dont die 
 all im saying is we let sandra van ryan push us too hard we are going to wind up looking stupid 
 you are telling me you believe the guy 
 we failed to mention the mower guys a drunk that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house so he cant say how long she was in there same with the kids they saw her running down the street but thats it with no physical evidence what do we have her word against his 
 still doesnt explain why he couldnt catch up with her i mean how long does it take to put on a shirt 
 same as him they saw her come they saw her go they saw him follow 
 hunters making it our job because sandra van ryans got a bug up his ass you know that as well as i do we are gonna trash this guys life and i keep asking myself if its really necessary 
 its our job gloria 
 all im saying is i think we should go slow here 
 that would make it about the time of her old mans suicide you dont think that could explain some erratic behavior 
 back to the land of grownups 
 i have got that two oclock in town 
 he said no little bitch can ever make me come 
 what was that 
 he did say something 
 no he stopped by himself okay thats all let me go 
 at that point were you able to fight him off 
 i guess 
 did he come in with you 
 yes 
 so you were alone 
 no 
 and when he arrived at your house was anyone there 
 yeah 
 he dropped jimmy off first 
 about a year ago 
 we need to tape the interview suzie no one will see it but us now when was this that mr lombardo gave you the ride 
 you didnt tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news 
 why is that 
 yeah maybe a little 
 that bothers you 
 i dont care you heard that girls statement i think hes dirty get me a case 
 you know what that will mean for lombardo 
 i want a fullscale investigation 
 i worked juvenile in dade county for three years we had a missing persons on kelly van ryan for two weeks maybe a year ago the family kept it out of the papers 
 wheres this coming from 
 that doesnt make him a child rapist theres something else this girls had some problems wrecked a couple of her moms cars ran away 
 i think shes acting i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her i think maybe shes upset that he didnt 
 why 
 suzie tollers and thats the only thing saving your sorry ass 
 the teeth were they 
 she looked shaky but lucid i thought i would just go with her stand at the door i think i looked away a split second then bingo just like that she puts a knee into my groin there was this coffee table between us and the wall she got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case thing had a glass door i could hear it breaking i didnt go down but she slowed me up just enough before i could get to her shed turned on me with this small caliber handgun i yelled at her to put it down she got off a shot i took it in the shoulder i i had no choice i returned fire two rounds i think in the chest 
 you didnt cuff her 
 i told her i was coming with her she nodded like she understood we stood up together 
 bit scratched but i had her pinned she calmed down i was going to cuff her she said she thought she was going to be sick she asked to use the bathroom 
 she bit you 
 i told kelly van ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder i did her rights 
 just tell us what happened 
 i fucked up i lost control of the situation the one thing they train you for god what did i do 
 get off this ray now if there is any evidence here its for homicide you get an id you call me 
 kellys next gloria 
 you think this is just about money about us looking foolish question him you are gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath and those girls are going to wind up dead 
 oh ray no 
 i dont believe im hearing this a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse they were acting they were all acting from the beginning and we bought it hook line and sinker and now they are home free with six million of sandra van ryans money 
 ray the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible what we have here is you on the van ryan property without a proper warrant shooting a porn flick 
 you heard kelly say sam that was lombardo on the phone and you saw the girls 
 are you crazy ray 
 and what do they say 
 we have got three guy mowing his yard couple of kids playing hoops 
 what about witnesses 
 not that stuff about her running away him trying to find her thats bullshit 
 the line i get on this guy is that hes done half the women in blue bay 
 or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for 
 your honor please 
 he was my friend at first then i got busted he didnt even stick up for me i had to go away to that hellhole its like you are his favorite then who cares you wanna know something when kelly said we should do this i thought cool all these big shots screwing me over like that cop duquette now they are gonna get screwed 
 im sorry 
 this wasnt my idea 
 ms toller im asking you now under oath did samuel lonbardo rape you 
 i said he did 
 ms toller 
 because it was the biggest i have ever seen and i have seen a lot on their way through jacks fish camp 
 im sorry you said it hurt why

 you got something against cigarettes 
 you ought to watch it with that shit suzie you get busted again you go back in a twotine loser 
 then he will be back at blue balls

 yes we call it a winch and these are shrouds and these are stays 
 you mean this thing 
 kelly was supposed to be framed not killed what im telling you is i dont like surprises 
 did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle jesus man it couldnt have worked out better they are convinced kelly whacked suzie i cant talk em out of it we should be celebrating this thing worked out just like you said only better 
 well shit you are the cop they dont teach you to disarm people shoot them in the leg or something you werent supposed to kill her for christs sake 
 hey what did you want me to do die 
 the bitch shot me is what happened 
 yeah well you fixed that what the hell happened anyway 
 sit down lombardo 
 fuck you this is bullshit im outta here 
 with a thirtyfive inch bustline in a wet tshirt with no bra 
 it is and i dont ordinarily but i mean theres this kid standing in front of you crying 
 but you do admit to touching her to putting your arm around her isnt that against the rules 
 thats right 
 but she ran away 
 yes mainly to turn her toward the door i told her we would talk on monday in the office 
 and she began to cry and you put an arm around her 
 i could but its confidential look the point is we didnt talk i told her this was not an appropriate time or place 
 but you cant tell us what she wanted to talk about 
 yes 
 and she wanted to talk 
 yes 
 in cutoffs a wet tshirt 
 like i said i hadnt really expected to use it anyway im going through a drawer i hear a car i look out the window i see nicole driving away i leave my room and theres kelly 
 the one you bought at school 
 i had to go look for this coupon 
 storys the same detective 
 why dont you tell us one more time how kelly came to be with you alone in your house 
 i think theres some things you do you dont want to see yourself doing them 
 walter hes been aimin that brownie through knotholes for years i saw these i knew hed finally struck gold i cant decide which came out better that little straw kellys got up her nose or that vibrator you have got up her ass what do you think mr lombardo 
 how 
 well id need the famous lombardo charm not that youd have to do anything you havent done already 
 we 
 i have seen you out there in your old air boat thinking about what might have been old man van ryan hadnt fucked you out of it what if i told you i had a way we could get a big piece of it back 
 trust me the guys dirty he will like it especially the part about offing me now get out of here go make yourself a new friend 
 yeah real funny you are wrong about this i could get busted on the spot 
 seems to like some of the same places you do funny you never met 
 fuck the winch i wanna drive 
 whats wrong 
 that was the same thing ray said 
 what 
 but then it is better this way dont you think no loose ends 
 but then you knew what he was like all along maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on 
 the guy was history when he killed kelly you knew that 
 that was about as grim as it gets 
 no no look i probably should have told you a little more about the part i intended to play we will go through it all again tonight 
 are you mad at me 
 i was worried about you suzie i decided we should all get together one more time before we split up 
 good just keep telling yourselves that the only people who can fuck this up is us 
 yeah right 
 shut up dont fall apart the only people who can blow this is us remember 
 but i 
 put kelly on too 
 sam 
 jesus two million one hundred thirtythree thousand three hundred thirtythree and change 
 how much is about six and a half million divided by three 
 goodbye sandra 
 grab a clue sam you are a hired hand around here enjoy it while it lasts

 well we will stay in touch you know 
 well sure didnt you get your orders 
 what is this a whole new train 
 artemus look at that brand spanking new shes a beauty huh lets get rolling 
 in the next two minutes 
 all right all right it will be okay i mean eventually it will just run out of steam 
 he was going to shoot me do you mind 
 the machine was stopped it seemed like a perfect time to disable it whyd you have to throw it into full throttle 
 oh i see an easy plan 
 pull the balloon right in front of him we will board the damn thing 
 where have you been 
 my god hes so excessive 
 thats thats the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts 
 god in heaven what is that 
 thank you 
 my hat is off to you sir 
 of course not 
 are those just button buttons or 
 well hell maybe we do have a chance 
 it was in your book 
 oh well then lets kick some ass 
 theres only seventyeight 
 id love to stop him but have you noticed the hundred armed men 
 we have got to stop him right here now with that armored steam engine of his it will be a slaughter 
 i dont have to tell you what that would do to our careers 
 i know i know 
 what president grant is 
 artemus you ready for this his next target is albuquerque 
 my pleasure 
 oh thank you 
 excellent detective work sir you should have the honor of going first 
 not likely there must be tracks of twenty different wagons freight wagons carriages buckboards 
 what if these tracks are just leading us to an indian village or some old coots mining claim 
 oh no we split him fiftyfifty 
 when we find him he is mine 
 you said it popped out too easily nothings ever good enough for you is it 
 so the idea is if a guy punches me he really hurts his hand 
 i adjusted it 
 not again 
 my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case i spent three years on the stage you know remind me sometime to regale you with my lear 
 and people are actually fooled by that 
 this im testing a new spirit gum to see how it holds 
 what is that 
 we oughta get a couple of those rockets voom we are there before we left 
 relax we are almost there 
 damn i wish this thing would go faster 
 that rules out willard vermont willard minnesota willard new mexico 
 got to be somewhere thats hot he said it was damnably hot 
 its a town 
 its not a guy 
 willard 
 yes and a much nicer one than ours 
 sounds like a train looks like a train 
 whats this 
 youd think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen 
 no record of him 
 hes going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named willard 
 it is 
 its better than nothing 
 oh damn thats it 
 shhh come on tell us something 
 this is good 
 a cylinder recorder my own design 
 sure its a windup thing 
 know what this is 
 you go ahead i will stick with loveless 
 come on lets at least see if we can find dr pemberton 
 thank you 
 sure we have no idea whats going on 
 can you fill me in here 
 you really enjoy yourself dont you 
 they are so precious when they are asleep 
 i find most criminals slip up somewhere 
 strange youd think hed have this place better guarded 
 i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun 
 you might have mentioned you had that 
 i was six and ever since my policy is act first and worry later 
 uh how long ago was this 
 those kids they took my wagon never got it back 
 so what happened 
 nothing much to it really when i was younger i got into a pretty bad runin with the wyler boys i saw them coming but i didnt act fast enough secondguessed myself and it cost me cost me dearly 
 well that too 
 spontaneous i like that most people say something like hare brained reckless sonofabitch 
 so spontaneous all that leaping off buildings and chinese fighting and whatnot 
 what way is that 
 if you dont mind my asking were you always the way you are 
 which is why we are heading to houston texas home of the loveless steam engine works 
 no im not all right they got away and we cant even follow them they can get off the tracks anywhere they want 
 jim are you all right 
 thats right thats good 
 at least the things not that fast we just follow it whenever it stops we are there waiting 
 damn it this is ridiculous 
 hey i tried the board 
 at least i tried something 
 its a repeating steam cannon 
 never seen a gun fire so fast 
 im going to hit you 
 could i just point out this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention 
 and if they have got dr loveless building weapons like those flying bombs they just might do it 
 garrison then the president was right except its not a foreign power its a bunch of die hard rebels trying to make the south rise again 
 that oh its a kind of chinese fighting i was sort of caught once with a lovely chinese girl out in san francisco her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me i have got a book on it if you are interested 
 all that jumping and kicking 
 all what 
 what was all that back there 
 good i wasnt sure you were up to it 
 you are either having a seizure or you just said hello 
 now what was that 
 come on jim im serious dot dash it will be our secret means of communication should we ever need it 
 you feeling all right 
 yes now observe 
 almost 
 you know your morse code almost as well as i 
 then we have got our proof excellent and where do we find this fortunate scientist 
 all right how about this we put a watch on this pemberton somebody tries to grab him 
 whoa jim maybe but we cant arrest this little pillar of society on maybe 
 doctor v l pemberton i knew it hes a scientist all right inventor of the pemberton condensed steam engine im telling you artemus loveless is our man 
 do your own mingling im not hanging around with some dandy named chauncey 
 quite come lets mingle 
 thats a lot of butler 
 jim people talk to foreigners speak more openly especially to those as famous as i chauncey mcneil armstrong english lyric poet 
 call me that again and you are going to find a boot where it doesnt belong 
 come llewellyn dont tarry 
 my disguise and here 
 prepare what 
 doyle once around the park i need a moment to prepare 
 absolutely have to look for clues even if it means dancing with beautiful women 
 limestone quarry southern mansion easy to get them mixed up i say we invite ourselves to the party 
 limestone quarry 
 what about the explosive 
 yes starting with a screw now its not fair of me to expect someone whos spent his life wrangling with western desperadoes to fully appreciate what im doing here but 
 starting with a screw 
 potentially this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain 
 is this leading somewhere 
 yes aha a brass screw 
 aha 
 aha 
 i will work on it 
 that should put us ahead of the criminals 
 well its the only one i have its gotten me out of quite a few tight spots 
 your little jackinthebox gun that might be useful 
 try what 
 all right if it will make you happy i will try that 
 good lord man the world is changing and mark me it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention we as defenders of the right must keep pace 
 no offense but all i ever need are these and this 
 always hoping or this 
 you need that real often 
 attractive buttons yes but yank one off toss it and poof it emits a cloud of sleeping gas 
 gadget guy while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses i am sir in my own humble way a man of science 
 wait a minute now i know where i have heard of you you are the gadget guy 
 sorry didnt mean that just a little device of mine 
 ay theres the rub take a look at this file on professor morton quite a brilliant fellow metallurgy 
 then why kidnap them why not just kill them 
 a giant hydraulically operated microscope that explodes or maybe just someone who hates scientists 
 put them all together and what do we have 
 eight scientists eight different fields of endeavor hydraulics optics ballistics 
 wouldnt dream of it 
 but dont pull that again 
 if you are implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion then i for one am fully prepared to do so al fresco 
 you are quite the wordsmith fiddle boy but nobody smoothtalks his way into my assignment 
 funny i was just thinking you should do the same since i am already in residence and am obviously the man for the job its been grand making your acquaintance sir and best of luck in all your future endeavors 
 just another bureaucratic foulup you know how these pencilpushers are so why dont you just run on back and explain what happened 
 interesting mine say the same thing and they dont mention you not even as a valet although we could talk 
 your train listen friend you are obviously lost i have got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime 
 congratulations unfortunately my train is about to leave and i really must insist you disembark 
 funny so am i 
 valet you jest of course i am a us marshal 
 i dont mind him but who the hell are you my valet or something 
 artemus gordon bach hes the composer 
 jim west 
 j s bach

 wonderful our new friend from the wild west please

 anyone 
 we will see 
 a new friend 
 fine i will stop

 i try please if you promise to protect me i will testify against him i will give you an ironclad case 
 you bring the best out in a man 
 my its gotten longer 
 really like general garrison or didnt you hear all that shooting 
 shes perfectly safe 
 i have had some practice 
 you have done this before 
 oh i would hope not 
 would that include me 
 just a little insurance against the unexpected 
 i suppose so but life can be hard for a man too 
 thank you but the truth is im a single woman in a mans world that leaves me very few choices doesnt it 
 forgive me but you dont strike me as the social secretary type 
 im not so sure dr loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger 
 you tell me 
 have you taken a wrong turn mr tyler 
 i dont like to lose either 
 you must excuse the doctor no one has ever beaten him at his little game 
 you most certainly do 
 well i owe you one dont i 
 oh dont worry i have already overlooked the fact your names not actually on our guest list 
 yes in a way im the doctors social secretary i handle his correspondence send out the invitations you know 
 your guests maam 
 well sir you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests 
 my the wild west 
 well where i come from it kind of goes with the territory texas 
 really 
 please do im a man who appreciates a good firearm 
 i dont recollect ever being compared to a pistol before 
 you know maam you remind me of a pearlhandled pistol i once owned a beautiful thing to look at but too hot to handle 
 i get that feeling you know mr tyler im the kind of woman who doesnt believe men are much more than a complete waste of time but after spying you across the room im tempted to suspend my disbelief at least for the evening 
 my names tyler frank tyler pleased to meet you maam 
 i would mr doyle are you game 
 would you be thinking ramming speed sir 
 my friend 
 doyles the name sir of the connemara doyles and theres not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself that having been said sir you are five minutes late so lets be on our way your friends already aboard 
 that would be correct orders from the president himself trans portation at your beck and call no delays although the governments generosity takes me a tad by surprise as well 
 private train 
 your private train sir 
 well captain then the answer is your train is still here 
 look im captain james west 
 a mistake to assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the chattanooga river and single handedly trapped jacksons entire cavalry how is that a mistake 
 why surely mr president there must be some mistake i mean 
 french damn it i want my own man on this case somebody i trust somebody who doesnt mind breaking up the furniture 
 yes sir 
 french 
 of course sir thats why i have assigned a new man and hes no ordinary marshal hes quite sophisticated three college degrees a master of disguise speaks french 
 listen in two days im embarking on a tour of the western territories and i want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence 
 well yes sir a professor morton but with just a little more time sir i can assure you a breakthrough on this case 
 dont try to bamboozle me colonel has another scientist been kidnapped or not 
 he didnt thats your job im taking you off that other case until you have nabbed this lunatic good luck nice train but mines nicer 
 whered he say he was going to do this 
 on my way to denver 
 well of course you can mr president what a surprise what brings you here 
 and now the jobs yours 
 and 
 goddamnit what am i doing whats happened to all my cigars colonel richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year no arrests no leads no clues 
 part of some speech they wrote for this trip im taking 
 nicely said sir 
 we find ourselves at the dawn of the golden age of science and it is the godgiven destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way 
 exactly any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced 
 but what would anyone have to gain from all this unless it were a foreign power 
 nice to finally meet you sir 
 this is colonel richards 
 good work really 
 that will be all boys 
 mr president good to see you again sir sorry about all that 
 easy easy on just what grounds should i take it easy 
 easy now 
 so im the only one here who can tell the difference between an emperor and a murderer 
 because i am holding all the western territories hostage mr west a town a day will disappear willard was merely a test run a stroll in the park next i level all of albuquerque yes thats right only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know your own president will be there what an added bonus the gods are shining on me after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire 
 well your highness what makes you think we will ever sign a treaty with you 
 the first 
 emperor miguelito 
 i have even printed my own currency 
 call it what you like the point is i was heir to that land mr west it belonged to my beloved grandmother now i intend to have it back my own country 
 that would be the mexican war 
 these lands were taken by force from mexico in the illegal war of american aggression 
 exactly you are on foreign soil you are a representative of the occupying forces or havent you checked a map lately 
 the us is my jurisdiction 
 has it penetrated yours that im holding a gun on their leader 
 has it penetrated that adrenaline addled skull that you are surrounded by seventyeight of my loyal followers you are in my domain 
 you got that right now get up we are walking out of here 
 philistine 
 he had a pressing engagement 
 still alive hmm i suppose that doesnt bode well for poor bruno 
 restrain yourself voltaire hes just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant 
 you are not that big 
 dr loveless 
 and do give me some room voltaire you are breathing on my head i hate it when you breath on my head 
 talk about what oh about who you are and all that 
 why dont we just cut this routine short whatever you do to us we are not going to talk 
 how embarrassing did i hold up three fingers 
 sir i believe you have only two barrels 
 i deal with some tough customers 
 really must be a dangerous business 
 no sir just a businessman 
 very good sir i think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade 
 thank you i confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says i cannot have 
 i must compliment you on miss thompson an exceptionally charming assistant 
 when you are three and a half feet tall sir life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not come with me wont you 
 i admire a man with a sense of humor 
 you dont know what hes built surely you dont think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this 
 i beg your pardon 
 it is 
 now its a bomb 
 its a smelting retort 
 this is something 
 hes just full of plans that arent gonna work out 
 he hes planning to kill us isnt he 
 for the moment but i fear not for long im of no use to him now 
 are you all right 
 a glass eye thats who it was oneeyed jack garrison otherwise known as general garrison confederate third army i saw him at dr loveless party but i couldnt place him he used to wear an eyepatch 
 a southern gentlemen i dont recall his name i suppose its unkind of me to say it but he had the most disconcerting glass eye 
 who was this partner of his 
 i only met him once but that was enough for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself he offered me the rare and unparalleled opportunity to develop a new steam engine for him he claims to have some sort of factory in texas i believe said i could have the run of the place he had all sorts of specifications but when i questioned him closely it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman both he and his partner had no real love of steam its sad so few men do 
 we will explain on the way 
 who were they what do they want with me 
 gotta get the doctor someplace safe 
 yes 
 dr pemberton 
 right

 your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood i have them soakingyou can wear these 
 very interesting im learning a lot about manure whats that 
 enjoying your reading 
 its not the gun dont you understand its you what you stand for that is not for samuel 
 nobody meant any harm the boy was curious i unloaded the gun 
 john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible 
 you tell him when you are able 
 tell him his tea stinks 
 but you cant 
 listen thank you thanks for everything but i have got to go 
 two days 
 how long have i been here 
 what 
 how long 
 only the elders 
 does anybody know im here 
 can i have something to drink 
 the leadership of our district the diener bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top they decided to come and see you for themselves except stoltzfus of course he came the first day i think he saved your life 
 who are they 
 but  
 gunshot they will file reports they will find me 
 but why 
 no no doctor 
 but john why didnt you go to a hospital 
 what about samuel will you come back to take him to trial 
 i cant 
 stay for awhile rest i will make coffee and breakfast 
 i was wrong 
 you said we would be safe in philadelphia 
 you couldnt wait until morning 
 home 
 where are you taking us now 
 you will be safe you dont have to worry 
 im afraid im afraid for samuel i want to go home 
 because  somehow  they knew i was getting close look its narcotics they make dope out of chemicals they sell it on the street for millions of dollars they will do anything and they can get away with it because they are cops 
 but why would they murder 
 listen im the cop that polices the police im not in the business of protecting crooked cops i will make an arrest when i know everybody involved 
 why dont you arrest that man are you protecting him because policeman 
 oh yes she thinks you like policing because you think you are right about everything and you are the only one who can do anything and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a um bag of elbows 
 oh anything else 
 she thinks you should get married and have children of your own instead of trying to be a father to hers except she thinks you are afraid of the responsibility 
 no 
 your sister said you dont have a family 
 whats a good tired tired is tired 
 but not a good tired 
 i would not be too sure 
 they kid a lot 
 no you are not  you are glad because now you have got a witness i heard the other police talking last night they dont seem to like you very much 
 look im genuinely sorry 
 people who dont go into our courts when they are told to sometimes go directly into our jail 
 we do not go into your courts 
 believe me im trying to get this over with as fast as i can but samuel will probably have to come back and testify 
 yes and i also want to leave this city 
 whacking 
 the problem is i dont happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people 
 now whats the problem 
 he wants to know who you are your name i told him we dont need to know anything about you 
 what was that 
 its not a joke 
 doesnt surprise me i meet a lot of people like that 
 you dont understand we have nothing to do with your laws 
 yes i do your son is a material witness to a homicide 
 you have no right to keep us here 
 we are looking for a suspect we have reason to believe hes still in the area 
 where are you taking us 
 there will be another train the man who was killed tonight was a policeman sam its my job to find out who did it i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there 
 samuel samuel lapp but what happened here is none of his affair my sister is expecting me our train is leaving soon 
 im a police officer im going to have to talk to the boy whats his name

 elaine i have come to apologize for lt mcelroy he overstated the departments position 
 not yet 
 did you find him

 so isnt it time you unwrapped your present 
 i love christmas in turkey 
 we cant 
 weve got to get out 
 count to twenty ill be there 
 but what if 
 count to twenty when you get to twenty open the hatch it can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink 
 just wanted to put him on edge 
 what kind of bikes did you ride 
 like riding a bike 
 do you know what youre doing 
 hes going to insert the plutonium 
 hes sealed himself in 
 we go down to the torpedo bay 
 is there another way 
 if i dont get to the boa before he gets to maidens tower m is dead 
 zukovsky 
 elektra would control it all 
 the king pipeline 
 because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world 
 but why eight million people would die the land irradiated for a hundred years a cloud of radiation the size of europe 
 made to look just like an accident 
 not just nuclear powered by a nuclear reactor hes not loading any cargo they want the sub the sub itself put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor instant catastrophic meltdown 
 nuclear 
 she just upped the stakes all her chips are on the table now and ms life is part of the bet 
 what is it 
 i was hoping you could tell me 
 what would she want with weapons grade plutonium 
 makes her look even more innocent 
 elektra king are you insane this is her pipeline 
 elektra king 
 whos she 
 its part of some plan she dresses it up like a terrorist attack the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium 
 what the hell are you talking about 
 i did kill us she thinks were dead and she thinks she got away with it 
 what the hell were you doing you nearly killed us 
 its a bomb alright were still dead if the trigger charge goes off 
 then its no longer a bomb 
 the plutonium is missing theyve taken the core 
 alright then brunch 
 when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens 
 when this is over we should bury the hatchet celebrate a champagne dinner 
 with this 
 they wont get far every warhead has a locator card a miratom device emits a highpitched signal on russian emergency frequencies we can track the bomb 
 bond 
 so who are you 
 shame you had to spot i wasnt the real thing 
 heres your imposter hes paid off the men on the plane outside theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility theyre flying it wherever he tells them 
 he is an impostor theres no davidov at miratom 
 the soldiers may give you a hard time whatever if we werent around theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides rotting in the sun 
 couldnt make it splitting headache 
 what happened to len tashka 
 dont know any doctor jokes 
 doctor jones christmas jones no jokes ive heard them all 
 yes viktor davidov miss 
 you new 
 i could come for a second opinion 
 yes 
 perhaps after this test 
 then maybe id be open to that 
 james it wouldnt really be 
 its just a scratch 
 i need you to pass me fit now molly 
 dislocated collar bone if any more tendons snap it wont just be two weeks out of action 
 is maybethe inside woman 
 the inside man 
 theyre getting their weapons from the russians but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons i cant help thinkingthe person close to king the one who switched that pin 
 then robert was right about a russian connection 
 the report king bought its a manual renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead 
 the worm on the hook again 
 get out to the pipeline find the insider who switched the pin if your instincts are right renard will be back he hasnt completed the job the pipeline is still going forward and we have elektra to thank for that 
 hes not through yet renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in hes working for someone someone who wants to stop the pipeline and they hired the perfect killer one with a vendetta against kingand you 
 now robert is dead he got his revenge 
 that which does not kill me makes me stronger 
 the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata killing off his sense of touch he feels no pain he can push himself harder longer than any normal man 
 the doctor who saved him couldnt get it out so renard killed him when interpol found the xrays there was mild jubilation effectively hes a dead man 
 he survived 
 how many deaths is he responsible for how many innocent people you may only get one shot at a man like renard same circumstances id do the same again 
 sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist 
 sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his ownresources at first when elektras ear was delivered to him in the post he came to me i advised against paying the ransom i knew it was renard i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him 
 renard 
 claude serrault aka 
 who 
 its a message he wants us to know hes back 
 the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra 
 im well aware of your stake in this N if you have a point get to it 
 i was the one who brought that money in 
 you havent been given an assignment in this case 
 i took the initiative 
 who told you to look at elektras files 
 and now its up for grabs a goldrush far more oil than anyone thought 
 caviar capital of the world matchless beluga firm yet subtle largest landlocked body of water on earth oilrich hitler wanted it stalin beat him to it 
 N what do you know of the caspian sea 
 well at least it turned out to have some purpose 
 its barely a scratch the dome broke my fall 
 ive scheduled a medical for you 
 shes not a girl anymore 
 elektra running king industries ive known that girl all her life im not sure she knows what shes walking into 
 who buys classified reports for three million pounds 
 since oxford i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world hes a man of great integrity 
 old friend 
 quite the opposite in fact 
 constructions not exactly my line 
 i cant tell you alright alright but you must protect me 
 the name 
 stripped of all your weaponry you still threaten me 
 your last chance give me the name 
 your last chance take the money 
 and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss 
 i am just a middle man i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner 
 who did you get it from 
 i did not get the report from an miN agent 
 which is neutral no doubt 
 not the usual swiss procedure mr bond but you understand a man in my position 
 havent you heard the news so is she 
 in case youve forgotten im dead already 
 you even brought the plane for us we really couldnt have done it without you 
 shell get over it 
 its i who should thank you for taking that money back to miN so distressing for m an explosion inside her lair 
 consider me ungrateful 
 have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva 
 you will never touch her you will never get near her 
 you think i fear death i welcome it i get on my knees and pray for it you on the other hand you have something to live for no shes beautiful isnt she you should have seen her before flawless and still so innocent not such a whore in bed 
 who is it 
 not many people in this world have that kind of fortune 
 revenge isnt so hard to fathom whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it 
 indeed 
 i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty 
 he died before he could complete his lifelong dream i intend to finish it for him 
 im sorry 
 he was my father 
 you knew him well 
 a word im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover 
 perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs 
 today of all days the sun decides to shine 
 yes 
 beautiful isnt it 
 oh james 
 one last screw 
 elektra its not too late eight million people neednt die 
 know what happens when a man is strangled 
 noone will believe this meltdown was an accident 
 it runs in my veins thicker than blood im going to redraw the map and when i am through the whole world will know my name my grandfathers name the glory of my people 
 it is my oil mine and my familys 
 was this all about the oil 
 he killed me he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom 
 so you killed your father 
 just like youonly you were even easier 
 you turned renard 
 since i was a child ive always had a power over men when i realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers i knew i had to form a new alliance 
 five more turns and your neck will break 
 all this because you fell for renard 
 soon shell be everywhere 
 wheres m 
 not interested 
 i could have given you the world 
 you do what you have to do but ive called in m shes en route from london even now 
 im coming with you 
 you knew you knew all the time that he was out there that he was coming for me and you lied you used me you used me as bait you made love to me what to pass the time as you waited for him to strike 
 he used your exact words 
 how dare you how dare you that animal that monster he disgusts me you disgust me so he knew where to hurt you is that it you had a sling on your arm at the funeral i didnt have to sleep with you to find that out 
 i think you do 
 i dont know what youre talking about 
 you can drop the act its over 
 are you sayingrenard is the man whos trying to kill me 
 we had a runin he and i he knew about us he knew about my shoulder he knew exactly where to hurt me 
 what 
 or did you steal it from your old friend renard 
 what are you talking about 
 a little does it matter after all whats the point of living if you cant feel alive isnt that right elektra isnt that your motto 
 whats wrong with you are you crazy 
 i used my body on the guards it gave me control i got to a gun and i took my chance ive never told anyone that 
 how did you survive 
 shush 
 you knew when you first saw me you knew it would be like this 
 not at that price time to surrender 
 surely you believe in living dangerously 
 really 
 i understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end 
 you had your chance james now im looking for a bigger thrill 
 if this little show is for my benefit ill take you home right now 
 someone wants to kill me id rather die looking him straight in the eye what are you doing here looking for a woman a little more your type how about that one 
 what the hell are you doing here 
 two shaken not stirred 
 vodka martini 
 i have to go to work 
 i dont want to be safe 
 no youll be safe here 
 then take me with you 
 i have to go 
 james 
 you should rest 
 what is it 
 i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met 
 the way i acted in the snowyou must think im a coward 
 i know 
 i cant stay 
 its the only way out 
 no it will cave in 
 youre not going to 
 i cant stay here 
 were alright 
 oh my godwere buried alive 
 no 
 you dont take no for an answer do you 
 always wanted to see the upper lines 
 i have to check the upper lines gabor will drive you back 
 you are wrong mr bond in fact i am the only person who can do it 
 i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone especially kings daughter 
 thats every man within a five mile radius including you thats why youre here isnt it you think i cant do it you think im going to screw up or get myself killed 
 the killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue doesnt want to see you take over 
 if youve come here to look after me mr bond thank you but no thank you i have two bodyguards i dont need a third 
 its not the pin your father wore its an exact duplicate inside is a tiny electrical detonator we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice someone who worked at this company 
 are you trying to break my heart or is it just your way with women 
 its my fathers pin he wore it everyday of his life 
 does this look familiar to you 
 since the kidnapping why do you ask 
 how long has he been with you 
 my bodyguard he follows me everywhere hes decisive vigilant and he makes an excellent omelette 
 who is he 
 partially yes 
 is that why you want to finish the pipeline 
 god no all those horrible loved ones and relatives i dont want to talk to those people i just want totalk to my father i loved him im not sure he knew that 
 funerals arent exactly memorable 
 i havent been able to recall a single moment of that dayuntil now 
 yes 
 i met you at my fathers funeral 
 id heard there were some renovations thereno one would look for a sub in that place in a million years 
 how appropriate 
 the maidens tower 
 the right kind of explosion in the right spot it would block the bosphorus cut off the black sea 
 mother of god 
 istanbul 
 where 
 so my way no miN no interpol just you me and my people 
 this is a family matter if my nephew is in danger we do it my way or nothing now get me out 
 this is too big for even you where is it 
 no get me out 
 wheres the sub going 
 a special job aaa submarine 
 and the payoff on the tables 
 alright alright sometimes i smuggle machinery for her russian stuff 
 no the truth she thought i was dead those blades were meant for you what do you know that she would kill you for 
 a rope 
 nowwhere were we 
 you are out of your league shes working with renard 
 that is N dollars of beluga ruined 
 as ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks 
 she dropped a million and half dollars to the house your house and you didnt even bat an eyelid she was paying you off what for 
 i thought you were the one in her business 
 whats your business with elektra king 
 really bond couldnt you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears 
 ah i see a purelyplutonic relationship 
 shes no innocent this is my nuclear consultant 
 what are doing bond trying to impress this innocent thing 
 but you would have something to gain by killing robert king and stopping his pipeline 
 bond if someone wants you dead it is renard our government has nothing to gain by killing you 
 how high up does thisarms dealing go 
 that too everyone does what they can to survive 
 off a highpowered paraski that was trying to kill me 
 where did you get this 
 if i remember my cyrillic that says N st airborne division 
 what this is not possible 
 how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with stateoftheart russian army weapons 
 see youre upsetting my customers what do you want 
 have some of the rats nest caviar from my own fishery they buy my caviar drink my champagne lose to my house 
 mafia warlords diplomats and spies consortiums from every country in the world a nice little rats nest 
 bond im a civilian this is my place used to be the royal familys now its mine i run my little business i stay out of trouble 
 you of course i need some information 
 bondjamesbond what brings you here 
 valentin zukovsky 
 cclass 
 what class sub does your nephew run 
 in the good old days the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo 
 former kgb surveillance post the dye factory was just a front now it turns a good profit 
 what is this place 
 bond 
 no bond 
 to haul some cargo my nephew he is captain of a sub in the black sea fleet 
 what

 is nothing his kingdom he stole from my mother the kingdom i will rightly take back 
 your father 
 your people your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me you and my father he didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market

 what about the aftermath this socalled nuclear winter theory 
 as you can see we may be able to salvage a goodsized chunk of the farm belt 
 thirty minutes maximum of course i assume wed be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order 
 what kind of time frame are we talking about 
 well sir in a worstcase scenario wed assume that twentyfive percent of the russian birds get through 
 what about our end 
 they want in seems our friend here was hardcore ctu 
 washington

 no needles huh what about the acid bath

 oh yeah why dont we start by taking this thing off my ankle the poison needles 
 you know what they say the only way to change the system is from the inside 
 who says you are the good guys

 somebody else makes those decisions not guys like you and me you have done your job x head back to prague i will be landing in N minutes this is my operation now 
 kinda funny though isnt it we are not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway guess we shoulda played by the rules 
 yeah thats right so now that you know you understand why its important that we get it back 
 jesus christ gibbons this is something we came up with 
 silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated the black and white chemicals mix forming a toxic cloud when it settles down to earth it will kill everything in the vicinity 
 come on gibbons you can do better then that 
 yes it does 
 they retrofitted ahab with some kind of rocket launcher they were loading canisters of liquid into it light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate something tells me this it that classified stuff you didnt want me to know about does the song silent night mean anything to you 
 im on the way with a team to relieve you whats the latest 
 snow covered fortress army of bad guys the usual 
 you aint seen nothing yet 
 you are a grungy little phoenix you know that keep up the good work 
 thanks 
 im gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives and x you done yourself proud helping those people today 
 hey one miracle at a time they are on to me now remember 
 this is good work x damn fine work you need to press on at all costs find out what they have planned with this ahab 
 yeah i sent you pictures heres what im thinking if they take out the cameras and sensors they could probably put a bomb in this thing you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later its swimming up the potomac 
 you did say ahab you are sure about that 
 i know poison needles in my shins you have got N hours peace out 
 my friend if you are planning on crossing me 
 call me crazy but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side what else you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too 
 that information is classified you are there to gather information on their operations period 
 what the hell am i after you are telling me dick 
 we are not after car thieves here 
 im already on a first name basis with these dudes i got a deal set up you want me to hammer it or not 
 one point two million dollars i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars 
 buddy you sent me here to get close to their organization that costs money 
 if you are trying to push my buttons you are on the right track dont make me question my own judgment x 
 i guess you got my email i set up a purchase ten cars 
 just remember i will be watching 
 is that all 
 crude and defiant as always triple x it fits so well because you are obscene 
 up yours 
 fine but im not gonna be no bulldog omega N 
 i expect you to call in regularly with progress reports 
 yeah i spy or i die 
 wherever you go on the planet i will find you theres no quitting if you try to take it off a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground is all that clear 
 how about a pedicure as long as you are down there whats this lojack 
 whats with that x on the back of your head does that mean you are extreme i have got some news for you mr x you are a three time loser so maybe you should tattoo another couple of xs on your head 
 not bad for a gimp 
 you are one sick bastard a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission i think no matter which way i go im likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic so heres my answer kiss my ass hopalong 
 if you find out what i want to know and if im able to successfully use that information you get to go back to your degenerate little life if not you take a bath 
 what do i get out of it 
 theres some folks i want to keep tabs on dirty tattooed uncivilized your kind of people 
 now im the one whos nauseous so whats the deal what do you need me for 
 thats too bad i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge 
 i plan on getting a lot older and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead 
 you are an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you are not getting any younger 
 im not interested i have already got a job 
 you are perceptive too i forgot to add that to the list of surprises im with the national security agency and unlikely as it may sound i need your help 
 you want the cheap backstory the runaway mom the suicide dad and the foster homes gimme a break you are not interested in my past you are interested in my future as some kind of spy 
 you have really got me confused cage on the one hand you showed leadership courage under fire a willingness to protect men you hardly knew and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic help me out here im not following your evolution 
 good thing you were there to save the day come walk with me 
 you are a cold piece of work you almost got three people killed out there 
 congratulations you have just graduated at the head of your class 
 you know what i hate its always the assholes that pass the tests 
 you know what i hate any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they are god 
 sure as gravity i have had a feeling about you from the start cage its nausea 
 is that a fact 
 you have got this wrong you are not under arrest you have been abducted and until i say different you belong to me 
 are we done now you have got nothing on me so if you aint booking me im walking 
 oh i dont know i think the tests work pretty well sometimes they give me answers you wouldnt admit to in a million years 
 look at me dude do i look like a fan of law enforcement forget the tests you shoulda just asked me i woulda saved you a lot of trouble 
 why is that 
 if you are trolling around for narcs man have you got the wrong guy 
 alright cage you have got me this is one of those moments many are called few are chosen that kind of thing your government needs you are you up for the challenge 
 a fed i shoulda known who else would have this kind of budget now you are gonna hit me with the sales pitch 
 its your lucky day you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy 
 good for you now why dont you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want you didnt go through all this for my benefit 
 whether you thought this was for real or not you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct that tells me something about your character 
 that shows me already that you dont have a clue whats it to you anyway 
 most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place i expected you to do the same 
 diner huh let me tell you what the problem is i wake up drugged to find what you have got a salesman over here reading a three week old newspaper hes pulling a N with a trucker who happens to be packing a cop issue h and k N mm i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note hows that for twisted logic how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i walked in and if thats true whyd they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money then i notice how beefy they both are hell even the waitress is cut all three of them look like they went through the same training program ergo they aint strangers and this isnt what it seems thats how i knew yoyo wouldnt get a round off even if i gave him all day why 
 looks like a diner 
 what is this place 
 the names gibbons you were saying 
 who the hell are you 
 so the odds are up to fiftyfifty i can deal with that 
 alright do what you want but keep the screws on him hes a wild card that could be either good or bad 
 why not you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid werent you 
 hes gotten closer in N hours than all of the other operatives combined he got us an account number to boot now even if hes just dumb and lucky i say we back his play i put him out there sam if he doesnt come up with the money they will kill him i cant let that happen 
 you are talking about a very expensive risk here 
 if it means getting silent night back absolutely 
 you what a wire transfer of this size 
 i think we should send him whatever he wants 
 ridiculous cut him off im sorry gibbons you pulled up a shark this time 
 thats exactly why we need them 
 they are degenerates theres not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over 
 i have seen enough turn it off 
 but programmable and expendable 
 the scum of the earth 
 the usual prospects convicts contract killers murde 
 you wanna find out about rats ask a rat i have had my people put together a talent pool i downloaded it to your desktop 
 so you will dredge the bottom again you have done that before the results were uneven 
 i will go in with a team but first im going to need some intel i will have to put someone inside someone new someone they wont see coming one of their own 
 how will you fix it 
 we are gonna have to step in sam those cia boys couldnt find a clown in a field of cactus let me take care of it 
 silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys 
 they are ruthless and they have a lot of firepower its only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night then we are gonna have a catastrophe on our hands 
 he was the best there was that makes three agents lost 
 not a whole helluva lot his final transmission was mangled about something or someone called ahab whatever it is it cost him his life 
 what do you have 
 now you are gonna make me enjoy this funny guy now im gonna take the whole foot off whatchu think of that 
 alright you wanna eat through a tube be my guest 
 you saving me you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling 
 we are on to the game ese you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls you got your torture tools its all very cute but come on lets quit while you are ahead im only trying to save you a beatin 
 we are antisocial we dont have any friends 
 we seen this kind of parachutes before you know us army you got some friends here jump out with you guys 
 thats some accident hombre you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard 
 oh i dont know it was an accident 
 whatchu doing here 
 he gets to be the hero 
 like what 
 oh i bet by the end he gets something out of it 
 nothing really my guy is just doing it to stay alive 
 what do you get if you finish 
 just about anything i want it looks like this is gonna be tough though theres no way to save this game i gotta get it right the first time through 
 what weapons do you have 
 what are you gonna do they are euro trash 
 anarchy N 
 yorgi masterminded the takeover of three red mafiya clans cops called it blood week he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate anarchy N 
 kirill the sniper looks like a bookworm but he had N confirmed kills in chechnya they called him the finger of god assassination and weapons 
 this guys kinda dorky lookin 
 naturally 
 next we got a siberian redneck viktor into snowmobiles and snowboarding so naturally he covers prostitution and the drug trade 
 you wanna check it out come here 
 do they have any special powers the bosses always have special powers 
 slick graphics huh see these dudes they are called anarchy N they are the bad guy bosses 
 what game is that 
 its about your next mission you need to be debriefed 
 what are you doing 
 you cant welch on me now we had a deal 
 i cant believe my mission is finally over i dont even know what to do with myself 
 use your grenades maybe we can blow it up underwater 
 by then its too late the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water the chemicals will break down and dissipate 
 it has to surface to release the nerve agent right 
 its running three meters down twenty knots 
 a manual control on a moving torpedo this day keeps getting better and better 
 no its like a safety we are going to have to access the manual controls 
 you cant talk to it 
 hes shut out the communication circuit 
 im sick of that guy lets stop playing nice 
 a piece of shrapnel hit me 
 you okay 
 let me 
 toadies right behind 
 go to the water its that way 
 whered the damn truck go 
 he owns a big industrial complex on the river he will launch it from there 
 wheres he headed 
 lets do this 
 if they launch it i know how to bring it back 
 did you do your homework 
 let me guess they had a big white torpedo with them 
 yorgi and kirill 
 hes a regular humanitarian and all this time i thought he was just a tool 
 dont you see x for the betterment of humanity hes going to start world war three 
 what the hell are we doing we are doing all this together trusting each other making plans and we havent even slept together yet 
 when this is over we are just gonna take off the two of us take a vacation 
 i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop they will believe me i have been lying for so long one more time wont hurt 
 arent they gonna wonder were you have been 
 yes i do you are right i cant just let him go free besides i can help you from the inside 
 you dont have to do that 
 i must be healthy then because im scared to death i guess id better get back to yorgi 
 a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head maybe thats my problem if you dont feel fear you can do some amazing things but you can also screw your life up in ways you cant imagine 
 arent you afraid 
 we will have to go after them 
 they left to a fortress in the mountains 
 why you are the one who believes in nothing screw the world or whatever you said 
 we cant leave now we have to do something 
 no now its about us lets do something for us before we both get killed dont you want to get to bora bora xander 
 petra this aint about the people that sent us here you know that 
 what do we owe our governments yours kidnapped you mine abandoned me 
 of course it matters hey hold on 
 it doesnt matter anymore forget it 
 wait a minute whoa we cant go now whats yorgi got planned with that nerve agent

 where are we going 
 i know which cops are good and which are bad come with me come on right now 
 what are you doing with the ivans 
 i dont know whats going on anymore i thought i was square with that dude now everybodys switching sides like its the wwf 
 i heard you talking i could tell where you were in the room 
 what the hell are you doing you could have killed me

 you cant its too risky im not much help anyway remember 
 when can i see you again 
 of course i will do what i can i have to go before they notice 
 get your head back in the game there are lives at stake here 
 no i guess i have been no help at all to you 
 im busted up for you but jesus what the hell are you doing those people almost drowned on that boat and you didnt lift a finger 
 i dont know eight months ago i stop hearing from my people no explanation just silence so i stay and i wait like i was told soon im in so far theyd kill me if i left now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was im like you said a criminal 
 you are what what the hell have you been doing 
 im a agent as well kgb i have been undercover for over a year 
 whats that 
 theres something i didnt have time to tell you before 
 we have got to find out what it is can you handle that 
 no something worse he says its a surprise but i know him this is his masterpiece 
 so whats the plan with this ahab are they selling it or what 
 they will kill you you know they will besides there is no back door keep smiling ready now 
 i cant let this happen i want you to go out the back i will make up some excuse 
 not an option just get up slowly like everythings cool petra trust me you just hung yourself out to dry for me im not gonna let you down 
 thats alright i will figure something out 
 if i go out the back he will know you have warned me 
 jesus christ you are going to have to go out the back the data that you copied with your toy tomorrow at six oclock look it up we are taking a trip be there at six and you will have plenty to tell your people 
 its a long story but yeah more or less 
 theres no more time for games they made you theres a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye tell me if its true 
 what are you talking about 
 they tell me you are an american agent 
 so there you have it i guess you just have to ask yourself how bad to you want out

 we could work together then maybe we could both get the hell out of here theres a beach in bora bora with my name on it 
 all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts 
 the people i know want facts the kinds of things an insider would know they are interested in putting anarchy N out of business 
 dont even start i will be honest i dont trust you bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true that i want to leave what can you do about it 
 i know where hes coming from the only thing i really dont get is why he dumped you up until i found that out i thought his judgment was pretty sound 
 you agree with a lot of what he says dont you 
 dont judge a comic book by its cover 
 whoever sent you knew what they were doing you and yorgi are practically twins two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but dont say much 
 lets just say im freelancing and leave it at that 
 so why dont you tell me something about who you gather information for they obviously have very deep pockets are you from a rival clan 
 im from la 
 thats how you eat its like a gerbil 
 im an information gatherer you wanna go somewhere and talk about it

 you both could have been a part of it you could have ridden with us into a new day the dawning of a new age of 
 come on xander you used to stand for something what happened to you man i thought youd get it 
 and here i thought anarchy was just something cool to put on a tshirt 
 sure if thats what you want why not its all human nature so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it 
 including rape pillage murder 
 easier than that buddy i will get them to destroy each other you kill an entire peace conference someone is going to have to pay then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour london cairo beijing pretty soon everyones involved these guys bomb those guys those guys invade these guys soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days no rules no law everybody free to do what they want 
 so all by yourself you are going to destroy every government in the world 
 you think im after money i told you my friend anarchy time for a change money is good but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves 
 whats the gimmick yorgi thats the part i dont get you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs i didnt think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche 
 not bad man not bad you put things together quick prague it is 
 i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls

 you got a great setup here yorgi you really know how to live 
 easy you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss 
 how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere 
 you got it man its stupid but its true true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want thats when you know you are living man 
 try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese anarchy burger by the vandals 
 to us it means no walls no speed limits no jails its everybody does what he wants people think democracy is freedom but they dont have a clue theres an old punk song it says america stands for freedom but if you think you are free 
 thats what im talking about man thats why anarchy N was born 
 screw the world if im gonna die for something it better be bitches and money 
 you wanna see my politics 
 its all this craziness its what we have been living since N when we left the army one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit what for he dies for what politics whos politics not ours

 ferraris lamborghinis high end pasta rockets ten to start

 he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink 
 cops like a plague no matter how many you pay theres always another with his hand out how did you pick him out 
 who you workin for what do you do for a living dickhead 
 this pizda never seen him before 
 thats the guy 
 beast 
 storm try to look for the highest vantage point from what i can figure he will need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island it is my feeling that magneto has to 
 we all do 
 i wish i could go 
 until he found tungsten 
 thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb he had the energy source he had the vacuum but he didnt have the filament he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power 
 the neurofilter acts like a surge protector regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professors mind its what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions 
 what does that mean 
 so where do you think hes planning this larger demonstration 
 yes only theres a problem the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature its forcing the bodys cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they are accustomed to the senators body is literally burning itself out scott this machine kills people and i dont think magneto realizes it 
 for what purpose 
 correct apparently adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces he used the adamantium in logans dog tag to test it on the senator and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logans skeleton for a larger demonstration 
 its core 
 it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings and he is using adamantium as its core 
 im afraid without cerebros help he wont have the strength to heal himself and without the neuro filter theres no cerebro 
 can the professor repair his own mind 
 im sorry im not strong enough 
 jean can you 
 storm rogue you take the south entrance jean and i will go in here 
 its too far 
 im going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission jean can you raise me up there 
 uhhuh 
 into the hudson 
 radar stealth mode checks out all right there will be less security north of the george washington bridge im taking her down 
 he calls me sport one more time and i will blow a watermelonsized hole through him 
 whats that 
 i will tell you one thing though 
 well i think thats perfectly understandable 
 hey im sorry about logan i was jealous 
 no im i dont know if we can do this without charles 
 are you all right 
 we have to find magneto 
 hes already losing control of his vitals respiratory cardiovascular unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning im afraid 
 his vital signs are weak and getting weaker 
 whats wrong with him 
 if magneto is planning to use logan for some terrible purpose its our responsibility to do something 
 you saw what happened tonight you think magneto wont come after him again you think he wont come here if necessary this is a school for gods sake 
 what are you talking about 
 i dont like him being here 
 scott i 
 sure you are sport 
 im ok im ok 
 shut up i got no interest in you xavier or your xmen 
 you know you 
 i have served with men like you before methodical systematic naive you know what happens to those men in a real fight 
 i dont remember is that what you wanted to ask me 
 how long have you been in alaska 
 i wanted to talk to you 
 inspiring now what am i doing here 
 yeah i will bet you have 
 i have seen a lot of rings 
 logan do you see this ring 
 what is it you are failing to get at are you interested in me 
 he takes himself seriously 
 he takes his work seriously 
 hes uptight 
 suit yourself 
 let go 
 not interested 
 what do you say 
 were you now 
 i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town 
 hes busy right now 
 you should always work with a spotter 
 what if they are naughty 
 if necessary 
 by reading my thoughts 
 maybe the professor could help you with that 
 yeah well i dont like to talk about my past 
 the professor said you were a solider actually i believe he used the word mercenary 
 what if i like the pain 
 i will see what i can do you should get some sleep even with your healing ability you are going to be hurting for a while 
 i wont light the cigars how about that 
 theres no smoking or drinking on the school grounds 
 some cigars case of beer 
 anything else i can get you 
 i can assure you there is no such creature in my genes 
 the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change 
 tell it to the ones that did this to me 
 treat you like a mutant we are not what you think not all of us 
 im sorry to come here ms grey i was afraid if i went to a hospital they would 
 senator 
 dr grey 
 i can assure you there is no such creature in my genes 
 i presume nothing i am here to tell you that in time the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet perhaps even your children senator 
 this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus new jersey a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him i dont know where you come from ms grey but where i come from you dont go melting peoples cars when they cut you off you do it the old fashioned way you give em the finger but what you presume to tell this committee 
 control senator we teach them control 
 you wouldnt happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to 
 math history science english athletics 
 ms grey you work at a school for mutants in westchester new york can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants 
 i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded senator the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous 
 you are avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing ms grey three words are mutants dangerous 
 lets just say god works too slowly 
 what is it you intend to do to me 
 intention intention senator we are talking about mankind here his fear it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps studied for weaknesses and eventually wiped off the face of the earth 
 the intention of registration act 
 gosh i hope so 
 whatever you do to me no matter what you will make me right every word i have spoken will be confirmed 
 you mutant bastards 
 mr guyrich has been dead for some time senator 
 you wha who are you where is henry 
 in the road to survival there is always sacrifice logan we are the future not them we must protect ourselves after tonight when the leaders of the world return home they will return as brothers as mutants and our cause will be theirs this is survival i know you understand that logan or is it wolverine 
 what are you going to do 
 you are backstage at the encore of creation 
 where am i 
 you think i care about her im the only one whos sure to walk out of here 
 come with me and i will let her live 
 what do you want 
 i do love a good check mate 
 what miss me charley im gonna walk out the front door and trust me it wont be soon enough for everyone here 
 why you have a home here now if you want it everyone will 
 actually im feeling up to leaving 
 they are all asking how you are doing are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone 
 dont you knock 
 i will go 
 i have found her westchester mall 
 we were friends once but that was a long time ago 
 he helped you 
 actually magneto helped me put it together 
 you designed this yourself 
 the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being 
 how 
 to find rogue 
 where are we going 
 i believe he wants you for your adamantium 
 no thats me talking and you know what its only been thirtytwo hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me 
 now thats magneto talking 
 what if it never happens what if they are so afraid of us that we become the enemy this place is gonna be one giant cemetery 
 the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings 
 this this whole god damn thing making yourselves into some sort of team of superpowered freaks teaching wayward mutants about classical literature for what 
 the point of what 
 deal 
 fortyeight hours old man but if you cross me i wont feel any guilt about what i do to you 
 a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you im not sure why but until we find out i must ask you to stay 
 who 
 i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto 
 what am i doing here 
 and you think it helps calling her rogue 
 if she held on any longer she could have 
 i felt like she almost killed me 
 she borrowed your power to save her life when she touches someone she absorbs their strengths their gifts in your case your ability to heal thats why she keeps her body covered 
 what did she do to me 
 the sun is setting logan you have been asleep for nineteen hours 
 why is everybody up at sunrise 
 alive 
 i will find him 
 enough for a test 
 is it enough 
 a piece only a piece 
 is that what you are looking for 
 it was xaviers people they knew 
 how 
 i lost him 
 i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble 
 and what do you do when you wake up to that 
 it does indeed max 
 doesnt it ever wake you in the middle of the night the feeling that some day some day very soon they will pass that foolish law or one just like it and they will come for you and your children take you all away 
 i know 
 i wouldnt really have let you die you know i just needed 
 what do you mean to do 
 this checkmate goes to you i didnt want to hurt anyone but you leave me no choice 
 what do you mean to do 
 im going to change the world with or without you as a witness charles and this one gets a front row seat 
 the way what is going to be 
 if i could make you understand if you could just be made to see it the way i do the way its going to be 
 lets just say that i am out to make some radical changes now come on charles for old times sake for your sake leave him to me 
 you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me max what is it like these days 
 still trying to make the world safe for our kind still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves definitively 
 is that so 
 what do you want with him 
 the two in alaska just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time still tinkering with cerebro 
 not at the cost of lives max 
 i am trying to save our kind charles you should do the same 
 and i will never understand terrorists 
 i will never understand your regard for them charles 
 herr falkstein you must go at once and present dr frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance the estate will provide for your journey 
 oh shit 
 he is the fifth leading authority in his field 
 and has he achievedany special degree of eminence 
 yes my dear he is 
 excuse me mr waldman excuse me for interrupting but is frederick thena medical doctor 
 now wait a minute 
 i think we all need a good nights sleep why dont we meet next week and thrash this thing out 
 poppycock 
 they say also that you have recreated the horrible monster who for so many years has haunted and terrorized the godfearing people of this village what say you to that 
 ugly vicious rumous

 yes sir 
 yes sir

 here this cauliflower is useless to me 
 no sir it will never happen again

 i have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executedand by god it shall be done 
 yes sir 
 herr falkstein you have your instructions 
 functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull 
 what lecture could be more important than the will of baron beaufort frankenstein 
 yes sir he was but he said he was obligated to lecture at johns hopkins university 
 was he aware of the importance of this occasion 
 but i received a cable only this morning saying that he could not come 
 i did sir

 good 
 i put her in the guest room just down the hall 
 i dont think so is my assistant taken care of 
 will there be anything else 
 well we will see 
 i think you must be mistaken sir 
 surely he kept his notes his private papers and records in some other place 
 this is the only library i know of 
 well there was a public and a private library he said so in his will these books are all very general any doctor might have them in his study 
 i dont know what you mean sir 
 i see and where is my grandfathers private library 
 yes this was victors the barons medical library 
 there seem to be quite a few books 
 may i have it please 
 no dr frankenstein always kept that separate 
 yes the laboratory 
 you mean the laboratory 
 does that include the key to the laboratory 
 you will fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas all the rooms in your castle on this ring i will leave it on the table here 
 it seems fine 
 i hope you find this comfortable this was baron victors room 
 saturday night yes sir have a pleasant journey 
 saturday night then i will take the train to new york and fly from there 
 not at all a great privilege doctor 
 well thank you very much for all your trouble 
 one week i will see to it sir 
 one week at the most 
 yes sir 
 all right then i suppose i owe the family that much you will have everything ready for me when i arrive 
 the old violinist you smashed his violin over your knee 
 i didnt do that 
 break that old mans violin 
 what 
 why did you do that 
 well if you are sure that i could accomplish everything in a week i suppose i could manage it 
 i will have to think it over its not so easy just to pick up and 
 a week ten days at most 
 how long will this whole thing take 
 do you have a hundred thousand of them sir 
 but i cant just drop everything and leave i have responsibilities and obligations 
 oh at least sir the land alone is worth a small fortune 
 my name is gerhart falkstein 
 fron kon steen 
 dr frankenstein 
 my grandfathers work was doodoo dead is dead theres only one thing i am interested in and that is the preservation of life 
 but your grandfathers work sir 
 you have more chance of reanimating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system 
 i am a scientist not a philosopher 
 but sir 
 hearts and kidneys are tinker toys im talking about the central nervous system 
 but look at whats been done with hearts and kidneys 
 nineteen my dear young man once the human organism has ceased to function nature has deemed that creature to be dead 
 nineteen sir 
 how old are you young man 
 yes but sir if it could be accomplished wouldnt that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death 
 you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind 
 but arent you the least bit curious about it doctor doesnt the secret of life hold any intrigue for you 
 my father was a sick man 
 but wasnt that the whole basis of your grandfathers work sir the reanimation of component parts 
 are you speaking of the worm or the spaghetti 
 vermicelli 
 a piece of what 
 isnt it true that darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until by some extraordinary means it actually began to move with voluntary motion 
 yes 
 dr fronkonsteen 
 in conclusion it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious because once a nerve fibber is severed there is no way to regenerate life back into it are there any more questions before we leave 
 very good since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction why dont we proceed 
 well sir im not sure i understand the distinction between areflexive and voluntary nerve impulses 
 i prefer by far to be remembered for my own small contributions to science now if we can proceed to your questions 
 thats true but my grandfather victor was after all what we might politely refer to as a cuckoo 
 but arent you the grandson of the famous dr victor frankenstein who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism 
 no its dr fronkonsteen 
 oh i thought it was dr frankenstein 
 my name is pronounced fron kon steen 
 i beg your pardon 
 thats fronkonsteen 
 okay boss but i hope you know what you are doing 
 its the only way 
 yes master are you sure you want to go through with it 
 is everything ready 
 come on big fellow 
 i will bet its a doozy 
 theres only one way 
 i like your style master how do we get him here 
 and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid 
 that sound good boss 
 no the only hope now is to get him back here if i can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum 
 hes carrying her off now through the woods 
 what 
 you dont understand master the big fellows broken in and kidnapped your fiancee 
 what dya mean what monster you rememberthe one we madein the basement 
 what monster 
 come on froderick none of that 
 im a failure 
 thats what we are paid for 
 thanksfor all your help 
 maybeif you get here on time 
 can you play it 
 bring me the violin 
 how do you know it was a she 
 all right where is she 
 how do you know it was a he

 dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals 
 and look at this doctor

 food 
 yes sir name please 
 zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don t mean to say they got no brains they will watch us and wait and find our weaknesses 
 why don t the zulus attack 
 one zulu is only one man and im afeared of no one man but the zulu they come in the thousands like a black wave of death in the thousands and them assegais stabbing 
 you afeared of the zulus then quartermaster 
 could be across the river into zululand they might just be waiting there for us to show up them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies 
 will we be fighting the zulus soo~ quartermaster 
 so you got it in the line of dooty point taken 
 from the cook sir they saw me dip your shaving tin in the teawater this morning made their tea taste of lifebuoy toilet soap they saij handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier N t 
 i listened extra careful to your stand to this mornin boy ft was peifecl i couldnt have done it better meseif not even when i was bugler to the duke of wellington now tell me where did you get that black eye 
 will you hear last post sir 
 our friend colonel dumford will be should be at this minute approaching pulleine i think we will eat here i want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour 
 eleven oclock my lorj N 
 what oclock is it mr noggs 
 my only fear is that the zulu will avoid the engagement 
 so attack is your defence well lets hope cetshwayo will offer his impis full destruction 
 do not confuse yourse{fi why we must strike a heavy blow this cannot be a war of manoeuvre 
 if i have got it right my lord you lead an invasion into zululand for i see it all around me but why is the question my readers will ask why 
 tell what you see write it well sir and make sure you get it right 
 they spurred onto high ground my lord full of spirit and looking for the zulu full of sport they were my lord 
 were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory 
 indeedldid mylord itwas one ofthe first to cross 
 N saw you lead our cavalry sir 
 excuse me my lord norrisnewman of the standard my lord 
 an historical moment gentlemen 
 and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists N 
 tomorrow we will continue our advance on ulundi dumford kindly return to your unit bring them here immediately to support pulleine mr vereker will join you as adc do you understand me clearly 
 im explaining my reasons 
 are you dictating the strategy of this war sir 
 intelligence sources of your own did it not occur to you they may be native rumours rumours to draw you off to leave the whole ofnatal open to a possible counter thrust 
 i have received intelligence from sources of my own that the zulu impis are moving north of here and threaten your left 
 you intended to bring your reserves across the river 
 my lord this list was prepared for you i don t think another can understand its true value 
 excellent thank you give them to crealock would you 
 i thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks zulu 
 oh indeed crealock we should see that colonel dumford has an officer for his hard riders perhaps a subaltern from the twenty fourth 
 they come well recommended do they durnford 
 sikali horse my lord christians all i know each one by name 
 splendid horsemanship who are they 
 certainly sin 
 splendid site crealock splendil i want to establish camp here immediately 
 a large party of zulus have been sighted in the direction of the kings kraal getting up chelmsford moves over to look at the map on his desk 
 yes 
 thank you 
 the only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the royal kraal at ulundi 
 our runners bare his dispatches do they not 
 er called noggs sir actual name is norrisnewman he presented credentials from the standard 
 whats that strange name the newspaper chaps called 
 but will they make good use of them 
 yes i see you have issued each of them with a martini henry carbine our quota for native contingencies one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle 
 right bombardier to me please 
 well fed or hungry pulleine wants them in position immediately 
 well my horses are feeding as you may observe mr coghill it will take a little while 
 how quickly can you move your artillery forward 
 yes 
 stuart 
 keep steady you are the best shots of the twentyfourth you bunch of heathens do it 
 choose your targets men thats right watch those markers N 
 ft could be you flatter yourself coghill its that odd eye 
 well that one the one who keeps looking at me 
 which one 
 do you think she might be interested in someone 
 well thats typical of her majestys army appoint an engineer to do a soldiers work 
 um there are rumours that my lord chelmsford intends to make durnford second in command 
 lighting coghill N cigar our good colonel dumford scored quite a coup with the sikali horse 
 so far only their scouts but we have had reports of a small impi farther north over there 
 and i assure you you do not in fact id be obliged for your best advice what have your scouts seen 
 well i assure you sir i have no desire to create difficulties N 
 i think chelmsford wants a good man on the border why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady commander in reserve 
 lord chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my basutos 
 im to take the sikali with the main column to the river 
 your orders mr vereker 
 good ones yes mr vereker gentlemen who can ride and shoot 
 colonel durnford william vereker i hear you have been seeking officers
