 i think you are right it would be harder on her but youd better call mr hillyer shes going to need help to get home 
 that would scare her to death shes terrified of hospitals to her a hospital is where you go to die 
 yes and its very bad it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia 
 but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled 
 well she has one mouth in ten thousand i dont see teeth like that once in ten years her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth but there isnt a cavity in her head not a single one she has perfect teeth

 oh no maam

 hasnt he got enough problems or didnt you notice thats not cream soda on his breath 
 maybe im not making myself clear you are probably the first girl billyboys ever fallen in love with and i know for sure you are the first hes slept with so hows he gonna feel when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didnt have to pull out at the last second to get his closeup

 she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family there is no avoiding the battle you must face and destroy vader 
 but you cant let her get involved now ben vader will destroy her 
 your insight serves you well bury your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor 
 leia leias my sister 
 hmm to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous 
 but i have no sister 
 the other he spoke of is your twin sister 
 yoda spoke of another 
 then the emperor has already won you were our only hope 
 i cant kill my own father 
 to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side the side your father couldnt get past impatience is the easiest door for you like your father only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm you are no longer so reckless now luke you are strong and patient and now you must face darth vader again 
 but i had to help my friends 
 vader humbled you when first you met him luke but that experience was part of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda you would have been prepared 
 i tried to stop him once i couldnt do it 
 you cannot escape your destiny 
 i cant do it ben 
 i also thought he could be turned back to the good side it couldnt be done he is more machine now than man twisted and evil 
 theres still good in him 
 you father was seduced by the dark side of the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed so what i have told you was true from a certain point of view 
 you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father 
 yoda will always be with you 
 i cant do it artoo i cant go on alone 
 who are you 
 jabbas palace 
 where am i 
 your eyesight will return in time 
 i cant see 
 shhh you have hibernation sickness 
 his lightsaber 
 oh no my young jedi you will find that it is you who are mistakenabout a great many things 
 then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them 
 they are clear my master 
 strange that i have not i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear lord vader 
 i have felt him my master 
 a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor 
 i told you to remain on the command ship 
 yes my master 
 it is of no concern soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us your work here is finished my friend go out to the command ship and await my orders 
 what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust 
 send the fleet to the far side of endor there it will stay until called for 
 what is thy bidding my master 
 everything is proceeding as i have foreseen 
 as you wish 
 patience my friend in time he will seek you out and when he does you must bring him before me he has grown strong only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force 
 yes my master 
 you have done well lord vader and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker 
 the death star will be completed on schedule 
 threepio tell them if they dont do as you wish you will become angry and use your magic 
 somehow i got the feeling that didnt help us very much 
 han dont it will be all right 
 hey 
 yeah sure 
 will you take it easy lets just figure out a way to get out of this thing han can you reach my lightsaber 
 nice work great chewie great always thinking with your stomach 
 come on artoo we will need your scanners

 what did he say 
 its against my programming to impersonate a deity 
 proper 
 i beg your pardon general solo but that just wouldnt be proper 
 well why dont you use your divine influence and get us out of this 
 hello i think i could be mistaken they are using a very primitive dialect but i do believe they think i am some sort of god 
 what are you telling them 
 all right hang on 
 here we go again 
 on second thought lets pass on that huh 
 in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years 
 you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon the nesting place of the allpowerful sarlacc 
 good i hate long waits 
 oh dear his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately 
 i hope so commander for your sake the emperor is not as forgiving as i am 
 we shall double our efforts 
 that is correct commander and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress 
 then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives 
 but he asks the impossible i need more men 
 the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation 
 i tell you this station will be operational as planned 
 perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them 
 i assure you lord vader my men are working as fast as they can 
 you may dispense with the pleasantries commander im here to put you back on schedule 
 lord vader this is an unexpected pleasure we are honored by your presence 
 copy gold leader im already on my way out 
 all right wedge go for the power regulator on the north tower 
 there it is 
 form up and stay alert we could run out of space real fast 
 now lock onto the strongest power source it should be the power generator 
 here goes nothing 
 im going in 
 nowcome on han old buddy dont let me down 
 good shot red two 
 red leader standing by 
 all wings report in 
 oh no 
 im afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash 
 quiet

 whats he saying 
 your royal highness 
 oh 
 ohhh i cant bear to watch 
 ugh 
 becausethere is good in him i have felt it he wont turn me over to the emperor i can save him i can turn him back to the good side i have to try 
 but why must you confront him 
 no you dont you have always been strong 
 no luke run away far away if he can feel your presence then leave this place i wish i could go with you 
 then you know why i have to face him 
 i know somehowi have always known 
 yes its you leia 
 you are wrong leia you have that power too in time you will learn to use it as i have the force is strong in my family my father has iti have itandmy sister has it 
 luke dont talk that way you have a power ii dont understand and could never have 
 theres more it wont be easy for you to hear it but you must if i dont make it back you are the only hope for the alliance 
 your father 
 hes my father 
 vader is herenow on this moon 
 luke tell me whats troubling you 
 i have no memory of my mother i never knew her 
 she was very beautiful kind butsad why are you asking me all this

 leia do you remember your mother your real mother 
 i see them wait leia 
 over there two more of them 
 neverrr 
 sister soyou have a twin sister your feelings have now betrayed her too obiwan was wise to hide her from me now his failure is complete if you will not turn to the dark side then perhaps she will 
 give yourself to the dark side it is the only way you can save your friends yes your thoughts betray you your feelings for them are strong especially for 
 i will not fight you 
 you cannot hide forever luke 
 you underestimate the power of the dark side if you will not fight then you will meet your destiny 
 you couldnt bring yourself to kill me before and i dont believe you will destroy me now 
 there is no conflict 
 your thoughts betray you father i feel the good in youthe conflict 
 i will not fight you father 
 obiwan has taught you well 
 it is too late for me son the emperor will show you the true nature of the force he is your master now 
 search your feelings father you cant do this i feel the conflict within you let go of your hate 
 if that is your destiny 
 i will not turnand you will be forced to kill me 
 you dont know the power of the dark side i must obey my master 
 obiwan once thought as you do 
 come with me 
 so you have accepted the truth 
 i know father 
 the emperor has been expecting you 
 remember a jedis strength flows from the force but beware anger fear aggression the dark side are they once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny 
 well im sorry 
 unfortunate that i know the truth

 listen i gotta problem this girl aint feelin well yknow the doctor says she should exercise yknow once in awhile an ice skatin is the best thing 
 yo pal whats with you the place aint operatin 
 wait here gotta smooth this guy out 
 hey the rink is empty cause we are closed ya aint allowed in here so do me a favor an not stay here 
 are ya closed to the general public or to just everybody 
 hey whatta ya doin here we are closed yo we are closed 
 not only has he refused to fall but he has beaten the champions body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest 
 without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen the ringside audience is spotted with blood this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall 
 no way but the brilliant ability of the champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks rocky creed on the offensive balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart that hurt 
 theres no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power 
 apollo almost sprints out of his corner feints and throws a pair of leftright combinations balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on creeds temple not much movement from balboa duck a left a right another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple i mean explodes the champ backs off 
 round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if creed can put the challenger away there goes the bell 
 if you had asked anyone who knows boxing they never would have predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the champion most fighters will tell you receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying 
 creed is down 
 the champion is smiling and toying with the man trying to give the fans their moneys worth and make a show of it with the badly outclasses challenger another left to right combination i feel sorry for 
 the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face creed doesnt look the best hes ever been but is moving smoothly creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner oh a solid hook by creed a master of fistmen 
 i agree 
 its been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington a great way to start N off 
 am i seeing right creed is approaching the ring in a boat is he supposed to be george washington obviously so 
 you could go deaf with the noise it undoubtedly means champion apollo creed is heading towards the ring 
 i only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds vegas odds say no 
 thank you bob the electricity is everywhere tonight rocky balboa a fiftytoone underdog is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples imaginations all over the world to quote a popular sports magazine the fighting style should be the caveman against the cavalier from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring his record is fortyfour wins twenty losses and thirtyeight knockouts 
 we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight the first major event of the bicentennial year a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world i would like to welcome an old friend and cocommentator for this evenings event jimmy michaels

 my problem is i got a fiftyyearold lust and a threeyearold dinkie 
 oh a ladies man huh 
 yeah 
 you serve martinis doncha 
 we dont serve formula snookums 
 yeah does he wear pants this color 
 my hunch is it was maroon he always was after acmes property 
 somebody took it from him thats what this whole things about 
 so where is it then 
 and another thing the paper said no will was found but every toon knows acme had a will and in it he promised to leave toontown to the toons 
 cmon valiant doesnt this whole thing smell a bit funny to you i mean no offense but how did a muckymuck like rk maroon find you in the first place 
 my problem is i come here to drink in peace so if you dont mind 
 you dont believe that i mean the guys an idiot a moron a complete fool but hed never kill anyone i know the guy 
 you mean the rabbit they got him cold 
 yeah i had to go slummin see a friend of mines bein framed 
 i know who you are kinda out of your neighborhood arent you 
 make it dry baby doesnt like to be wet you are valiant right the names baby herman 
 sounds like you ve never seen her eddie 
 big on the musical comedy huh 
 he comes here every night to see jessica rabbit 
 shoulda guessed 
 thats marvin acme the gag king 
 yeah you still got it betty whos mr jocularity

 wish i could say the same what are you doin here betty 
 gee its swell to see you eddie we miss you in toontown 
 im not worried about you im worried about the safe 
 dont worry about me i can take it 
 i have already dropped it on you twentythree times 
 please raoul i can give you stars i know i can just drop the safe on my head one more time 
 thats right a tweeting bird but what does the script say rabbit gets conked rabbit sees stars not birds stars 
 a tweeting bird 
 whats this roger 
 familiar be careful eddie 
 that will work out just fine when this thing is over i will take you to catalina how does that sound 
 yeah they closed me down for a coupla weeks 
 what have i got to lose you okay dolores 
 are you gonna call him eddie 
 i will bet 
 i was hopin youd be there maroons called here about four times he says hes gotta talk to you tonight he says he can help you 
 oh no 
 sounds like singin 
 whats that comin from the bar 
 got me but unless the will shows up by friday midnight its theirs 
 what the hell would they want with a gag factory 
 nope its that cloverleaf outfit again 
 maroon right 
 i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate 
 probably lookin for a good place to stick a knife 
 the rabbits wife wanna tell me what she was doin with her arms around you 
 that was the rabbits wife 
 what was that 
 yeah do that im gonna go rattle maroons cage 
 eddie you still got it hey tomorrow maybe i will go down to probate court and see whos sniffin around acmes estate 
 then whyd they bother to crack the safe you can drop a mosler N from mount baldy and it wont open 
 maybe they just took it out of his pocket 
 maybe baby herman was right somebody wants acmes property cack the old man pin it on roger and destroy the will 
 so whats the scam eddie 
 if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this 
 can you get him out of it eddie 
 i oughta have my head examined will you hold still 
 so you decided to help him after all 
 its all yours 
 oh yeah well you are not handcuffed to him anybody in the back room 
 hes a riot 
 dolores meet roger rabbit 
 jesus eddie is this who i think it is 
 hes a toon who cares 
 so you are not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbits gettin framed 
 stick to stuffin the olives willya dolores 
 the papers said the safe door was opened eddie 
 thanks for the vote of confidence 
 yeah eddie its not like you got an ad in the yellow pages 
 i dont wanna think i wanna drink 
 do you think the rabbit did it 
 bastards put him on notice 
 no kiddin bought the red cars huh 
 a new outfit bought the red car some big company called cloverleaf industries 
 what are you complaining about heres your fifty bucks 
 hey eddie looks like you really stepped in it this time 
 rk maroon 
 check the scrawl 
 is this paper even good 
 you will have it in the morning now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket 
 this is fifty bucks i need seventyfive before they check the books tomorrow 
 would this be the same dame whos going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out i have got her money 
 so makin dame jokes huh eddie well lemme remind ya pal it was a dame who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord wouldt throw you out of your dump and it was a dame who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would and its a dame whos tired of waitin for you to straighten yourself out and get a job 
 thats right me 
 you 
 not really only a toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea 
 surprised 
 holy shit hes a toon 
 not for long we are retiring the red cars people will drive mr valiant because they will have to and when they drive they will have to buy our cars our tires our gasoline 
 thats what this is all about tell me whos gonna use your lousy freeway we got the red cars the best public transportation in the country 
 a freeway mr valiant is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from la to pasadena pasadena to hollywood hollywood to santa monica someday everyone will be in cars driving happily nonstop from one end of the la basin to another 
 what the hells a freeway 
 right here where we are standing will be the cornerstone of my idea the cloverleaf an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways 
 they wont care whos going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future 
 dont you think anyones gonna notice that toontowns gone 
 it wasnt toontown they wanted it was my idea of how to put the land to better use 
 come on doom what would a company like that want with toontown 
 no one person is cloverleaf we are a vast company with diverse interests gasoline tires automobiles 
 so you are cloverleaf 
 no matter i dont expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes by then cloverleaf will own toontown quite legally 
 i have had enough of your insolence put him in my car i think they will enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the acme factory 
 the pots callin the kettle maniacal 
 these roads can be very treacherous at night especially in a maniacal toon vehicle 
 yeah well dont expect the toons to give you a gold watch 
 well why not im feeling magnanimous tonight the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist im retiring to take a new role in the private sector 
 yes and for that you are charged with aiding and abetting but we will let santino handle that 
 i dont think its gonna matter sorry pal i tried 
 you are a very stubborn man mr valiant very pigheaded boys show mr valiant how we handle pigheaded men at the toontown station 
 i aint tellin you nothin get me santino 
 indeed we are we will continue the interrogation there 
 you are not takin me to downtown toontown 
 oh not that downtown toontown 
 downtown fine get a hold of santino id be more than glad to talk to him 
 take it easy bongo we will handle mr valiant our own way downtown 
 the other people who were in here lookin for the will i woulda caught em if cheetah here hadnt interrupted me 
 they 
 they must have taken it off me 
 he had a will all right she took it off acme the night she and rk maroon knocked him off then she set up her loving husband to take the fall 
 marvin acme had no will i should know the probate is in my court 
 ask her 
 being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective what were you looking for mr valiant 
 have you tried walla walla kokomos very nice this time of year 
 so you wouldnt have any idea where he might be 
 why would he contact me i just took some lousy pictures 
 yes i find that weasles have a special gift for the work the rabbit didnt contact you by any chance did he 
 men they look more like weasles to me 
 hey pal do i look like a stenographer 
 yes we talked to mr maroon he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back is that true 
 hes not my client i was workin for rk maroon 
 uh eddie do me a favor could you sit in the back so you wont cause as much of a commotion 
 not much its hard to talk 
 does it hurt 
 no 
 you are a pig a happygolucky pig 
 what am i earl 
 boy i will say they gave you a real toonaroo 
 toon cops worked me over 
 eddie jesus what happened 
 earl its me valiant 
 heres one for the books a toon wearin human clothes 
 eddie come on 
 hold on a second 
 he made me laugh 
 lemme guess where you got that from tell me somethin whatd you ever see in that guy anyway 
 looks like our goose is cooked our hash is slung our fait is accompli 
 a joker to the end 
 when i opened up the blue envelope all that was inside was a blank piece of paper 
 so where is it 
 marvin told me doom was after his land ne was afraid thats why he brought me his will 
 how did you get onto doom 
 hes right here in the 
 where is he 
 we are even by the way i did find your husband 
 i didnt know who i could trust 
 why didnt you tell me 
 it was doom who killed acme you know 
 dont worry you are not the first we better get out of here 
 lady i guess i had you pegged wrong 
 thats not roger its one of dooms men he killed rk maroon 
 you shot roger 
 if im as bad as you think whats stopping me from just killing you right now 
 cause i dont take acme dumb pills i dont know what you are up to lady but im gonna nail you for the acme murder 
 its the truth why wont you believe it 
 so altruistic 
 im not complainin but give me credit im the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin pattycake remember 
 im not bad im just drawn that way 
 yeah well you dont know how hard it is bein a man looking at a woman looking the way you do 
 oh please dont make fun of me mr valiant you dont know how hard it is being a woman looking the way i do 
 oh sure i can just feature you standin outside your little hutch holdin a carrot cake waitin for hubby to come home 
 no no no i love my husband 
 yeah i will bet you would you gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work 
 you have got the wrong idea about me ia a pawn in this just like poor roger can you help me find him i will pay you anything 
 no i guess we are not counting lying stealing and murder 
 toons arent given imperfections 
 come on lady havent you ever seen a mole before 
 okay you have seen me now give me a towel 
 oh well i i just had to see you 
 thats because i dont have a doorbell

 well everybody needs a hobby

 you are not too good at this are you rk 
 that was the idea 
 valiant you surprised me

 maybe why 
 have you got the will 
 maroon whaddaya want

 the jobs gonna cost you a hundred bucks 
 you dont have to the rabbits wife sings at an underground toon revue joint called the ink and paint club you can catch her in action there 
 i dont work in toontown 
 get me a couple juicy pictures somethin i can wise the rabbit up with 
 so what do you want me to do 
 heres the problem seen cooing over calamari with notsonew sugar daddy was jessica rabbit wife of maroon star roger his wifes a tramp but he thinks shes betty crocker the doubts eatin him up 
 nah that goes with the territory hes a stunt bunny 
 one too many safes dropped on his head 
 yeah and theres no business as expensive im twentyfive grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and its all because that rabbit cant keep his mind on his work and you know why 
 only theres no business like it no business i know

 i think you oughta read it to her 
 yeah

 thats because its disappearingreappearing ink shows up three days later gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesnt punch you in the nose great gag 
 thats not blood thats ink that goof acme squirted me with some the other day why its comin through now i dont know 
 not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage 
 real good rog but maybe you better let me take over

 what the hell are you doin in there 
 id head for cucamonga 
 yeah 
 if i dont make it back here by ten 
 i rest my case 
 two bits 
 how much is a shave and a haircut roger

 i tell you what maybe i better come with you 
 thats why i will be there at N 
 gee eddie you are not gonna go are ya maroon will be layin for ya at nine oclock 
 no its not 
 wrong number 
 get away from there 
 i will get it 
 piano guy got away disappeared into toontown nobody ever saw him again 
 safe 
 yeah everybody thought so but me and teddy got a kick out of toons all toons we couldnt see the bad in em and when this guy was accused of knockin over the first national bank of toontown we took his case but when we looked into it we found out he did do it after all we went to his house to take him in but he was wise he got the drop on us literally 
 him oh he was vile heinous despicable a smear on the drafting board 
 yeah a toon it was the guy who killed bambis mother 
 a toon noooo 
 you wanna know well since you are so goddamn curious i will tell ya one of you toons killed my brother 
 gee you shamuses are a tough audience but what happened to you that was so dark lurid embittering 
 you damn toon no wonder they picked you for the patsy always gotta play the fool you make me sick 
 what is this twenty questions 
 gee i didnt recognize you i have never seen you laugh before that your brother makin the rabbit ears 
 me 
 say whos this guy laughin 
 we cant do anything till its dark 
 so whats our plan our scenario our modus operandi 
 my brother get inside 
 valiant and valiant whos the other valiant 
 if im so smart how come im runnin from the law with a toon 
 oh eddie that was quick thinkin nothin like usin the old noggin the noodle the grey matter 
 drink it jerk all of it 
 but eddie you know what happens when 
 here you go kid say hi to casper for me 
 i think you want a drink how about it judge 
 a blindfold cigarette noseplugs just kidding 
 hey doesnt the rabbit even get a last request 
 well right now its gonna be your funereal 
 i have met some cynical and miserable humans in my time but you edward valiant are positively funereal 
 i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety 
 a laugh can be a powerful thing eddie sometimes its the only weapon we have in life 
 just because you got em to laugh 
 well i still dont think hed turn me in 
 an arsonist and a kidnapper he just got outta prison 
 angelo hes a pal a chum 
 and when they are done laughin they are gonna call the cops that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel 
 but thats my calling my purpose my raison detre toons are supposed to make people laugh and believe me those people needed a laugh 
 why you crazy toon i have been out there riskin my neck for you i come back here and you are singin and dancin 
 hey dont i get an encore 
 because hes not forty feet tall the safe was up on the ceiling remember 
 well mr smartypants detective your logic is specious what prevented mr acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him 
 well acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club it was gone in the morning when the cops found the body 
 how do you know that 
 yeah except they screwed up i dont think they got the will 
 the habeus corpus is thickening 
 your wife may be a lot of things pal but innocent isnt one of them 
 i resent that innuendo my wife is completely innocent 
 yeah i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind your wife the sound body 
 yeah well you just might get your wish 
 my philosophy is if you dont have a sense of humor you are better off dead 
 are you always this funny or only on days when you are wanted for murder 
 well no not any time only when it was funny 
 you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time 
 yeah thats better 
 does this help 
 dont ever forget that 
 sorry eddie i forgot you are not a toon 
 hey what do you think you are doin 
 you idiot i lost the key for those cuffs 
 eddie valiant you are under arrest just kidding 
 gee eddie im a rabbit we always run 
 if you are so innocent whyd you run 
 dont do that im innocent i tell ya the police will just dip me they were waitin for me when i got home last night i ran 
 look pal if you are still here when i finish this drink im callin the police 
 in other words the whole goddamn world knows you are here out get out 
 well i asked the newsboy on the corner he didnt know then i asked a janitor the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way he was very helpful 
 oh yeah then howd you find my house 
 dont worry eddie no one knows im here 
 so i hear even talkin to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting 
 i needed a place to hide im in trouble eddie

 why what is tybalt 
 but alas poor romeo he is already dead stabbed with a white wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bowboys buttshaft and is he a man to encounter tybalt 
 nay he will answer the letters master how he dares being dared 
 any man that can write may answer a letter 
 romeo will answer it 
 a challenge on my life 
 tybalt the kinsman of old capulet hath sent a letter to his fathers house 
 why that pale hardhearted wench that rosaline torments him so that he will sure run mad 
 not to his fathers i spoke with his man 
 where the devil should this romeo be came he not home tonight 
 romeo humours madman passion lover i conjure thee by rosalines bright eyes by her high forehead and her scarlet lip by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh o romeo that she were an open ass and thou a poperin pear romeo good night i will to my trucklebed this fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep 
 romeo romeo 
 art thou hurt 
 forbear this outrage good mercutio 
 i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this nights revels and expire the term of a despised life closed within my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail on lusty gentlemen 
 this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late 
 but tis no wit to go 
 every man betake him to his legs 
 not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food whippd and tormented good day good fellow 
 by giving liberty unto thine eyes examine other beauties why romeo art thou mad 
 teach me how i should forget to think 
 be ruled by me forget to think of her 
 she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste 
 then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste 
 well in that hit you miss she will not be hit with cupids arrow nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes nor open her lap to saintseducing gold 
 a right fair mark fair cuz is soonest hit 
 a right good marksman and shes fair i love 
 i aimd so near when i supposed you loved 
 in sadness cousin i do love a woman 
 tell me in sadness who is that you love 
 soft i will go along an if you leave me so you do me wrong 
 farewell my cuz 
 at thy good hearts oppression 
 good heart at what 
 no cuz i rather weep 
 alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will where shall we dine o me what fray was here yet tell me not for i have heard it all heres much to do with hate but more with love why then o brawling love o loving hate o any thing of nothing first create o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms feather of lead dost thou not laugh 
 alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof 
 out of her favour where i am in love 
 of love 
 out 
 in love 
 not having that which having makes them short 
 it was what sadness lengthens romeos hours 
 ay me sad hours seem long was that my father that went hence so fast 
 but new struck cuz 
 is the day so young 
 goodmorrow cousin 
 why then o brawling love o loving hate o anything of nothing first create heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of well seeming forms 
 go to what goodman boy i say he shall go to make a mutiny among my guests 
 uncle tis a shame 
 he shall be endured 
 i will not endure him 
 content thee gentle cuz content thee let him alone i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement therefore be patient take no note of him 
 tis he 
 young romeo is it 
 uncle this is that villain romeo a montague our foe 
 why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so 
 what dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity now by the stock and honour of my kin to strike him dead i hold it not a sin 
 here is my gold worse poison to mens souls than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell 
 drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight 
 i pay thy poverty and not thy will 
 my poverty but not my will consents 
 the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law then be not poor but break it and take this 
 such mortal drugs i have but veronas law is death to any that utters them 
 what if this mixture do not work at all shall i be married then tomorrow morning 
 i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent if rather than to marry paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie in the meantime against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilling liquor drink thou off i will send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua 
 be not so long to speak i long to die 
 hold daughter 
 if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this i will help it presently 
 it strains me past the compass of my wits 
 my leisure serves me pensive daughter now we must entreat the time alone 
 are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass 
 and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but loves shadows are so rich in joy news from verona how now balthasar dost thou not bring me letters from the priest how doth my lady is my father well how doth my lady juliet for nothing can be ill if she be well 
 as the custom is in all her best array bear her to church 
 farewell 
 hie you make haste but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy than thou wentst forth in lamentation quick hence be gone by break of day sojourn in mantua 
 how well my comfort is revived by this 
 o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness this is dear mercy and thou sees it not hence 
 there is no world without verona walls hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death then banished is death mistermed calling death banished thou cust my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me 
 affliction is enamoured of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity hence from verona art thou banished be patient for the world is broad and wide 
 banishment be merciful say death for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death do not say banishment 
 wisely and slow they stumble that run fast 
 o let us hence i stand on sudden haste 
 o she new well thy love read by rote and could not spell come young waverer come go with me in one respect i will thy assistant be for this alliance may so happy prove to turn you household rachor to pure love 
 i pray thee chde me not whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow the other did not so 
 for doting not for loving pupil mine 
 thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline 
 holy saint francis what a change is here is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes 
 then plainly know my hearts dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet we met we wooed we made exchange of vow i will tell thee as we pass but this i pray that thou consent to marry us today 
 be plain good son and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift 
 i have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me thats by me wounded both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies 
 thats my good son but where hast thou been 
 rosaline my ghostly father no i have forgot that name and that names woe 
 god pardon sin was thou with rosaline 
 the last is true the sweeter rest was mine 
 young son it argues a distemperd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed or if not so so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not seen his bed tonight 
 benedicite what early tounge so sweet saludeth me 
 good marrow father 
 sir a ring my lady bid me give you 
 i thought thy disposition better tempered thy juliet is alive there art thou happy the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile there art thou happy a pack of blessings light upon thy back wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once 
 romeo come forth 
 where is my ladys lord 
 welcome 
 i come for my lady juliet 
 o mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but straind from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice being misaplied and vice sometimes by action dignified within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant 
 juliet 
 romeo i drink to thee

 o god i have an illdivining soul methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb o fortune fortune be fickle fortune for then i hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back 
 i doubt it not trust me love all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come adieu

 let me be taken let me be put to death i have more care to stay then will to go come death welcome juliet wills it so how ist my soul let us talk it is not day 
 that light is not daylight i know it i it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua therefore stay yet thou needest not be gone 
 i must be gone and live or stay and die 
 wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day 
 mercutios soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company 
 come gentle night come loving blackbrowned night give me my romeo and when i shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun o i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though i am sold not yet enjoyed o tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them 
 i will not fail tis twenty year till then 
 by the hour of nine 
 romeo at what oclock tomorrow shall i send to thee 
 a thousand times the worse to want thy light love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks 
 a thousand times good night exit above 
 so thrive my soul 
 i gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
 the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine 
 what satisfaction canst thou have tonight 
 o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied 
 do not swear although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens sweet good night this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet good night 
 if my hearts dear love 
 do not swear at all or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and i will believe thee 
 well what shall i swear by 
 o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable 
 lady by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruittree tops 
 thou knowst the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke but farewell compliment dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst thou mayst prove false o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully 
 i have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love 
 if they do see thee they will murder thee 
 with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me 
 how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore the garden walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here 
 neither fair maid if either thee dislike 
 art thou not romeo and a montague 
 ahhh 
 i take thee at thy word 
 tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague whats montague it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man o be some other name whats in a name that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet so romeo would were he not romeo calld retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title o romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself 
 shall i hear more or shall i speak at this 
 romeo o romeo wherefore art thou romeo deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and i will no longer be a capulet 
 she speaks o speak again bright angel 
 ay me 
 he jests at scars that never felt a wound but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it oh cast it off it is my lady o it is my love o that she knew she were 
 you kiss by the book 
 sin from my lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again 
 then have my lips the sin that they have took 
 then move not while my prayers effect i take thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged 
 saints do not move though grant for prayers sake 
 well then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair 
 ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer 
 have not saints lips and holy palmers too 
 good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss 
 if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle sin is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss 
 did my heart love till now forswear it sight for i neer saw true beauty till this night 
 go girl seek happy nights to happy days 
 go we follow thee juliet blah

 good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you 
 signior romeo bon jour theres a french salutation to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night 
 ho ho capital punks 
 ay so i fear the more is my unrest 
 away begone the sport is at the best 
 true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angerd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dew dropping south 
 peace good mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing 
 o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agatestone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies over mens noses as they lie asleep her chariot is an empty hazelnut her wagoner a small greycoated gnat and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is shethis is she 
 in bed asleep while they do dream things true 
 that dreamers often lie 
 well what was yours 
 and so did i 
 i dreamd a dream tonight 
 why may one ask 
 if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down 
 is love a tender thing it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn 
 too great oppression for a tender thing 
 under loves heavy burden do i sink 
 you are a lover borrow cupids wings and soar with them above a common bound 
 not i not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead 
 young hearts run free never be caught up caught up like rosaline and thee nay gentle romeo we must have you dance 
 i am for you 
 good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives 
 what wouldst thou have with me 
 calm dishonorable vile submission thou art my souls hate tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk 
 consort what does thou make us minstrels an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords heres my fiddlestick heres that shall make you dance zounds consort 
 mercutio thou art consortest with romeo

 you shall find me apt enough to that sir and you will give me occasion 
 oh and but one word with one of us couple it with something make it a word and aa blow 
 follow me close gentlemen gooday a word with one of you 
 as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that names cursed hand did murder her kinsman 
 o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and then on romeo cries and then falls down again 
 sir ah sir death the end of all 
 nurse 
 bid her to come to confession this afternoon and there she shall at father laurence cell be shrived and married 
 if ye should lead her into a fools paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behavior as they say for the lady is young and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing 
 his name is romeo and hes a montague the only son of your great enemy 
 is she a capulet 
 madam your mother craves a word with you come lets away 
 as my american friend larry would say are you fucking deaf its under your seat 
 what 
 its under your seat 
 to make a point i dont know her and i was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk i dont particularly like you so imagine what i will do if you try anything 
 why did you do that 
 you know it is 
 do you really think so 
 this is important 
 always in a rush you are all these years i have known you you could never wait for anything 
 do you have it 
 im up for that 
 i dont know i was thinkingmaybe the three of us might partner up guns for hire that sort of thing 
 so where do you go from here 
 only the stupid ones cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets besides im not ira no more 
 i dont want you dead woman i want the the truth 
 you go shoot me if you want vincent but you will be dead before i hit the ground 
 and i dont believe you 
 well i dont 
 when this whole thing started you made it clear you are running the show and i dont believe youd be running this show if you didnt know what was going on 
 i dont know 
 finding this package is a thing easier said than done we dont even know what it is what did we steal 
 of course 
 very good now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid 
 and then sam you and i clean up whatevers left to be cleaned 
 leaving 
 while sam and i take out the back two cars 
 is that right 
 we kept it 
 of course 
 coordinate all you want but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me are we in sync on this vincent 
 i drink what every civilized man woman and child in the world drinks guinness 
 oh yeah whatta you drink then 
 budweiser you talk to me of beer and you have the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence thats not beer christ its not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss 
 best beer in the world budweiser for me thanks 
 best beer in the world known to man or god 
 what is 
 some places not all italy for instance they are serious about their food but try bloody britain anywhere in the uk you dont get much fancier than a deepfried bar egg foods not our thing you see 
 thisthis is incredible is the rest of europe like this 
 thats why you were riding with him 
 i never did trust that blonde fuck 
 how do we know that 
 and you believed me but it wasnt my people who did it 
 and then 
 then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous 
 which leads us to 
 you call me with the targets route i follow along until we have reached the attack point and then i run his squag ass off the road 
 the deal the deal is we leave for nice at first light 
 so whats the deal 
 and who are you 
 i drive and my name is larry larry from the states 
 the name is deirdre and im running this show 
 who the fuck are you 
 its good to see you have all got such faith in our little undertaking 
 no seamus i heard you the first time 
 do i need to repeat myself 
 shut up shut up and drive im your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say is that understood 
 you are thinking with your gun seamus and not your head 
 plastic fucking surgeon you think im going to fix this deirdre lass its the mark of the patriot and i will wear it like a badge as for those who done it to me i will take my pound of flesh before this is all over 
 you better be careful seamus before something happens a plastic surgeon cant fix 
 they are good 
 good christ cant you lose these jokers 
 not yet 
 about time 
 you lose them 
 lose them 
 thats him 
 from interpol 
 they are part of the team one of thems the guy i told you about 
 what in bloody hell is going on 
 nothing 
 would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there 
 problem my ass i think you are lying to me and if you are you are a dead man 
 i thought i did 
 not to me you know that 
 its been known to happen 
 so you thought that maybe id grown too attached to this charade i have been playing is that it 
 it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you you have been living the life of the hired gun the well paid hired gun i might note theres no glory to it but there are those that like it 
 and whats that supposed to mean seamus reilly 
 now theres the deirdre i know 
 when we are done with this i want to do for that one myself 
 come off it sam if we werent friends already we wouldnt be here now would we 
 not me you work too often with the same people and you become friends clouds your judgement 
 alright its bloody fucking freezing in here 
 are you alright 
 bloody fucking hell 
 i didnt say i was 
 where do you get off saying word one all the time pretending to be one of us its the same thing we were doing seamus and myself and here you are so high and mighty like you are so different from the rest of us 
 dont even think that im buying that 
 im a patriate 
 oh pleaseyou are on some sort of holy mission 
 well if it isnt mr interpol himself i cant believe i misjudged you like i did 
 that we are too stupid to trace his calls 
 check this out gregors a spook or he was one until recently when he was a spy he lived the life you know a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything then the wall goes down no more cold war and gregor is out of a job no apartment no special stores with western food and video tapes i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he doesnt want to give it up and i wouldnt be surprised if hes arrogant enough to think 
 i bought it for him all the stuff he was using it was in his contract cost a nice penny too especially that goddamned phone gregor had expensive tastes 
 exactly gregor he was the russians man it was my people came up with the idea for this run but the russians who had the capital to finance it gregor he was their insurance and i was ours everybody else was supposed to be neutral gregor must have got to swede 
 because if they had shed be gone along with the package instead of sitting here with us 
 i dont know well i dont its a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you but i do know who we are working for my people and the russian mob 
 now what did we steal 
 just business 
 duty calls 
 i better be getting that 
 exactly and last night i wanted to be with someone who was just like me 
 you are a hired gun deirdre just like me 
 i know i dont have to sam its just that for once i want to when i was a patriot it was a given id sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with you know any man who needed setting up sometimes so we might blackmail him sometimes so he could be killed sometimes so i could kill him myself ira isnt exactly an enlightened feminist organization sam to most of the men i with i was always the girl send the girl to do it tell the girl to take care of it have the girl fuck him but i look at you and i get this feeling you take me for what i am no more no less 
 you dont have to explain yourself to me deirdre 
 look sam dont take it the wrong way when i tell you we wont be doing this again 
 i probably do but for the time being im willing to forget about it 
 and when i consider that i have to wonder if you dont have some ulterior motive for being here with me right now 
 nobodys saying they dont 
 part of me says i should just look at this as a perk you know a bonus but then i remember you are you deirdre who used to belong to the ira and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you 
 thats right 
 is that right 
 i still am 
 i didnt think to see you again tonight you were pretty pissed 
 i feel as if i have wandered onto the set of enter the dragon could you teach me to do that 
 we werent real thrilled about it either 
 the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information and instead you went to fucking war 
 hazard pay 
 once 
 you were a soldier were you 
 sam im a weapons guy 
 he will kill me anway sam shoot though me and kill this fucker 
 shut up 
 dont do it sam 
 go ahead shoot shoot and kill the bitch i dont care and yet you dont shoot interesting put down your weapon and walk away 
 should any of you decide to rush me i will kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time 
 that fucking figures 
 theres a problem 
 wheres the case 
 ready when you are 
 alright gregor im 
 next 
 i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice relaying that information to you 
 now then lets run through it one more time shall we whats your job 
 in this business your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same 
 but would you stake your life thats the question 
 id stake my reputation 
 you sure about this 
 i intend to this phone is wired like no other its got an encryption chip and instant satalink recognition it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the targets cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes 
 good because it cost enough theres cheaper phones by far than that one man you better fucking use it 
 its quite satifactory 
 these days they they call me gregor and im a tech i do electronic work surveillance computer runs 
 from here on in you want something you pay cash for it no credit cards no bank accounts are in place ten percent up front the rest when the job is done you what do you do and what should we call you 
 not likely once yeah i was but there wasnt an inch of profit in it and im a cash oriented girl if you take my meaning im a hired gun same as the rest of you and thats all any of us needs to know about the other 
 who are you ira 
 i think not after you 
 perhaps we could both go at the same time 
 you first edvard 
 do you have the material 
 really do you have the money with you 
 we will double your price 
 im sure but im sorry to say that its too late for trust we have a serious problem 
 that was a mistake trying to kill you mikhi did it without consulting me id have never allowed it 
 im touched really that theyd send someone of your caliber its nice to know that they didnt make the mistake of underestimating me twice 
 yes gregor they sent me 
 then you better find it in your heart to tell me francois because while your death is inevitable it still isnt decided how painful its going to be 
 in here 
 wheres my information 
 of course 
 i take it you still want the money 
 if you say a word in english vincent my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat sorry to screw you over like this but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you and thats a price im not willing to pay 
 whats that 
 theres been a slight problem 
 heres yours 
 hes a cop vincent hes french and hes a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now 
 what do you mean 
 bad company 
 hes company 
 not so fast whos that 
 do you have it 
 you will die if you leave here 
 we will die if we stay here 
 i will destroy whatevers in the case 
 and more importantly 
 enough 
 im shocked shocked to think that youd believe him 
 edvard said the same thing about you before he died 
 whatever you wish this has all been a terrible mistake gregor i wanted to play straight with you but edvard insisted we try and kill you 
 no mikhi i wouldnt since i wont speak your language and you cant speak mine english will do nicely 
 sit sit would you like one 
 i think not i have of course taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens unless of course i deactivate it before it goes off 
 figured enough to know theres an odd man out and im looking at him 
 so you have got it all figured do you 
 whats a little hate between business partners 
 but you hate each other 
 what am i doing here why im here to see my partners gregor the boys in the russian mafia see your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross but they only just found out that whats in the briefcase is completely useless without me i cant fight them and they cant kill me that means we are gonna have to do business together 
 you have told me a lot of things boyo 
 it is im telling you it is 
 this better be the real thing or you are a dead man 
 i swear it has to come here it has to 
 if you are lying to me you poor excuse for a human being im gonna blow your brains all over this car 
 a post office box 
 sent it where 
 i sent it to myself in paris 
 then where is it 
 i swear 
 bullshit 
 i dont have it with me 
 dont talk to me unless you tell me what i want to hear understand you have no choice in this dont think about winning think about staying alive i want the item and if you dont give it to me im gonna kill you 
 now that is an interesting proposition 
 so none of us knows whos paying the freight this is just some anonymous job for all we know we are working for different people 
 i got this gig through a contractor and he most definitely didnt know who was doing the hiring only that they were paying a lot of money 
 whoever hired us 
 what i do is none of your concern what you should do is wait for my next phone call im going to find a place where i can tilt the field in my favor when im ready i will call you and tell you what i want you to do 
 so what do we do 
 im in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money the least you could do is have the decency to pay me 
 it was a mistake it shouldnt have happened 
 much to your disappointment no doubt 
 gregor is that you 
 its done 
 is it done 
 i do i do 
 i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with 
 i need you swede i cant do this without you 
 really 
 nobodys going to do that 
 dont cross me 
 what are you doing 
 whats that 
 there is one other thing 
 then i guess we are set 
 thats it 
 a means to an end is that it 
 i hadnt thought about it understand me gregor i take no pleasure in killing it doesnt bother me one bit but i dont get off on it 
 i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american 
 because if theres more than one party involved if we really are working for different people then perhaps some of us are on different sides your orders might be different from mine 
 how so 
 if he hadnt youd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago 
 how did you know 
 not exactly but close enough eh so he saved your life then 
 not exactly 
 i have never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through hes a cop 
 of course dont you 
 and you respect him 
 yes sams tough alright 
 hes tough your american friend 
 hello my friend he doesnt look french to me vincent 
 hello jeanpierre 
 a samurai has honor a samurai live by the code of bushido the way of the warrior im just a killer for hire the world isnt about honor anymore its about survival 
 you seem one to me 
 vincents life is his own burden he will have to carry it for himself and im not any kind of samurai 
 perhaps forged is a better word like steel like a sword you are a modern samurai i have spent my life around extraordinary men men like vincent but i have never seen anyone like you im afraid vincent will die if he goes with you 
 created 
 i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created 
 so what is it you want to know 
 perhaps but you are not healthy and if you try i will kill you 
 if i was healthy i could take that away from you 
 call it a reckoning of character 
 so this is what a test 
 not a word but no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do and so i place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me you work for some government agency and you carry a gun and in my world that makes you a cop 
 vincent told you that im a cop 
 you suffered through an agonizing pain last night pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law 
 i didnt expect that he would 
 he sees this differently as you well know 
 forgive my intrusion into your affairs but i am the one who connected vincent to this job his agent if you will he is one of my oldest friends and i owe him a great debt much like the debt i suspect he owes you 
 it gets done now or not at all another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where i cant get them 
 something important a thing that cannot wait 
 yeah 
 but first you have something to take care of 
 soon 
 you should really let a doctor look at that 
 some thanks enough to move on for now 
 then if you dont mind im gonna pass out 
 dont worry we will take care of it 
 you think you can stitch me up on you own 
 no boozepains in the mind and the mind i can control alright lets do it 
 are you sure you wont have a drink 
 well vincents american friend shall we see what we can do for you 
 american 
 did he bring that with him 
 what are you gonna do call him up and ask him to give us back our shit 
 fine with fucking me we got work to do i dont care what it takes we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do i dont know about the rest of you guys but im not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass i dont mean that in like a literal way 
 its a cocktail mostly demerol cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future 
 my way is better 
 yeah well my way works too 
 why dont you go do better then 
 its been known to happen 
 is that right 
 long enough to shoot back 
 not for long 
 all in the stomach though your man might live 
 gets the job done 
 you shoot alright 
 anybody tries to unpleasant me i will put two between his eyes one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes 
 the point remains we could be working for different people theres a chance for one of us maybe more than one of us has been paid to cross the others i dont know about you guys but i like to know who im working for it can help prevent a great deal of unpleasantness 
 i dont think so 
 i dont particularly like killing tubby but i want you to know that this one im going to enjoy 
 not in mine 
 its consider a virtue in some corners of the world 
 is that right 
 you should learn a little patience 
 where is this broad 
 i blast the lead car into oblivion 
 after we stop the target car i get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard 
 eat shit and die slowly 
 i ride with fatboy 
 who you calling dumb dickless 
 and you could stand to get a little smarter aint that right you dumb blonde fuck 
 im just worried about your health larry you could stand to shed a few pounds 
 who the fuck died and appointed you food czar 
 you should watch what you eat 
 everybody 
 whos they 
 they call me swede 
 i got a surprise for you blondie 
 what a surprise 
 what are you talking about man i dont understand 
 just to keep me company sam i hate smoking alone how about you i thought all you ira types smoked 
 i told you i quit 
 i guess thats for the best 
 gone destroyed 
 what happened to it 
 i dont know nobody knows except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us theres probably a couple of guys back at the company who know but i dont think they plan to tell me anytime soon 
 tell me something first the package what was it 
 you better get some sleep alright 
 i know 
 you dont owe me a goddamned thing vincent and you know it you stepped in front of a bullet for me i owe you a heavy debt 
 your field dressing saved his life thats three i owe you 
 nothing 
 what of it 
 you speak french 
 what 
 you sonofabitch 
 finish it 
 and now 
 finish the job 
 lets get him out of here 
 i will work on it 
 you have to stop doing that 
 no i dont 
 do you have a good answer 
 thats a good question 
 and when you finish what then this package whatever it is do you give it to the cia do you really think they deserve it 
 and yet you would have killed him to save my life you have a sense of honor vincent that i cant even remember anymore i dont know that i ever even had it to begin with all i know to do vincent is to finish my job 
 closest and oldest 
 its the one thing i have got left to hold onto jeanpierre is one of your closest friends is he not 
 why not 
 because i dont walk away 
 why then sam dont you act like this is a job like any other surely if you are a hired gun you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for 
 the mark of a true samurai what i do for the company vincent is no different than what you do we are both hired guns and this is a job like any other job 
 why you have got more force of will than anyone i have ever seen you handle a gun like its a part of you you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia and most amazing of all you quit smoking just like that 
 would you stop with that 
 what of it samurai pain in the ass 
 not just like that just before i turn around and its six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette 
 just like that 
 time to quit 
 if im going to die for the cia im going to go out smoking besides theres half a forest between us and them they cant see a goddamned thing 
 not here they might see it 
 yeah we need out fucking heads examined 
 do we need anything else 
 i think not 
 in a minute 
 if our positions were reversed would you leave me 
 no you dont and you know it 
 so i do it 
 i know i dont need to say this to you but i need to say it to you this is my job i have to do it 
 something like that 
 business keeps you on the road 
 im not here very much 
 why are you driving you are not french you dont live here you dont know these roads why are you driving 
 gimme a goddamn cigarette 
 right now 
 give me a cigarette 
 you dont know bullshit you had her there was no way out 
 i dont know 
 what the fuck happened 
 you said it yourself gregors not dead if they had the package theyd have killed him 
 you think 
 they dont have the package 
 because i owe you look at that 
 how could you have done that 
 i would have tried not to but yes if it would have kept him from shooting you i would have 
 you would have done that 
 i was waiting to see what would happen i didnt want to kill him if i didnt have to 
 you were behind the door 
 i know jeanpierre did 
 i never made that claim 
 not very zen of you huh not so much the modern samurai after all 
 it is at that 
 very ugly 
 dark operations wet work kidnaping assassination 
 dark ops 
 im a field agent last of an already extinct breed i do dark ops 
 its a cover then a cover within a cover a feint within a feint you work for the cia its the only possible answer 
 sure i do you heard him you heard the guy thats what he said what edvard said 
 then quit you dont work for interpol sam 
 its my job 
 continue when it would be so much easier to give it up 
 do what 
 tell me sam why do you do this 
 if tony says this is it then its it 
 you sure your friend got the right place 
 thorough man 
 the address of the russian production company just in case we need to find them 
 whats this 
 yes 
 the irish representative 
 i know of him 
 you know him 
 good now take the forceps and remember vincent what we are doing here is routine i have done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field there are no vital organs where you are working no major muscles or arteries you cant kill me just make sure you have got the bullet before you try to pull it out 
 clearly 
 you see the bullet 
 alright its done 
 yes i do 
 you dont have to do this 
 it isnt about money for me not anymore 
 this doesnt involve you dont you understand i cant even guarantee you any money out of all this 
 im going with you 
 we there is no we in my world now vincent just me 
 it looks to me like we are all thats left of our group 
 my job vincent a job you dont need to know about i cant go to the local cops theyd never be able to get close enough at this point its me or nobody and i have been on this job too goddamned long not to finish 
 and what job is that 
 if i was a cop a real cop id have busted you a long time ago this isnt about you its about the job i have to do 
 you are with interpol you are a cop 
 not exactly 
 fix it yourself why are we even doing this theres no need to run christ you are a cop 
 no hospitals i will fix this myself if i have to 
 noi thought id take you to the hospital 
 you know one around here somebody you trust 
 you see it your way i will see it mine you need a doctor 
 i didnt save your life back there risked it maybe but i didnt save shit 
 that makes twice now you have saved my life 
 but you cant 
 you are a copyou are a fucking copi should kill you 
 its paris the routes too indirect for anything else a guy like gregor he doesnt waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place otherwise hed be out of the country by now hes going to paris now i just hope we can find him before he gets there 
 not necessarily he could go off road at any number of places he might not even be in the country anymore 
 hes going back 
 you might be a hired gun vincent but i got a feeling you cost more than two bits 
 i never really thought i was part of the world you move in sam to tell you the truth im a hood a thief big time in a small time king of way to the local police im a prize to the local hoods im a legend but to a guy like you im just another two bit hired gun 
 we live in a singular world my friend 
 i wont lie there have been times when i had to do it times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didnt 
 you dont you just learn to live with it 
 i havent not like that how do you get used to it 
 i have seen a lot of people die before 
 a lot of people died 
 it was at that 
 i have a feeling im about to start buying my own 
 of coursewhenever you feel like it just help yourself 
 i borrowed that too 
 please help yourself smoke as many youd like 
 i hope you dont mind i took your pack it was on the table 
 you were smoking 
 i came up here to sneak a smoke 
 you werent around when i woke up i thought maybe something had happened this has been one very fucked up job sam and im not taking any more chances on anybody including you 
 whats going on 
 gregors cell phone 
 the question still remains what do we do now 
 because thats what i would have done 
 but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did 
 i saw you look off when francois nodded his head i figured he wasnt pointing out a particularly rare shrub and the rest was easy 
 that there was a gun pointed at me 
 know what 
 how did you know 
 well i aint a cop 
 i needed to see if you were a cop im a popular man with the police sam and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together and thats the guy you have to watch out for i hate cops 
 you know what you pulled back there that was bullshit 
 you need to know a lot of shit vincent 
 i needed to know 
 see what 
 i just wanted to see something 
 whats going on 
 theyd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york and it would still get fucked up 
 lovely isnt it 
 whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless 
 they certainly are whatever it is we are going to steal it must be quite something 
 thats right theres not hardly enough work these days nothing that pays the big money anyhow then along comes this job paying so much goddamned money i couldnt afford not to take it somebodys paying through the nose for this 
 you were once some kind of special forces airborne ranger maybe a navy seal after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan a real mercenary only now now you are like the rest of us its a very competitive market since the end of the cold war theres a lot of hired guns out here and not nearly enough work to go around 
 who am i 
 i wanted to see who you were 
 i have wondered that myself none of this answers my question though why bring me 
 i wonder if she truly left the ira 
 deirdre smart yeah and seriously goddamned dangerous 
 so is the woman 
 watch that one hes an exspook for sure maybe stasi maybe kgb hes smart gregor is 
 lets just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited of course i might have brought gregor but he didnt seem like the right candidate for this 
 exactly why not bring them 
 like larry or swede 
 so vincent why bring me along for the ride job like this calls for a warm body somebody who can stand around and look threatening a tough guy 
 there is that 
 it has its moments course you get cancer and die thats the down side 
 christ i smoke a packandahalf a day and i tell myself i could be worse its just so damned pleasurable 
 i do 
 a cigarette as in one one cigarette a week who smokes like that 
 i have i dont know maybe a cigarette a week 
 help yourself since when do you smoke 
 ones a lot more painful than the other 
 whats the difference 
 not at all similar but not the same 
 same thing isnt it 
 jujitsu 
 that was a nice move you did on our young friend judo 
 i asked if we could give him anything else 
 whatd you say to him 
 i dont but the language hes speaking is universal 
 i didnt know that you spoke french 
 and i suppose hes saying that we oughta give them something for using it huh 
 something like that 
 as in they own it 
 he says this is their block 
 thats what i thought 
 pretty much what youd expect 
 i can do that 
 to see a man about a thing 
 where to 
 things this is my country you know 
 coordinate what 
 im vincent and i coordinate 
 lets just say he knows who i am 
 he trusts you to lock up 
 no thanks 
 cigarette 
 i know cops and you are no cop 
 perhaps the police 
 who else would you be 
 what makes you think we are here to meet you 
 sorry im late 
 seamus reilly 
 last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address name of seamus reilly 
 gonna be tough 
 its the irish tape we want 
 cause the russian production company would be easier to find 
 whys that 
 im sure 
 you sure 
 gaelic 
 its an international thing several different peoples involved criminals from all over the world experts brought together to do a job but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together an unlikely group of partners 
 whats the story 
 you slept with the fucker 
 you put everything on the line because you 
 you should have kill him when you had the chance but no 
 you slept with her 
 how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us 
 you slept with her 
 why didnt you kill him 
 why didnt you kill her 
 its a matter of respect why dont you wait outside this wont take long 
 i gotta try and overcharge him he has to moan about the price we settle somewhere in the middle 
 tony and i have to talk some business first 
 i get the picture 
 seamus reilly boys a serious irish auteur a real firebrand thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peaceloving pussies if you see what im saying 
 the russian would be easier 
 can you get it 
 all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version 
 you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape 
 what i have heard so far its all a lot of talk i wasnt so sure what to make of it at first cause like i said the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix 
 i might know where you could get a copy 
 do you have the tape 
 matter of face theres this flick i have been hearing about i havent seen it but from what i hear its pretty cool 
 i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new 
 why dont we step into my office 
 a friend i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes 
 doing well this is 
 im alright and you 
 my man how you doing 
 dont lie to me 
 i dont know what you are 
 shut up not another word out of you you are going down the feds know all about it you didnt know some of it was marked did you wheres the rest 
 dwayne listen to me 
 i should kill you right here i never thought youd do this to me but i guess theres a lot i didnt know about you 
 i cant get enough of it 
 whatsamatter with you arent you concerned about all of this 
 i want to get some hounds down here 
 damn 
 none of them had any 
 id like to know what they were doing in my town did you get id off any of them 
 looks like some kind of drug deal or something they are not from around here one of thems still alive 
 what the hell happened here 
 hey dwayne why dont you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin 
 sort of 
 rock solid 
 and you are solid on that 
 uh huh 
 that will bring me down too eventually you gotta know that 
 i cant i cant go on i cant keep lyingkilling thats not me thats not us 
 just one more this one knocks off all the rest 
 its not about the money anymore cant you see that its about 
 you are the one whos nuts theres no one left to touch us booth we are home free we just plant a little of the money on dwayne and its all ours 
 yes it is im calling it in right now 
 its not too late 
 its too late 
 dwayne had the opportunity just like us he was at the scene he grabbed the cash of course this is perfect 
 what are you talking about 
 i know i know dwaynes dead but we can deal with it we will pin it on him the dea was driving jesses car no car phone no radio they couldnt have called me in 
 dwaynes dead 
 what do you mean look we can make still make it work 
 no it stops now it stops here 
 we got to get out of here do you understand we got to get out of here right now 
 he killed her 
 booth listen to mebooth 
 he found us he shot herhe killed her 
 what happened whats earl doing here 
 he killed herhe killed her 
 oh jesus 
 then sally comes too 
 thats right 
 we have got to go now then 
 we will take the money and disappear we can do it spend it on the move even if all of its marked theres ways around it 
 we are not how do you figure that 
 no we are not 
 then we are screwed 
 i dont know they got all kinds of hightech shit nowadays 
 it was all used random numbers how can they trace it 
 i dont know for sure but why else would they head for the bank 
 i sure as hell hope so lets go 
 do you have everything 
 come on booth grabs the bag 
 maybe we should say somethin 
 yes i do it never woulda stopped you know that jesses always gonna be making mistakes and wed be paying for them for the rest of our lives 
 you dont know if he was really gonna 
 we are doing what we gotta do to protect ourselves 
 jesus christ earlwhat are we doing 
 like hell it is this is jesse jesse 
 its gonna be ok 
 you killed him 
 even if we have the tape that wouldnt shut him up 
 there it isnow what about the others 
 here it is 
 im just making our intentions clear go check the desk 
 what are you thinking we were only supposed to scare him 
 i dont know shit give me a break 
 how long is it going to take 
 who said anything about killing just keep driving straight 
 not bad enough to kill him 
 how badly do you want that money how bad do you want to stay out of jail 
 you are crazy 
 i dont knowwe have to shut him up somehow booth looks at earl 
 well what are we supposed to do 
 i dont think hes going to be doing any bargaining with us the stupid sonofabitch besides im not giving him a third of anything not after everything we had to do 
 maybe we can reason with jesse give him a third in exchange for the tape 
 if you are any friend at all you will stop talking like that 
 look earl we gotta go straight this is all messed up 
 neither do i 
 no 
 you think hes bluffing 
 yeah i mean you are coming unglued jesse 
 you are out of your mind 
 well i mean it this time come on lets get this over with 
 you said that last time 
 for christs sake booth i just needed to take care of a few debts is all you got my word on it im not going near it again until everything cools down 
 we had a deal what was i talking to the wall 
 hes a partner now earl like it or not 
 hes going to be trouble 
 forget the copies he could have made up the copies the only thing that incriminates us is the original 
 hes probably made copies hes not going to give them up to us 
 all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape we will set him up somehow 
 and how do you figure we do that 
 i have got a better idea all we have to do is straighten out jesse 
 or get rid of the money i dont know 
 well doesnt he besides if the dea heard that tape wed be behind bars right now just call it the cost of doing business this whole thing is screwed up im thinking maybe we should tell em the truth 
 well im not thinks hes got us by the balls 
 all right enough im tired of thinking about all this 
 i could kill that no good son of a bitch 
 exactly this is our little secret partner 
 he would have done it to us right 
 listen do you want to go to jail taking evidence tampering with a crime scene you know what theyd do 
 thats not what i mean 
 okay then i will do it 
 i cant do that 
 well neither have i but its us or him if he talks or writes a note or whatever hes gonna turn us in besides hes just a low life scumbag his kind is hardly even human anyway 
 you are thinking about killing him i cant do that no way i have never killed a man never even shot at one 
 i dont know 
 what are you thinking 
 shit we are gonna have to get rid of him im not letting some gangbanger ruin my life we cant risk it 
 he will tell them everything to save his ass thats how they all work it 
 how long you been lying there playing possum with us huh answer me 
 man take it easy you are sweating like crazy 
 i should have known something like this was going to happen 
 its the stupid thing to do thats what it is 
 its the right thing to do 
 are you nuts they will fry us for sure theres no way we are doin that you understand no way 
 we gotta turn ourselves in before they hear the tape 
 oh right with a little help from his pals booth and earl im sure thats gonna fly real far when they hear that tape 
 no we didnt he died on his own 
 we assaulted a federal agent we killed him 
 well we didnt know that at the time 
 that guy was a federal agent an officer of the law just like us 
 i dont know you want me to put on my cape and fly there we are going to play it cool besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway 
 this isnt a joke what are we going to do 
 i dont know 
 we are dead we are dead we are dead what are we going to do 
 forget it we are going to bury it and we are not going to even think about it until everything dies down and no one i mean no one hears a word about it understand 
 fair enough i will take it to my place 
 look dwayne was right this is going to be a big story so big in fact that i dont want to even have this money around 
 well we didnt kill him he died on his own 
 i dont want to hear about miracles and god and all that we tried to murder someone to cover our asses 
 i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out 
 listen do you want to go to jail taking evidence tampering with a crime scene you know what theyd do 
 thats not what i mean 
 okay then i will do it 
 ii cant do that 
 well neither have i but its us or him if he talks or writes a note or whatever hes gonna turn us in besides hes a low life scumbag his kind is hardly even human anyway 
 you are thinking about killing him i cant do that no way i have never killed a man never even shot at one 
 i dont know 
 what are you thinking 
 im not letting some gangbanger send me to jail we cant risk it 
 he will tell them everything to save his ass thats how they all work it 
 how long you been lying there playing possum with us huh answer me 
 he saw everything 
 i dont know son of a bitch who the hell are you 
 well i dont know im putting it out of my mind and you should too 
 what are you gonna do 
 shhh 
 well we wont do any of that shit 
 we are going to be patient if we start flashing money around buying fancy cars and fancy clothes people are going to ask questions 
 whats that 
 i have got one condition 
 i dont know 
 we will leave a few packets in the trunk and stash the rest somewhere else car went up in the gunfight 
 torch it 
 we will torch the bases hows that 
 all right we will 
 i do its little shit like that sends people to jail we have to cover all the bases if we are going to pull this 
 maybe who cares 
 all right hold on lemme think shit did you touch the car 
 they killed themselves besides they were breaking the law what they were doing was wrong whatsamatter booth dont you believe in miracles 
 at the expense of six people 
 thats right 
 oh so gods like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks 
 its no accident we stumbled on this money its an answer to a prayer every night and every day i have prayed that god would just help me out a little give me a little push tonight my prayer came true 
 becausei know 
 what makes you so sure 
 i will worry about that when it happens and if it happens and its not gonna happen 
 its going to go bigger than that could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it 
 whos going to question us dwayne jesse 
 suppose someone knows about the money they are bound to ask questions 
 we would never have to worry about money ever again jesus 
 we will figure something out 
 i told trudy we were coming down this way thats why 
 why 
 it wont work 
 hell it wont be us 
 well someones gonna find them 
 come on booth look at these scumbags around us whos going to know what happened lets take it and get out of here 
 we dont know that 
 robbed a bank cmon dont you think we would have heard if one two shit i dont know how many were at large dont you think there would be a bulletin this is a big ass drug deal 
 we dont know whose money it is they might have robbed a bank who knows 
 look around you partner you said yourself you never saw anything like it 
 no we cant 
 why are you kidding me

 shit more than that 
 there must be over a million dollars in here 
 ten thousand right here 
 they are out of towners arizona plates 
 what the hell

 i probably would have i guess the clues damn near before everyone 
 oh you would have done great 
 never heard of it 
 cash and carry you know fdr world war two 
 cash and what 
 he would have won more but he blew it at the end didnt know what cash and carry was 
 seven thousand 
 yeahi remember my brotherinlaw gary the wheel watcher he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars plus some leather furniture do you think i saw any of that his excuse was the government got it all

 whats that 
 well we have one lead and thats what im looking into next 
 yes wife and a kid dont blame yourself deputy you did all you could you have our deepest gratitudeand my personal thanks 
 you mean that guy was an agent 
 normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys the last we heard from him was two days ago 
 maybe thats where it was during dennings last report 
 could it have been in the mercedes 
 because someone may have gotten away 
 no why 
 thank you now do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site on your way to or from

 yeah 
 test the product 
 hell i dont know if i had some input id offer it up 
 what do you think about all this 
 this just might be our ticket 
 i dont know 
 we had hounds down at the scene the footprint trail was a bust and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity 
 what makes you say that 
 cause we got footprints leading into that brush i want to see where it leads jesus seven dead i will tell you i have never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts i dont like it not in my jurisdiction 
 why 
 speaking of which that reminds me i have to bring something home or eat sallys meatloaf again and i dont think i could stand that 
 dont worry the real men are in charge now 
 all right deputies take care dont let your meat loaf 
 did you say after midnight 
 okthis is good our first solid lead 
 fine the information doesnt leave this room 
 dwayne it is imperative that we keep this confidential now we know someones out there very close it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner 
 dwayne 
 sheriff hogan 
 well yes i understand that we dont want them hightailing it out of here 
 well you can understand why we didnt say anything if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us 
 have you known this all along 
 we dont know whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system 
 mmhmm 
 hell no besides im just a radio call away if something happens i feel i should keep abreast of what happens seeing its my jurisdiction and all 
 dont you have to be here 
 maybe i should come along 
 oh that was agent wallace we are going to check into something 
 because they dont want anyone to hear whats on it obviously 
 why would someone do that 
 well unfortunately dennings not here to tell us but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it 
 what are you getting at 
 maybe maybe not 
 dont you think i would have told you that 
 uh no 
 we appreciate that 
 well wed like to help you in any way we can we are all in this together as law enforcement officers 
 damn martin im sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that i thought maybe it would help booth lets out an inaudible deep breath earl immediately plays up to martin clearly relieved 
 well nothing audible to us maybe the lab can pick something up 
 excellent i will go down with you 
 yeah i told him id be there before five 
 thats news to me so its over at jesses office 
 he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of whos who what was said whats happening i contacted your local coroner and he found it taped to his back 
 i wanted to ask you some questions about last night 
 i guess we can get started

 not exactly its some lingerie store on the strip 
 what the hell is that some kind of porno store or something 
 yeah

 is this marked money or what 
 mr curtis called us this afternoon the bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop came through a store called after midnight theres only four employees none of them can tell us who passed them 
 oh yeah between here and vegas we get a lot of customers all types even had an officer just like you

 with the fbi what do you think im talking about 
 howd what go 
 i wouldnt be close to you what is that perfume girl 
 whats wrong with that 
 i could get promoted right out of here

 fbi needs a taste of the street and im it 
 the feds 
 hey baby its cool captain just reassigned me to the feds

 and your buddy mr lee is on his way back to china now get out before i file obstruction of justice charges against you 
 what 
 im not interested carter you are no longer on this assignment 
 okay let me start from the top a few days ago i was on this munitions dealer named lafontaine now after the shit blew up last night 
 no sir im as good as it gets 
 why dont you try the assignment or should i call and ask for somebody who can handle it 
 oh yeah the caller was a man confident had an accent my guess asian anything else i can do for the fbi sir 
 eleven thirty tomorrow the ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is he said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity 
 dont play bullshit games with me 
 hmmmm 
 thats what you were supposed to be 
 hey man you can use her shes an expert 
 you think this is funny carter you send for someone from explosives four men just died in there 
 yo johnson 
 carter shut up 
 you understand what im sayin 
 try a bus load of no make that two bus loads of chinese 
 what do you mean you lost him how could you lose him 
 just make him think you are following leads interview some suspects look at fingerprints do detective shit i dont care i just dont want to see him or you for that matter until this is resolved now we want to make a good impression dont we his plane lands in an hour dont be late 
 what the hell am i supposed to do with him take him to the zoo 
 because with your special talents im sure you will do a better job 
 why dont you assign one of your own men to this 
 bottom line i dont want some chung king cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident 
 what kind of assignment is that 
 dont worry about the kidnapping carter the fbi will handle that your assignment is lee 
 im talking about the girl 
 he is the situation 
 sir hes just gonna get in my way if im gonna handle this situation 
 the director considers this top priority considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances his name is lee and he is to be shown every courtesy within reason 
 interrogation is one a my specialties but undercover work is my forte 
 you come highly recommended carter and your particular assignment requires a special talent 
 how much they want 
 at this point we dont have much 
 any demands yet 
 you dont he finds you through his people 
 where do we find him 
 im waitin here for a name 
 you sonuvabitch 
 all i gotta do is implicate the feds can do a lot with a good implication even if you dont get sparky i will bet you get ten to twenty more plenty of time to find a nice fella 
 how did i do this maybe you didnt notice but im in jail 
 you are movin to death row see your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of four fbi agents and when i turn this into the lab they are gonna find lafontaine all over it and we already know this is your mo 
 what are you talking about 
 you got a boy friend in here yet cause you are gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye 
 do it 
 okay look we are gonna make a trade you cross the street leave her on the sidewalk i will leave him on this side then we trade places you get him i get her get the picture lois 
 i wouldnt touch that if i were you 
 whats this little green wire coming out one side of the package 
 what are you talking about 
 you know something every time i see this stuff it reminds me ofuha double latte grande with two shots of nonfat milk 
 shit i aint interested in puttin my hands on you that does nothin for me no i dont need to be pattin no ass all im sayin is how do i know you are not a cop 
 nobody touches me 
 i oughta pat your ass down make sure you are not a cop 
 i dont trust anybody especially first time deals 
 this is not a good way to start a relationship stickin a gun to a mans head feelin around his personal equipment make him think you dont trust him 
 or somethin 
 you a cop or something 
 shut up 
 hey hey you start touching me there im gonna start movin word up mother

 and what did you say 
 only respectful things what did we have in common back then what kind of music did you like did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar 
 what did he ask 
 yes yes im sure i only did you good maggie 
 what you talked to him did you tell him we dated before you were a priest 
 actually he only asked me one ridiculous question the rest werent so bad 
 hes here hes here 
 i will get the dress

 its hurting 
 we do it to our dog 
 eight is good v could be victory 
 and in a v 
 okay have a seat gently carefully 
 thats it back to obedience school 
 yes rubbing your ears is very soothing cory does that to me when i hyperventilate 
 rub your ears 
 his hair any color 
 i love his eyes i just believe they are listening to you 
 never say die 
 nothing but net 
 make the shot 
 sink the putt

 where do you think shes going 
 maggie 
 im sorry too wow that only took us between years to say 
 well im sorry im really sorry ellie 
 no no you didnt 
 is that what i did to you is that what happened did i just not see you 
 but one of those guys not one of them knew her at all each one was convinced that she was perfect for them but they didnt see her and she never showed up so they couldnt see her its a very symbolic thing happening she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be 
 fisher let him talk 
 im sorry ike this is permanent 
 see you want custody of my job why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel i have served my time 
 i already made an appointment for later today 
 lawyers i dont know ellie firing me is going to be very tough on you its going to be hard to get over there will be therapy bills for you 
 i merely write the stuff you are the one that serves it up 
 no thats what makes you unemployed 
 someone reliable im sure a booze hound in a bar 
 i didnt cook up a story i had a source 
 thats not nothing to do with it you cooked this story up and you know it 
 lesson number two never work for your former spouse 
 journalism lesson number one if you fabricate your facts you get fired 
 what 
 its for you ike 
 so i never returned your calls even when we were married and whats fisher doing here anyway 
 i left four messages you dont return my calls 
 fully i like her she has wit 
 poor ike 
 look hes in pretty good shape 
 look hes running after her 
 or does she pick ngbs nice guys but nice guys but im cheap nice guys but he lives with his mom nice guys but he just out of prison 
 or a vegetarian 
 just call me when you have it ike how is the story coming is she a maneater 
 overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout thats new york living 
 i just found out im best man im lucky i have a suit whats wrong 
 your job is the ring do you have the ring 
 i have no idea what im doing 
 go talk to the pastor and he will tell you what to do and someone will tell me what to do 
 well im good i dont know if im best 
 then you will be my best man 
 of course we are of course 
 whoa ike getting a complex buddy 
 no they are interesting guys each one of these guys has something going for him i mean ones been up everest anothers become a priest ones a pretty good guitar player and this guy today tried to end world hunger if you can believe that 
 order out like a philistine when you got the galloping gourmet here 
 okay we will order out 
 then come for dinner 
 yeah 
 you are coming here 
 look i will be in there later today i will come by and tell you all about it 
 i dont know 
 no im paying for the dress do you think shes still gonna run 
 this is about her negative attention not mine did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet 
 yes well my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention negative attention is attention like when women whack you on the street because of your column thats negative attention 
 oh yeah i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car 
 dont say spec like its a dirty word nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play plato never got a book advance 
 but i will get my normal fee right 
 justice yes paid i dont know they like the idea but my hands are tied with budget restraints 
 paid vindication thats what i call justice 
 then you have got it if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands you will have plenty of time before her next wedding trot 
 okay you were right i hated my column but i can do this assignment 
 if she runs then its a cover story all true all accurate 
 this is good it is a good story fish 
 it wouldnt be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again 
 the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland 
 all the gory details 
 the real story on miss carpenter 
 vindication how would you like to get some a chance to prove that though your facts werent entirely straight your theory was correct 
 what are you trying to say to me fish 
 ike i really liked the runaway bride piece and since i do freelance stuff for gq im in a different position now 
 dont knock drunk guys in bars drunk guys in bars are good it means they are not driving 
 in vino veritas 
 since when does ellie need moral supp 
 ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support 
 oh please 
 unbelievable she got to you 
 no i call it like i see it im a journalist im a truth teller 
 and you defending her 
 i dont know im working on it i was on the wrong track 
 why do you think she ran 
 i dont think thats why she ran 
 same as you said what did you call her a maneater a devouring death goddess 
 neuter a locust feed the world 
 not bad i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me

 i had it under control now they feel sorry for me 
 no maggie i defended you humiliating you is what everyone else is doing its the theme of this party 
 you humiliated me 
 im the only goddamn person in there pulling for you

 yes 
 are you all right with this you think this is funny 
 excuse me 
 i dont know give me a minute are you all right with this 
 missed me bad huh 
 where did you disappear to 
 yes it is and it doesnt mean anything

 yeah its kind of nice 
 kind of isolated 
 wrenches my dads gonna love that one 
 of what 
 first i have to find some tools i need a half and a ninesixtenth 
 can you fix it 
 your filters clogged this takes unleaded 
 why dont you let him sleep it off in the trunk i will take you for a ride then we will come back for him keep an eye on him

 no im cleaning an attic i wouldnt attempt the impossible 
 hmmm figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album you are not trying to soften me up are you 
 no you take it 
 its valuable hang onto it 
 it was in the attic it was jus sitting there gathering dust 
 oh my god its miles davis this is king of blue this is the original recording hard to find in good condition where did you find this 
 gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss 
 ike hi grandma 
 you know theres no 
 tell me when you get to the altar will you spike the bouquet 
 what was that i cant order my eggs without sarcasm 
 of course 
 i will have the same 
 bob will be very happy 
 fine the newspapers upside down thats better than fine 
 you look uh you look fine 
 agreed 
 even with everything thats happened i have still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress 
 maybe you should ask her some time ever thought of that 
 no 
 you dont know 
 i dont know 
 now thats romantic a proposal like that and you didnt find eternal bliss what went wrong 
 no i think i said something eloquent like so uh maybe we should ya know what do you think 
 so is that what you said to her 
 im a work in progress 
 maybe its just me but if you got to dress it up it doesnt ring true 
 what do you mean it was incredibly romantic 
 highly suspect 
 it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life cal ripken even applauded 
 hes an entomologist i thought it was very unique 
 its a little silence of the lambs for me i cant believe you waited for the wedding to run 
 still sweet 
 always a mood killer 
 what an incredible chauvinistic observation 
 well im impressed absolutely incredible i didnt expect pink and lacy but this isnt exactly a womans room 
 no im not afraid just maybe someday 
 you afraid to try 
 maybe someday 
 i like it this whole thing is pretty incredible i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york 
 i think so 
 cindy the manicurist 
 its a birthday present for my cousin put your finger in 
 done 
 sixfifty 
 five hundred 
 sevenfifty 
 too much 
 because i think you are writing on spec and with a first person interview you might actually sell that thing 
 you have seen the postits i have already got more juicy material than i need why should i pay you dollar one 
 oh but making up the facts as you go along is ethical actually i meant you you probably got severance or expenses or both i will take your check no credit cards 
 my magazine doesnt pay because for stories its not what you call ethical 
 really 
 my point is that one again you are getting it all wrong that wont improve your reputation any and its not very flattering to me either so im going to give you a chance to write the truth 
 im not a boastful man whats your point 
 you are welcome your notes made interesting bedtime reading if you like trashy fiction your observations are distorted ungrounded an incomplete you must be very proud 
 how do i do it im not that beautiful 
 i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers 
 obviously im not the only one who doesnt understand it the uss maggie leaves quite a wake excuse me 
 you misinterpret everything we have all been friends our whole lives but thats the types of relationship you wouldnt understand 
 you can turn that finger around 
 you have been here for three minutes what did you do to her 
 he is not 
 look look man i think the man is heartbroken 
 but the most interesting thing here is that i dont see the rose tattoo that i have heard about on your back 
 give me that 
 a prewedding luau 
 grandma made me the cutest outfit i cant wait to show it to you 
 nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak 
 we think so 
 how romantic 
 without oxygen 
 really 
 twice 
 everest is that right 
 despite what you think i dont do it on purpose and i have no intention of doing it again 
 thats fair 
 id love to stay and chat but i have got to get back to work i still have my job 
 we will see 
 you are going to be very disappointed 
 yes conviction conviction that im onto the truth you are going to do the same thing to poor bastard number four that you did to the last three you are going to run again and im not leaving until you do 
 did something happen to make you care about reality 
 you have one 
 im not here to make you feel bad im here for vindication in my heart 
 yes 
 weird dreams you are going to tell me about them 
 nervous not at all no i have never been more certain in my life except i am having all kinds of weird dreams 
 getting nervous 
 you will answer my questions 
 well instead of a haircut how about a wash you know get all that city grit out of it 
 excellent 
 originality is my speciality 
 i hope you have a different angle its pretty much all been covered 
 quick very quick 
 thank you you still think that he was 
 wedding wedding you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row 
 what are you talking about 
 okay 
 no im just going to head home 
 want to go to butchs for a drink or something 
 im just finishing up too 
 you okay im closing 
 no sauntering down the aisle just make time lets just get there 
 lets go 
 not eight 
 you and your lucky geese you always see geese 
 no no i saw eight geese flying in a v 
 hes not coming watch hes not coming 
 see this is a mature relationship shes really found it 
 grandma 
 its for the bell 
 i dont even want to talk about the luau whats this 
 what happened at the luau 
 yep i want him to be front and center and to watch everything 
 hes going to be the pastor 
 would it 
 i havent seen him in twentyfour hours it just gives me the creeps a little bit id feel better if i knew where he was 
 this party is for you and bob get your mind off the reporter 
 lighten up what 
 lighten up wahine 
 thanks will you fix my hair 
 you are right its not funny now maybe we both grew up 
 its only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt its not anymore 
 something that brings warmth to my heart duckbill platypus 
 i think you are right is there anything i can do to make it up to you 
 im not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you are irreversibly screwed up but maggie you have been like this since we were kids and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts peoples feelings maybe its time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own like bob if hes the one 
 peggy theres distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up despite that i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory and i beg your forgiveness 
 no you are quirky quirky and weird are two different things 
 but im weird 
 no im weird weird and mysterious are two different things 
 but you havent lost your mystery you are very mysterious 
 no i dont think you are like im charming and mysterious in a way that even i dont understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you very hard to compete with especially to us married women who have lost our mystery 
 because you think im all like hey man check me out 
 why 
 im going to kill myself 
 on anything male that moves as opposed to anything male that doesnt move 
 i know i think sometimes you just sort of spazout with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves 
 yes 
 thank you do you think i flirt with cory 
 good morning to you too you look good 
 he looks better with that stuff out of his hair hes an attractive man 
 over there ten oclock hes talking to our little dennis dennis will turn into one of those sources say things 
 where 
 there he is snoop doggydogg 
 not that he doesnt deserve to get fired look corys going for second sneaky 
 ya think 
 its probably because you got him fired 
 thats what he says but if he thinks that i dont realize hes writing another article then hes an idiot 
 for what reason some personal satisfaction 
 okay hes on base can we talk about my life now ikes going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal that i was never serious about gill blah blah hes totally out to get me 
 shes the boss 
 hold on nobody interviews maggie in here unless they are getting haircut 
 yup 
 reporter 
 stop it when you talk like that i get turned on and it frightens me 
 i didnt even need to change this gasket just put in a little hydraulic fluid 
 you are a goddess 
 yes i have seen it and i have to say its the rudest and most offensive joke anybodys ever played on me 
 so mag you have seen this huh 
 no its humiliating and you have been doing it since i was a kid i dont like it stop you may not like having a daughter with problems but guess what i dont like having a father whos drunk all the time i will eat in my room 
 a harmless joke 
 no its my life 
 maggie its just a joke 
 just stop it dont say another word like that 
 what 
 thank you dad 
 im really rooting for this one 
 i changed it see you later mr travis that guy has a problem maggie you can run everyones life but your own 
 his name is skipper dad steady 
 good boy port hole 
 im not exactly having fun either steady 
 not this one this ones on me 
 so i have come to see it as a bonus really that we have been able to plan and pay for so many weddings 
 maybe she hasnt read the paper 
 yeah 
 you know its just possible that she hasnt read this yet 
 no 
 no no you are her best friend 
 no you tell her 
 you tell maggie 
 and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isnt honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race before the rice hits the ground holy moly 
 what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar i cant ready anymore 
 so you are angry big deal 
 you turn it on you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time 
 what am i going to do with a microwave 
 you take the microwave 
 thats good 
 how about you are too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long term way 
 nope 
 you dont love me is that it 
 nope 
 is there somebody else 
 theres no why annie im just not up for it i never said i was 
 no thats free hes an architect used to do big highprofile projects he scaled it all back when his wife died now he remodels peoples homes he works in a small firm makes a good living 
 i hope i dont have to pay for that piece of information 
 its on the lake right in the middle of seattle it rains nine months of the year in seattle 
 but its on the water 
 its not a boat boat its really a house 
 boats all anyone talks about is the wind is it up is it down i cant live with a man who only talks about the wind 
 houseboats dont go anywhere 
 boats you go out in them you come back in them i hate them 
 it sounds nice 
 i hate boats 
 hes got a houseboat 
 tell me hes living in squalor tell me everything he has is being repossessed including his filthy dented mobile home 
 look 
 what 
 oh 
 yes some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony 
 you okay 
 i think thats what im saying 
 oh walter i dont deserve you 
 not really look annie i love you lets leave that out of it i dont want to be someone you are settling for i dont want to be someone anyone settles for i have a life insurance policy im fully invested in growth stocks i have a paid subscription to home rox office i have no sexual diseases i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isnt soft i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth i dress nicely i am a member of the private sector an independent voter i dont watch monday night football the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat strawberries penicillin pollen nuts and wool there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring if you dont marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it isnt it 
 im not at the top of the empire state building im here 
 at the top of the empire state building 
 i told you nothing 
 so what happened 
 yes but it wasnt really it was just 
 it was a betrayal 
 i dont know what to say about it walter it was a form of temporary insanity but i had to tell you about it because 
 walter theres something i have to tell you 
 beautiful view isnt it 
 its so beautiful its just what i would have picked out if id had every ring in the world to choose from you see what i mean there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises but i am not one of them surprises are highly overrated 
 it was my mothers 
 walter 
 its just like my grandmothers china

 hes allergic to everything dont worry about it 
 dont touch them i feel terrible sneezing at a time like this this is a big moment for me 
 they are going to love you 
 am i what they had in mind 
 i hope he doesnt get out his slides 
 your uncle milton lost all his money in a puerto rican condominium that went belly up dont mention the irs or the federal prison system your mother is barbara your father is cliff 
 who is the most competitive woman in the world 
 and your brother tom is a psychology professor and is married tobetsy 
 because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didnt 
 harold who ran away with his secretary but came back 
 whos married to 
 the short one with black hair is your cousin irene 
 i hate it im so happy becky finally i feel happy this is right this is real everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts please dont tell anyone about what happened sleepless in seattle is history 
 i love the symphony 
 we are going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night 
 what are your plans in new york 
 no im not 
 you are going to miss the train 
 it doesnt mean anything it was written before i went out there before the ho 
 what about the letter 
 im going to run back to walters arms if hes still have me 
 so he cant write big deal i mean verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble 
 made for each other 
 mfeo 
 dear annie thanks for your letter it was great we are very excited about meeting you in new york on valentines day and seeing if we are mfeo sleepless in seattle 
 so i mailed your letter 
 becky 
 well its the same woman and he was crazy about her what is this this is from seattle 
 this is a photo of hair 
 i saw her she looked just like this 
 you dont know who she was annie 
 its a sign i have watched this movie too many times im so stupid from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio i have been a complete jerk 
 its a sign 
 he said hello 
 but he saw you right 
 that was nothing compared to this humiliation nothing 
 i love that dream 
 you know that dream where you are walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you 
 you were standing in the middle of the street 
 good night 
 i love you too 
 thank you i love you 
 no thats the weirdest part about it 
 is this crazy 
 what 
 becky 
 okay good goodbye 
 thats not what i mean im going back over there tomorrow and talk to him i am 
 you told a lie and got on a plane 
 i couldnt do it how did i get here 
 did you talk to him 
 definitely 
 youd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it 
 i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows 
 the kid is on you have got me listening to this garbage go on turn it on 
 what 
 turn on your radio 
 hello 
 i always wondered about that too 
 do you think at the end of the movie when shes in the wheelchair they can still do it 
 i know 
 men never get this movie 
 listen to this i love this part 
 plus he fell in love with a temp 
 and then you left him he lost weight there and you left him 
 yes 
 no 
 can too 
 thats impossible a guy cant 
 he lost all the weight there 
 you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet 
 you want to hear about destiny if my husband hadnt gone on a diet which caused me to leave him i would never have been on that flight to miami and met rick and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a N with that nob you slide that says vacantoccupied vacant occupied vacantoccupied 
 good perfect i will be in new york with walter i can squeeze it in 
 on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentines day 
 i want to meet you 
 your destiny can be your doom look at me and rick 
 i dont know i mean what if i never meet him what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him 
 what 
 i should say something in this about magic 
 right 
 im going to marry walter i just have to get this out of my system 
 you are you are losing your mind what about walter 
 i know that you think i dont know that i know thats a dumb way to begin but its the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio on the other hand maybe im just losing my mind 
 and this woman is a writer thats what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers 
 i am not the sort of person who listens to callin radio shows 
 it sounds like the name of a mattress store 
 dear sleepless and son 
 movie thats your problem you dont want to be in love you want to be in love in a movie read it to me 
 they knew it time distance nothing could separate them because they knew it was right it was real it was 
 you are a basket case 
 not 
 oh oh really now we are getting down to it 
 actually he sounded nice 
 and now N women want his number the guy could be a crackhead a psychopath a flasher a junkie a transvestite a chainsaw murderer or someone really sick like rick 
 thats what she called him on the show because he cant sleep 
 sleepless in seattle 
 nothings with me 
 whats with you 
 what was what 
 what was that about up there 
 theres practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true 
 its not true but it feels true 
 whatever it is 
 about what 
 you should write something about this 
 you want a tail i got a guy in seattle 
 no not remotely i just want to find out about him 
 oh like glenn close in that movie 
 i will tell you the truth i heard this guy on a callin radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i have become obsessed with him 
 a sense of humor 
 no no no its more like who is he does he have a sense of humor is he nice no forget nice i have got nice 
 so you want a financial is he a deadbeat we can do a d and b 
 no i know that part 
 do you want a matrimonial past wives any kids 
 she has a pattern of getting involved with losers once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus 
 okay 
 i need to know about him because hes involved with my sister 
 thats what im going to do im going to go home i quit laurie i quit im going back to baltimore how does a blonde do a high five 
 go home for the weekend 
 i want my money 
 maybe you should see a shrink 
 i know 
 he wasnt even wrong for you like cosmically wrong so dont beat up on yourself for wastinghowever long it was 
 i know 
 honey he wasnt right for you 
 howard 
 howard 
 hi jonah sam and who is this 
 im jonah thats my dad his name is sam 
 yes 
 are you annie 
 come on jonah 
 oh god its major hes kissing her on the lips i have to stop this 
 how am i going to explain this to walter 
 this is a complete disaster i wanted him to find a wife but hes got the wrong one 
 this is a grotesque violation of this mans personal life but never mind 
 please 
 and you crazy he thinks shows like this are dumb if you didnt have an N number i could never get away with this 
 perfect sandbag the father 
 any time 
 thank you tom i feel so much better just having blown this off 
 yes i did 
 i know i know i do not want to move to seattle but what i really dont want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something what do you think its just cold feet isnt it everyone panics before they get married didnt you 
 it rains nine months of the year in seattle 
 i dont even know him but im having all these fantasies about a man i have never met who lives in seattle 
 annie when you meet someone and you are attracted to them it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious subconsciously so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match 
 but when you met her did you believe she was the only person for you that in some mystical cosmic way it was fated 
 i got married because betsy said we had to break up or get married so we get married 
 i mean why did you get married was it all fireworks and trumpets and 
 what 
 i think im going crazy tom i really do are you happily married 
 you dont believe in signs 
 its a sign 
 so you will get married in a new dress 
 like clockwork 
 well fine fine fiddle da dee and hows it working 
 mom we already 
 of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department so dont be worried if it takes a while 
 mom 
 i knew we would be together forever and that everything would be wonderful just the way you feel about walter walter its quite a formal name isnt it one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time in the sack i believe you call it 
 magic 
 magic it was magic 
 what 
 you know 
 what 
 i was in atlantic city with my family cliff was a waiter he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier i have probably told you this a million times but i dont care and then he held my hand i was scared all sorts of thing were going through my head but after a while i forgot about them at one point i looked down at our hands and i couldnt tell which fingers were mine and which were his and i knew 
 it wasnt a sign it was a coincidence 
 then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna 
 oh please destinys just something we have invented because we cant stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental 
 destiny takes a hand 
 it is isnt it you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life 
 how amazing 
 its silly really i mean id seen him at the office obviously id seen him hes the associate publisher and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat which of course he was allergic to and i got his lettuce and tomato on white 
 how did it happen 
 you will love them we are going down to dc tonight to be with them christmas morning 
 are his folks nice 
 i know hes wonderful isnt he 
 i notice these things are back in fashion oh honey hes a lovely man annie 
 grannys dress oh mom 
 the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them 
 we will move them 
 its probably just the flowers 
 walter and i are engaged 
 everybody annie has an announcement 
 the one in the street i chased after you 
 its me 
 its you 
 shhhh 
 hi so far so good so what should we talk about how insecure we were in high school shirley votypka the first girl i ever felt up health what about health did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak 
 hi 
 hello 
 hello 
 magic 
 magic 
 you touch her for the first time and suddenly you are home its almost like 
 sure you do 
 sure you do 
 thanks but i will pass its kind of a big night i dont like to leave jonah alone 
 sam if you are not doing anything new years obviously you are not doing anything new years we are having some people over all of them married not one even remotely interested in playing around does that sound great or what i cant think of the last time i was at a party when anything actually happened 
 why me what about jay 
 the point is take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we wont have to redo the kitchen cabinets 
 grace the dispatcher great 
 grace heard it 
 great this is great the whole town knows just out of curiosity how do you two know 
 the cabinets have to be redone 
 which means 
 and if i could describe it it probably wouldnt be on a radio show but what the hell its not one specific thing its more of a feeling 
 why not 
 i dont think i could really describe it 
 what was it that made you know 
 i dont know when i met my wife it was so clear i just knew 
 what are you going to do sam 
 its hard to imagine 
 do you think theres somebody out there you could love as much as your wife maybe even more 
 whats she talking about 
 we have been talking to well lets just call him sleepless in seattle and we will be right back after this break with listener response your response to the things we have been discussing the number to call is 
 and i dont want to invade your privacy 
 look doctor i dont want to be rude but 
 why not 
 no 
 have you had any relationship since 
 its been about a year and a half 
 good how long ago did your wife die 
 all righ 
 i think its hard for him to talk to you about all this maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better 
 im not mad at you okay im not mad at you 
 jesus are we on the air jonah for gods sake 
 dr marcia fieldstone of network america 
 who is this 
 im not selling anything your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife 
 im probably not interested in whatever you are selling 
 hello sam this is dr marcia fieldstone on network america 
 hello 
 tell her how you dont sleep at night 
 i have no doubt that you are a good dad you can tell a lot from a persons voice but something must be missing if jonah feels that you are still under a cloud 
 fair enough 
 okay but if i get yelled at im never gonna listen to this show again 
 im sure he wont be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him 
 i dont know 
 well i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly 
 yeah 
 is he home right now 
 you want me to talk to him 
 its very hard for him to talk about this stuff its like it makes him sadder 
 why not 
 no 
 im worried about him hes worried about me i ride my bike to school he follows in the car like im not supposed to know hes there now its christmas and you know what happens to people at christmas 
 and you are worried about him 
 i have been pretty sad but i think my dad is worse 
 im sorry to hear that jonah 
 she died 
 wheres your mom 
 he doesnt have one now thats the problem 
 you dont like the one he was now 
 its not for me its for my dad i think he needs a new wife 
 got me there whats your christmas wish jonah 
 its not that late in seattle 
 no last names jonah hello there you sound younger than our usual callers how come you are up so late 
 right right 
 it is not 
 it is easier to be killed by a terrorist 
 no 
 how about rapacious and love starved

 was mom an adjustment 
 jonah this isnt fair you dont know victoria i hardly know her myself she is in fact a mystery to me she tosses her hair a lot why does she do this i have no idea is it a twitch does she need a haircut should she use barrette so it doesnt keep falling in her face these are things that im willing to get to the bottom of and that is why i am dating her that is all i am doing i am not marrying her can you appreciate the difference thats what single people do they try people on and they see if they fit but nobody fits perfectly everyone is an adjustment 
 if she knew shed never forgive me it would be hopeless for the two of you 
 this is not a joke thank god victoria doesnt know it would really have hurt her feelings 
 its a short word 
 long enough to call victoria a ho 
 i just called for a second 
 everyone at work heard you 
 no

 the water tastes better in the kitchen

 i uh have a date with someone friday night 
 i know but shes here jonah because i have you and as long as i have you i have your mom 
 im starting to forget her 
 i never did or the whole idea of an afterlife but i dont know any more i have these dreams about your mom and we have long talks about about you and how you are which she sort of knows but i tell her anyway so what is that its sort of an afterlife isnt it 
 like do you believe in heaven 
 i dont know 
 i miss her what do you think happens to someone after they die 
 is that what she used to sing 
 bye bye blackbird 
 you are worried we are going to be all right we are going to be all right i remember sometimes youd have nightmares as a baby your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song 
 our house there was water coming in all the windows 
 what was 
 it was sinking 
 how do you know 
 i know 
 dad this is amazing if you play this backwards it says paul is dead 
 its nice to meet you jessica 
 hi dad dad this is jessica 
 go to sleep 
 jeds got cables 
 whose show was this on 
 in the movies women are always scratching up guys back and screaming and stuff when they are having sex 
 what 
 will she scratch up your back 
 what do you think 
 if you get a new wife i guess you will have sex with her huh 
 im starting to notice that 
 it doesnt they ask you 
 but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you are halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if its just a drink if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you dont you can go home if you see what i mean i wonder if it still works this way 
 a slice of pizza 
 you see someone you like you get a feeling about them you ask them if they want to have a drink or 
 english muffin how do you do it 
 this is not how you do it you want this on an english muffin or a bun 
 dad you are not taking this seriously 
 she looks like my third grade teacher i hated my third grade teacher hold it wait a minute she is my third grade teacher 
 shes willing to fly anywhere 
 im not going to think about what they are not teaching you in school i am not going to think about it generally speaking i think we should rule out people who dont live somewhere near here

 you could have called me 
 i really wanted you to call me and i thought you were never going to 
 you did 
 i thought you were never going to call me 
 you look good yourself 
 you look good 
 hi 
 hi

 are you going to let us pass or do i have to call the sheriff 
 no my name is quintero mister quintero 
 i mean it i know your work record you were in line for foreman when this trouble started did you know that you had a real future with this company but you let those reds stir you up and now they will sell you down the river why dont you wake up ray thats your name isnt it ray 
 thats none of their affair 
 the men would like to know who this gentleman is 
 no thanks 
 you are welcome to one 
 naturally you think i parked here for a cup of coffee 
 want to go up to your office mr alexander 
 your foreman says thats a foremans job 
 why didnt you give a warning signal 
 i told you it would happen its bound to happen when a man works alone 
 i dont make policy 
 got any more ideas 
 no just the ring leaders the fireeaters and the ones with big families barton wheres that boy 
 you want em all arrested 
 you havent tried locking them up 
 i have tried everything but shootin em down 
 well 
 now dont get excited mr alexander they will scatter like a covey of quail 
 whose side are you on anyway 
 not so sure about that letter of the law you know all the injunction says is no picketing by miners 
 well those new fellows you hired from out of town we brought em up here in a truck this morning but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail 
 hows it going 
 mornin 
 you know whats good for the goose is good for the gander 
 what do you mean sex equality 
 he says give em equality equality in jobs equality in the home also sex equality 
 so what does he want to do about em 
 question question the problem what to do about em 
 the woman question 
 its like charley vidal says theres two kinds of slavery wage slavery and domestic slavery the woman question he calls it 
 yeah 
 three hours just to heat enough water to wash this stuff i tell you something if this strike is ever settled which i doubt i dont go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us it should have been a union demand from the beginning 
 it never ends 
 how goes it 
 you cant send him back to oklahoma itd be inhumane 
 jenkins aint no boss mean we are gonna let people like jenkins stay here 
 no no its the president of the company himself come all the way out here to make jenkins general manager so why you acting so mean 
 its the paymaster from moscow with our gold 
 now why dont you let these gentlemen pass dont you know whos in that car 
 i say we gotta take action now 
 take a drink calm down 
 you are a liar pancho a nogood dirty 
 you werent even there you were back at the station kalinsky told me 
 i checked the drift just before he blasted it was all clear the man must have been asleep or something 
 an american 
 who a scab 
 you work alone savvy you cant handle the job i will find someone who can 
 foreman wants to get the ore out miner wants to get his brothers out in one piece 
 he will if he wants us to go on blasting 
 now wait a minute supers the one made the rule he aint gonna give you no helper 
 so much the better 
 supers busy with your negotiatin committee 
 you know the beef this new rule of yours that we work alone we are taking it up with the super 
 hear you had a little trouble quintero defective fuse well you are all in one piece so whats the beef 
 yes we will light the candles 
 can we light the candles now on the cake 
 they are singing for me 
 why are they singing mama 
 hush not a word about the cake hear 
 mama can i put the candles 
 later when i finish the ironing 
 are you sad are we going to church for your confession 
 no estellita 
 are you sick mama 
 with ramn its pride i spoke out of the bitterness in me and he was hurt 
 so they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman and they run away 
 good come in we will work it out sit down sit down 
 its all set consuelos squad can take they day off tomorrow we are taking over 
 dont you worry we will get some action 
 he cant drink this milk it will make him sick hes on a formula i was a fool i shouldnt have kept him with me 
 no no i cant if ramn ever found me on a picket line 
 come on esperanza how about it we got to 
 sure where they are negotiating in the company office we will go up there and picket the place 
 to the mine 
 this means they have given up trying to break the picket line now we can all fight together all of us 
 what are you saying 
 this is what we have been waiting for 
 and if you cant understand this you are a fool because you cant win this strike without me you cant win anything without me 
 will you be still 
 whose neck shall i stand on to make me feel superior and what will i get out of it i dont want anything lower than i am im low enough already i want to rise and push everything up with me as i go 
 shut up you are talking crazy 
 yes i talk of dignity the anglo bosses look down on you and you hate them for it stay in your place you dirty mexican thats what they tell you but why must you say to me stay in your place do you feel better having someone lower than you 
 you talk of dignity after what you have been doing 
 no you dont have you learned nothing from this strike why are you afraid to have me at your side do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none 
 i dont know what you are talking about 
 charleys my friend i need friends why are you afraid to have me as your friend 
 charley vidal says dont throw charley vidal up to me 
 i dont know but i can feel it coming its like like a lull before the storm charley vidal says 
 like what 
 ramn were not getting weaker we are stronger than ever before they are getting weaker they thought they could break our picket line and they failed and now they cant win unless they pull off something big and pull it off fast 
 who said anything about giving up i will never go back to the company on my knees never 
 you mean you are ready to give up 
 aah they have got other mines you dont see the larger picture they have got millions millions they can outlast us and they know it 
 its a lot to them theyd do anything to open that mine 
 and you know why because the company knows they can starve us out even if it takes another two three months whats it to them if the mines shut down a little longer 
 whose funeral we are doing all right there hasnt been a scab near the picket line for three days 
 sure the standby squad standby for the funeral 
 but you are needed especially now with most of the other men away you are captain of the standby squad 
 why not im not needed here 
 ramn you cant 
 no 
 alone 
 sun up 
 when 
 hunting 
 where are you going 
 no we cant cant go on this way we cant go back to the old way either 
 we cant go on this way i just cant go on living with you not this way 
 tell me 
 but you wanted to talk tell me 
 be still 
 that meeting only lasted ten minutes the first night im home and you run to the beer parlor what is it cant you bear the sight of me 
 you werent waiting for me 
 i waited up till midnight 
 yes to plan for the picket line tomorrow 
 a meeting 
 all right but later i have got a meeting now 
 we have got to have a talk you and me 
 no no the sheriff had enough of us we drove him crazy 
 but if you go back they will lock you up again 
 no no we wouldnt do it 
 did you have to sign a pledge not to go back to the line 
 we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in 
 four nights how did you sleep 
 im okay but its nice to be home 
 how do you feel 
 okay then tomorrow i take the kids with me to the picket line 
 im telling you i dont stay home with these kids tomorrow 
 i have had them since the day they were born 
 you might get hurt listen if you think im gonna play nursemaid from now on you are crazy i have had these kids all day 
 im going back tomorrow 
 i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime huh 
 yes 
 must have been some experience for you huh 
 sure 
 you all right 
 backward 
 can be what 
 anglo husbands can also be backward 
 theres jenkins wife you dont see her on no picket line 
 no she wants to be there and theres mrs kalinsky 
 shes the organizers wife shes got to be there 
 yes i do theres ruth barnes 
 the union dont run my house those anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves but you dont see any of them down there 
 but the motion passed its its not democratic of you to 
 no 
 its not fair i should be there with them after all im the one who got the women the vote 
 cant you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time 
 but its yours i wont let them 
 i dont want your dead body i dont want you back in jail either 
 over my dead body 
 let them take it 
 because if we lose we lose more than a strike we lose the union and the men know this and if we win we win more than a few demands we win something bigger hope hope for our kids juanito cant grow strong on milk alone 
 what makes you so sure 
 not just juanito you will have it good too esperanza we are going to win this strike 
 id lie on my cot in the cell and i couldnt sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat and id say to myself think of something nice something beautiful and then id think of you and my heart would pound against the cot for love of you 
 you are no good to me in jail 
 they say i am no good to you 
 what were they saying about you in there 
 he will have it good some day 
 drink drink juanito you will never have it so good 
 he was born fighting and born hungry 
 a fighter huh 
 have mercy on this child let this child live 
 mother of god have mercy 
 its nothing just a little catch 
 whats the matter 
 i did forget lus told me 
 forgive me for saying you never thought of me 
 antonio paid for it 
 was it expensive the beer 
 no no 
 im a fool 
 i did not mean to weep again why should i weep for joy 
 aaah whats the use 
 never never never 
 stop it the children are watching stop it 
 if i think of myself its because you never think of me never never never 
 is that all you care about that radio cant you think of anything except yourself 
 all right have your strike i will have my baby but no hospital will take me because i will be a strikers wife the store will cut off our credit and the kids will go hungry and we will get behind on the payments again and then they will come and take away the radio 
 esperanza have you forgotten what it was like before the union came when estella was a baby and we couldnt even afford a doctor when she got sick it was for our families we met in graveyards to build that union 
 what has it got me your union 
 now dont start talking against the union again 
 i see the men you will strike maybe for your demands but what the wives want that comes later always later 
 first we got to get equality on the job then we will work on these other things leave it to the men 
 the safety of the men thats more important five accidents this week all because of speedup you are a woman you dont know what its like up there 
 whats more important than sanitation 
 we cant get everything at once right now we have got more important demands 
 what 
 we did it got lost in the shuffle 
 do you think i like living this way what do you want of me 
 forget it i chop wood for the stove five times a day every time i remember i remember that across the tracks the anglo miners have hot water in pipes and bathrooms inside 
 forget it 
 im sorry the fires gone out 
 this waters cold again 
 got to talk to the brothers 
 where you going 
 i listen to it every night when you are out to the beer parlor 
 but you had to have it didnt you it was so nice to listen 
 it isnt right she says was it right that we bought this this instrument 
 we are only one payment behind i argued with her it isnt right 
 me im a camp follower following this organizer from one mining camp to another montana colorado idaho but did he ever think to organize the women no wives dont count in the anglo locals either 
 aw cut it out ruth 
 look whos talking the great white father and worlds champion of womens rights 
 we cant think of them just as housewives but as allies and we have got to treat them as such 
 or why dont you just put a sign outside no dogs or women allowed 
 but honey 
 why didnt you support her you are the worst of the lot 
 maybe not but theres another thing like when you came in tonight i heard you ask your wife whos that his grandfather 
 you know i dont think that 
 well you are the organizer you work out strike strategy and most of the time you are dead right but when you figure everything the rankandfiles to do down to the last detail you dont give us anything to think about you afraid we are too lazy to take initiative 
 go on spill it 
 yeah lots of provocation lately they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge maybe they can bust the strike 
 hear those deputies slugged cente 
 okay so discrimination hurts the anglo too but it hurts me more and i have had enough of it 
 exactly and equalitys the one thing the bosses cant afford the biggest club they have over the anglo locals is well at least you get more than the mexicans 
 because most of us here are mexican americans because we want equality with anglo miners the same pay the same conditions 
 then whys the company hanging tough they have signed contracts with other locals why not this one 
 dont horse me price of zincs never been higher they dont want no strike not with their war boom on 
 are we talking to a union spokesman 
 its possible just negotiate 
 well if thats possible 
 too bad the men have always wanted to get a look at the president but you have come out here to settle the strike 
 no 
 new york you are not the company president by any chance 
 no new york 
 you mean delaware 
 thats all right its no secret my names hartwell im from the companys eastern office 
 you should have helped her without being asked 
 but you have got me doing everything mama never used to make me dry the 
 you have got to help around the house 
 but papa you need all the help you can get 
 dont i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school 
 the junior shop stewards theres lots of ways we can help 
 the what 
 papa cant i leave now theres a meeting of the junior shop stewards 
 i dont want you hanging around there hear 
 boy did you see the way mama whopped that deputy with her shoe knocked the gun right out 
 shes coming charley vidal gave her a lift 
 wheres your mama 
 papa we seen em two scabs over there 
 lus come down here 
 its mamas saints day 
 forgot what 
 i thought maybe you forgot 
 what are you doing here something wrong with mama 
 you think i was going to work you over i wouldnt dirty my hands with you 
 i know its wrong just let me go i will leave town just let me go 
 you think my kids have enough to eat you rat 
 my kids dont have enough to eat 
 t traidor a tu gente rompehuelga desgraciado 
 ramn listen my kids 
 you judas bloodsucker 
 ramn listen to me im in a jam i had to get a job 
 you you id expect it of an anglo yes but you 
 ramn listen for the love of god 
 maybe i think hes got a few things to learn about our people 
 sure but you want the truth you are even suspicious of him 
 hes a guest in my house isnt he 
 you lump them all together anglo workers and anglo bosses 
 what attitude 
 and another thing your attitude toward anglos if you are gonna be a leader 
 do the bosses wait no sanitation so my kids get sick does the company doctor wait twenty bucks so we miss one payment on the radio i bought for my wife does the company store wait pay or we take it away why they in such a hurry the bosses store they are trying to scare us thats why to make us afraid to move to hang on to what we got and like it well i dont like it im not scared and im fed up to here 
 but you dont pull a strike when the bosses want it so they can smash your union you wait till you are ready so you can win 
 i was talking to my wife 
 no i dont mind thats how come i told you about it 
 you mind 
 yeah first door on the right it aint that dirty just kinda filthy is all 
 you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road

 thats when he called me he told me his story and he pitched me a plan 
 i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for id have to set up a deal so sweet they wouldnt be able to walk away from it 
 how 
 its not too late to show her you are sorry 
 i dont buy that theres a place for hatred did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her do you know what that feels like 
 your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker 
 im genuinely happy that you found some peace nancy but you cant forgive for liz no one can and you cant forgive for me 
 i know its not my place to pass judgement on you but 
 maybe i am dealing with it 
 you have got to deal with this sooner or later tom you cant keep hiding 
 is that what you want me to do put it all on jesus let him sort it out in the afterlife 
 i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter i gave my grief to jesus christ

 thank you sir 
 good luck john 
 the numbers dont make sense sir his brothers are dead thats too bad but they are out of the equation sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away one private is simply not worth a squad colonel anderson this one is hes worth a lot more than that which is why im sending you you are the best field officer there is 
 alright i will give you that continue 
 respectfully sir sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private doesnt make a fucking goddamned bit of sense sir 
 spit it out captain 
 but sirii 
 hes the last of four brothers the other three were killed in action this is straight from the chief of staff 
 a private sir 
 theres a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundredand first near ramelle i want you to take a squad up there if hes alive bring him back to the beach for debarkation take whoever you need you have got your pick of the company 
 sir 
 im sending simpson to take over for you the division is going to caen you are not coming with us i have something else for you 
 pinned down a mile east of here waiting for some help from the navy guns

 resistance 
 sector four is secured we put out the last three german onefiftyfives found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc 
 report 
 alright let me know when 
 find a chaplain 
 shit that was no big deal 
 did you see what he did back there he stepped right into the open so i could get across 
 you take account of the wind 
 fortytwohundred i figure 
 that must be four thousand yards 
 not where i come from 
 you must be a hell a shot 
 yep 
 the army gave you that 
 thirtyoughtsix norton longbarrel with dualgroove parallel rifling elevated threeglass scope and a singlethrow hammer 
 what about the captain wheres he from 
 we got us a tent fortytwo feet across eighteen feet at center hundredandten foldin chairs circuits eleven towns covers all a hasset county and most a weller county i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin said ministry 
 so they travel around from place to place and preach 
 i dont make jokes about things of or related to the preaching of the holy gospel including the ministerial calling of my family 
 no kidding 
 in the back of a nineteen and thirty one stretch hudson with a big ole trailer 
 in west fork 
 im jackson im from west fork tennessee my pappys a preacher him and his two brothers got a ministry the blessed church of the wandering gospel 
 figured 
 as a matter of fact i am 
 you writin a book or somethin 
 so where are you from 
 i am but i like imported whiskey so there i am and i hear the biggest ole coon you ever did hear a rustlin right there in front of me that ole boy comes right out of the brush i got a clear shot and he knows hes bout to meet his maker i aim i got my finger tight on the trigger and then i just smile and say to that ole coon go on now you get out a here then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a that mash whiskey 
 jackson how many times i got to tell you you are from tennessee 
 me im walking with my hound lucy its about an hour fore sunrise and we are out huntin coon i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey 
 what deal 
 no kiddin 
 like hell you did 
 well i will be goddamned i knew it 
 nope he aint wade 
 he aint wade 
 i guess 
 he aint halfbad i guess 
 i mean ryan what do you think of him 
 i think im we got that eightyeight 
 what do you think 
 hell no 
 reiben are you makin fun a the way i talk 
 yall come back 
 of course sir 
 yes sir 
 capn 
 hes right we cant shoot himwell we could but wed get in an enormous amount of trouble and hes right about the bridge its a hell of a lot more important than he is 
 looks like a flaming asshole to me 
 so thats ryan 
 yep you step on a rusty nail get lockjaw never say another word as long as you live 
 you know what the best possible thing that could happen is 
 the hell he didnt 
 just shut up ryan didnt kill wade 
 you shut up this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of goddamned ryan fuck the little bastard 
 shut up will you 
 fuck private james ryan fuck him just fuck the goddamned sonofa bitch 
 wade sarge corporal insect all of us hell i will bet even the captain has a mother 
 last i knew 
 they got squirrels there too right 
 reiben how many time i got to tell you im from tennessee 
 you know what a bar weighs nineteen and a half pounds not counting ammo and you think these things are comfortable they may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each thats thirtysix pounds right there 
 army life is too dang easy my feet have gone soft back home we go out squirrel huntin i walk forever and a day and then some dont even raise a blister 
 if we find ryan and hes still alive that sonofabitch is gonna carry this goddamned bar back to the beach for me 
 hell no i think hes the best officer in the whole goddamned army bar none 
 you got somethin against the capn 
 no ones gonna win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian they assembled him at ocs out of spare body parts from dead gis i know this for a fact 
 hell no last time i shot a corporal capn miller near bit my head off 
 jackson 
 to each his own 
 its worth it 
 dont that get kind of expensive capn 
 you see i have got the best house in all of addley its not the biggest house but its got the best location right next to the junior high baseball field the garage windows face left field the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens twohundredtwenty two yards from home plate to my garage windows it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass i know we are one step closer to winning it all 
 say what capn 
 im in my backyard lying in my hammock with my arm around my wife listening for the sound of breaking glass 
 keep trying 
 not yet 
 good now get your goddamned gear 
 sir i understand i dont like it but i understand 
 you will grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve there is no wade there was one but he died a long time ago hes been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name you understand 
 sir i understand what you are doin but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner 
 whos wade 
 sir i aint feeling so chipper on account of wade 
 what the hells the matter with you jackson 
 gives wade the second shot 
 watching 
 they dont send planes to put out machine guns two flank runners with surpressing fire im going right whoever goes left has to be fast 
 we left them eightyeights 
 my guess too 
 in the shadow by those two trees 
 where 
 wade 
 yes sir it seems to me sir that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop smackdab in the middle of berlin germany now i aint one to question decisions made up on high sir but it seems to me that saving one private no matter how grievous the losses of his family is a waste of my godgiven talent 
 reiben i want you to listen closely to jackson this is the way to gripe jackson continue 
 seems to me capn this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources miller go on 
 id love to hear it 
 sir i have an opinion on this matter 
 i most likely would have sir had i been given the opportunity 
 you didnt volunteer jackson 
 captain my feet are most uncomfortable if id a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to ramelle i never would a volunteered for this here mission 
 no three brothers of his were killed in action command wants him out of there 
 senators son 
 a paratrooper named ryan hes going home if hes alive 
 thats general gavins his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it i will get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger i will get court marshaled if you were to take it theyd shoot me 
 how about that jeep 
 sorry sir division is using everything on wheels to get up to caen how come you guys arent going 
 a halftrack anything 
 no whitewalls sir theres a war on not there you goddamned idiot over there i cant help you sir 
 whitewalls 
 sorry sir fresh out of trucks how bout a N ford roadster hardtop red with black interior 
 i changed my mind 
 captain what about our deal 
 i teach english at addley high school in addley pennsylvania 
 whatd you say captain 
 thats better but you have still got a long way to go talk to reiben hes a natural and works at it he will give you some pointers 
 goddamn it sir 
 there you go again thats whining thats not okay 
 but sir 
 upham you have got to learn the difference between whining and griping you cant just rely on natural ability you have got to study and practice 
 the germans do 
 sure you got one 
 would they notice and eightyeight 
 those are tigers they have sixinch armor they dont even notice grenades 
 what about our grenades 
 those guns are close 
 i can tell what the gunners had for dinner 
 you dont count 
 id like to stay too captain 
 same place we are 
 i wonder where they are going 
 plenty 
 that only leaves three 
 what do they know i had nine but i feel through the ice when i was seven my brother pulled me out then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily it was a dud i figure one on the beaches one on the cliffs and two getting here 
 the men said nine 
 dont need it im a cat i have got five lives 
 good luck captain 
 a machine gun 
 what is it 
 thank him and tell him we are sorry about his loss 
 no but he heard firing just east less that a kilometer 
 did he see any sign of them 
 five nights ago he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg the leg got infected last night he went to ville cholet to get a doctor the doctor refused to come and when he got back this is what he found the krauts must have shown up while he was gone 
 i dont expect to live that long 
 if thats the way you feel why dont we wait until its up to a thousand 
 i will tell you what if im still alive when it hits fivehundred i will let you know and we will split the money 
 over threehundred 
 where are you from captain 
 some 
 you know classical music 
 it seemed appropriate 
 i heard 
 i have been humming it 
 yes do you know sibelius fourth symphony the normandy 
 it looks like a renoir 
 you think the rest of us were 
 i wasnt made for this 
 sarge 
 pass 
 upham 
 like i said it was nothing dont bunch up 
 but you could have gotten killed and i 
 it was nothing 
 sir im sorry about what happened i 
 dashes across the street 
 on the other side of the street crouches in a doorway with jackson upham is a bit in shock less from the nearness of the bullets than from what miller just did for him 
 glad of it 
 thats not all there were nine gunners on the eightyeights one had a broken heel on his boot two had bratwurst for supper last night one of them is named fritz the other hans maybe i dont know its hard to tell 
 you can tell all that just by the sound sire 
 forward forward now reverse 
 i know about bracketing i read about it the next one is going to land right on us 
 yes sir 
 reiben i dont know what id do without you sarge keep ryan close to you and alive 
 out of the mouth of babes 
 uh oh 
 we are going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else 
 what are we going to do 
 well if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo we might stand a chance but not against those tanks 
 what do you think 
 yes sir 
 sarge see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable 
 but thats my personal brand of stupidity i feel kind of proprietary about it if you do it again you are busted 
 you are welcome john 
 thanks for drawing that machine gun off me 
 i will do my best 
 dont let yourself get killed if you do they might make me give back the medal and then i wont be able to lip off to colonels anymore 
 i know 
 you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve you are the last one still alive 
 just what i want to do 
 no but if i get any worse you will have to relieve me 
 you want me to take over 
 i think you are right keith 
 john i have got to tell you i think you are about used up 
 thats the rub i liked wade whos ryan if they are both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other how do i choose look at my hand there it goes again 
 except this time the mission is a man 
 simple numbers every time you kill one of your men you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two three ten a hundred others we lost what thirtyone on the cliffs i will bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns thats over three hundred men maybe five hundred a thousand then thousand any number you want see its simple it lets you always choose mission over men 
 and how do you bluff yourself 
 not in so many words but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men dont have good morale its not worth a damn so if you are scared or empty or halfastep from a section eight do you tell your men of course not you bluff you lie 
 oh yeah 
 it could be worse you know the first thing they teach you at ocs lie to your men 
 no problem a pair of deuces less so what i bluff it used to tear me apart when id get one of my men killed but what was i supposed to do break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do of course not so i bluffed and after a while i started to fall for my own bluff it was great it made everything so much easier sarge is that why your hands been shaking 
 and what about your own hand 
 shes the best poker player you ever saw my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt finally my mother gave him an ultimatum either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down she never lost she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands and he bluffs he had sixteen levels of bullshit her eyes the tone of her voice her bets her jokes the way she sipped her coffee she was a master she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game every saturday night my father would lose two three hundred bucks and shed win it all back and then some and id stand there glued to her shoulder from the time i was five years old watching every hand every move studying how she did it thats why im such a good officer i can look at a mans face and tell you exactly what hes holding and if its a shit hand i know just what cards to deal him 
 bits and pieces 
 you know why im such a good officer because of my mother have i ever told you about her 
 yeah 
 yeah vecchio i couldnt remember his name he was a good kid remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze 
 vecchio 
 what was the name of that kid at anzio the one who got his face burned off 
 lets just find someplace 
 you alright 
 snatches the morphine from sarge quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot hes done this before 
 hesitates then drops his sulfa fumbles in his pack finds the morphine 
 more morphine hurry up come on come on 
 shoves the needle into wades neck thick vein pumps the morphine straight to wades brain motions impatiently to sarge 
 about to pour his sulfa sees the wound stops knows its fatal 
 pulls wades hands from the wound pours sulfa powder 
 rolls to his feet fire another burst kills the last of the german riflemen doesnt pause runs onto the field 
 hold your fire 
 how about you shut up and take your position 
 how about 
 how about you take your position 
 how about i go right sir 
 yeah what rule of thumb is that 
 i will be alright 
 you may have to find yourself a new line of work this one doesnt seem to agree with you anymore 
 no it comes and goes it stops when i look at it 
 is it getting worse 
 a couple of weeks it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading 
 it doesnt take this 
 makes you feel small doesnt it 
 yup hell of a mission 
 now you are the one kidding yourself hell of a mission 
 i hope this boy ryan is worth it 
 you never know 
 you are kidding yourself 
 if we stayed we could make a difference 
 three for three 
 command isnt going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell arent going to let them surrender 
 nope 
 they guys here arent going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up 
 and what about you 
 they are fine as long as they can gripe they will be alright 
 you think they will be alright 
 good news 
 nope 
 you got me afraid of bad news 
 since when have things been normal 
 its not normal not reading letters from home 
 maybe 
 you ever going to open those letters miller keeps his eyes on the maps 
 tell that to private james ryan we have got our orders lets go 
 hes right captain it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys 
 thats not what we are here for 
 got it sir we gonna go take care of those eightyeights 
 uh captain 
 push 
 uh captain 
 yep hell of a mission 
 hell of a mission 
 a fucking mess two maybe three kraut divisions no fronts no lines the drops were completely fouled up we have got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place trying to hang on command says we hold st mere but north of that its all krauts even if ryans where hes supposed to be hes more than likely dead 
 somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the hundredandfirsts radios the night before the drop not one of them works we are going in blind 
 we in radio contact with anybody up there 
 now we have got a straight shot due north to ramelle twentysix miles two villages between here and there st mere then bernay we will take the jeep as far as we can then go on on foot 
 i have got a line on one 
 you get a translator captain 
 twenty minutes ago miller damn i will go see if i can find another one you get reiben jackson and wade meet me at transport 
 what about talbot 
 fresh out 
 okay wade translators 
 beasleys dead 
 i want reiben on bar jackson with his sniper rifle beasley demolition 
 simpson jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick 
 simpson 
 what about the company 
 some private up there lost three brothers got a ticket home 
 you leading a squad 
 i wish you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission 
 caen 
 dont need to the krauts go that covered 
 you tryin to get yourself killed 
 worked didnt it 
 i thought you were my mother 
 captain if your mother saw you do that shed be very upset 
 rolls his eyes takes a breath scrambles into the gap the other five right behind 
 go 
 more tanks ryan lots of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation they know that they are dead men they settle into their positions and prepare to fire and die 
 goddamn it 
 knows what that means he hears the rumble of the tanks 
 continues firing cutting down the advancing germans 
 fires a burst more germans drop 
 fires a burst germans drops 
 here they come 
 hears the faint distant rumble of the tank barely has time to react sees 
 thats not where i am miller no where are you 
 i wonder if his cabin is still available 
 i coach the baseball team too 
 what deal 
 get back to your positions 
 goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it 
 opens up with the machine gun 
 here they come 
 cocks his thompson settles down behind some sandbags 
 see to it 
 leave him to me captain i will have him pissing and moaning with the best of us 
 lets hope because we are sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here 
 maybe caen 
 you are goddamned right i give the order vote jesus christ listen to me you little pissant pieces of shit i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes is that clear 
 yes sir of course sir i was merely speaking hypothetically if this was a voting situation then the vote would have been unanimous but of course its not a voting situation you are the captain and you give the orders sir 
 have it your way captain 
 you are only allowed to shoot at germans thats one of the rules 
 what if our guys open up sir 
 i have no fucking idea here we come cover me 
 on the bridge we are coming in 
 looks like they have been having a hell of a party here captain 
 looks like tea time maybe they are brits 
 scans the germans with his binoculars 
 thats a mystery to me 
 no sir 
 has anyone ever told you you are officer material 
 maybe but what if he dies on the way back you see what im saying sir the best possible situation is hes dead we find his body more or less intact we grab one of his dogtags and hightail it back to the beach or better yet we head over to caen and catch up with division 
 but we accomplish the mission 
 neither do i sir c and this is the worst one we find ryan and hes wounded not only does he not carry my gear we have to carry his gear and him 
 i dont like that one 
 b ryan is dead hes been blown up by the german equivalent of wade whose name i know you dont want me to mention theres nothing to find the biggest piece is the size of a pea we wander around looking for him until the germans pick us off one after another 
 except for the last part that ones not bad 
 well sir consider the possibilities a ryan is alive we have to take him back to the beach knowing you you dont let him carry my gear even though he really should and we all get killed trying to keep him alive 
 whys that 
 i have given this a lot of thought sir the best thing that could happen is we find ryan and hes dead 
 well now im saying we are moving out get off your ass 
 i thought you said we had an hour sir 
 up we are moving out 
 is silent motionless he gently closes wades eyes his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags he fumbles and drops it sarge notices 
 goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it 
 we cant leave it here 
 sir i have got an idea lets go around 
 i will make a note of your suggestions but i will leave that last one to you especially if hes already dead 
 yes sir as a final note id like to say fuck our orders fuck ramelle fuck the cheese capital of france and while we are at it fuck private james ryan 
 any further thoughts on the subject 
 but i am a captain if i were not a captain i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a topnotch poker player which i am having learned at the side of my mother who is by popular acclaim the best poker player in 
 sir if you were not a captain i would compliment you now for being an excellent liar 
 in addition as i pointed out earlier i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products when we arrive there to see if they live up to their excellent reputation moreover i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and im more than willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men especially you reiben to help relieve her suffering the men thoroughly enjoy the performance 
 im sorry sir i apologize but if you werent a captain or if i were a major what would you say 
 reiben whats the matter with you i dont gripe to you im a captain theres a chain of command griping goes one way up only up never down you gripe to me i gripe to my superior officers up get it i dont gripe to you i dont gripe in front of you how long you been in the army 
 you have orders too 
 well maybe not the captain but the rest of us have mothers 
 easy for you to say sir fucking james ryan id like to wring his fucking neck 
 reiben theres a fairly good chance you are not going to die at all 
 id much rather die in caen than ramelle sir its a personal thing 
 never mind dont worry we will pick up this kid hightail it back to division everything will work out fine 
 huh 
 ours is not to reason why 
 well sir in purely arithmetic terms since when does six equal one whats the sense in risking six guys to save one 
 sure what do you want to know 
 captain could you please explain the math of this mission to me 
 upham are you sure you have never been in combat 
 jesus christ hes a natural 
 stands on the edge of the woods almost in a trance 
 general gavin is going to be very irritated at you captain 
 well i for one like cheese 
 im listening sir 
 theres always a bright side 
 sir you know what ramelle is famous for cheese the rest of the company is going to caen and we are going to the goddamned cheese capital of france there is no bright side 
 theres to be a bright side look for it 
 i should be on my way to caen sir its like beethoven the guys one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf go figure i mean whod he piss off and here i am the beethoven of ladies foundation garments one step away from caen the center of the known lingerie universe and instead im going to ramelle to save some fucking private whos probably already dead 
 yeah how so 
 captain i gotta tell you the irony of this mission is fucking killing me 
 where are you planning on putting private ryan sir 
 sure reiben 
 captain can i ask you a question 
 but sir 
 trust me you are the best 
 no im not kaback is honest or what about faulkner or that little guy with the glasses 
 sorry i need a bar man you are the best 
 please sir you cant take me to ramelle i gotta go to caen sir please i told you they make caen lingerie there its beautiful its the best there is itsoh please sir 
 strides through the chaos avoiding the passing vehicles he sees his men and walks toward them reiben hurries up to miller pleading 
 stay at it until you get fire control keep em down wait for the navy 
 i dont think so captain 
 oh captain they will always make lingerie its one of the three basic needs of man food shelter silk teddies miller dream on private 
 theres a war on good chance they are not still making lingerie in caen 
 lingerie is my life sir my mothers got a shop in brooklyn i grew up in it from the time i could crawl we carry caen lingerie its the best there is its all i been thinking about since the invasion 
 reiben how the hell do you know so much about lingerie 
 just picture some french number been spending all day every day making creamcolored shearbody negligees with gentlelift silk cups and gathered empire waists what the hell you think she wears at night 
 so you ever heard of employee discounts my uncle sells shoes gets twentyfive percent off everything in the line got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen 
 dont worry we are the only rangers this side of the continent we have got to be first into caen 
 sir what if they send some other company into caen ahead of us while we are pinned down here 
 sure meet me at the top we will start the paperwork 
 captain can i put in for a transfer 
 sarge he was the best friend i ever had lemme tell you about sarge 
 and sarge 
 jackson was from west fork tennessee he was going to be a preacher his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson 
 yeah 
 upham good kid smart he was writing a book 
 upham and jackson what were they like 
 yes private 
 races through the debris trailed by bullets 
 fires the eightyeight 
 looks at miller sees him growing weak starting to sway he gently tries to move miller aside 
 doesnt move he just stares at sarges body 
 struggling with a pair of germans 
 is jumped on by one upham fires kills the german 
 yes sir 
 you set sarge nods 
 i wont need to sir its already here behind the barricade so 
 dont do that again 
 no private i want you to stay here keep your head down dont do anything brave or stupid 
 id like to go sir 
 alright come with me 
 yes sir 
 yeah yeah i want you right next to me no matter where i go you understand 
 thank you sir 
 i hear you sir but im not leaving 
 the hell you arent you are comin with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way you hear me private 
 this bridge cannot be held the germans have two companies less than three miles from here they have tanks 
 sir if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up our guys are going to be sitting ducks 
 private im sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isnt going to help 
 for you to blow up yeah yeah we heard that 
 hell i dont mind this mission sir as long as theres something up at ramelle for 
 we all have hes got nine lives or hes bulletproof or some damn thing 
 wades right its some kind of scientific magnetic thing i cant explain it but i have seen it 
 look at upham you dont hear him complaining 
 you want unpleasant just wait i can do much better than this 
 reiben you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes 
 fine you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear 
 as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted my grandfather got old as grandfathers tend to do he needed someone to take care of him we move around all the time going from one mine to another so we had to put him in a home nice enough place but kind of depressing but not for granddad he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship going to tahiti he had his own cabin first class with room service it just so happened that the weather was always lousy so he never bothered to go up on deck happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died 
 oh christ now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again 
 no i just happen to take the captains advice and look at the bright side of things 
 thats because as i have pointed out on numerous occasions you are a happy idiot 
 so what i have got three satchel charges six gammon grenades a dozen andahalf pineapples and all my regular gear you dont hear me complaining 
 hey i got a mother jackson you got a mother 
 jesus reiben think of the poor bastards mother 
 captain hes fast 
 damn fool sir 
 what are we likely to run into 
 i usually like surprises 
 yeah so 
 lingerie 
 frogs 
 i care dont you know what caens famous for sarge 
 who cares 
 out of the frying pan into the fucking latrine 
 fertilizer captain i think we are in a cranberry bog 
 shit sir 
 what about you captain 
 i dont know i kind of like wades idea about the cruise ship i have never been to tahiti 
 freaked out trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter cant 
 goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it 
 on guard glancing back pissed off 
 hes fast captain i saw him 
 sir i ran the N in high school 
 somebody must know where hes from what he did for a living 
 we know 
 but everybodys heard of him he won the congressional medal of honor he saved a dozen men 
 get lost 
 so where are you from 
 shit thats nothing i ran twenty two flat 
 twentyfourfive 
 how fast 
 who knows it worked 
 you think he really believed it 
 its easy it runs in my family take my grandfather for example 
 how do you do it 
 since i was nine years old they got a lot of explosives around mines me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw damn we had fun 
 demolition right 
 we have records we have proof im sorry to be the one to have to tell you this but its going to get worse now if i were you i would take that fellowship 
 no no hes not 
 because hes guilty 
 how can you how can you say that 
 dont let your fathers business infect your life 
 you are trying to get me to say something thats why you are telling me all of this 
 well take a look around the house is everything nice but not too nice are there lots of uh rugs pieces of art stereo equipment uh furniture a lot of things bought with cash does he give a lot of gifts do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousanddollar range 
 whats the profile 
 look why dont you check it out for yourself see if your father fits the profile 
 pardon me 
 we believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings phoney patients we have been investigating him for five years we believe that when they die he takes their money 
 im supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that i worked for my entire life i dont even care i met this boy over the summer and i i cant see him because of this i cant talk to him i cant talk to my father about i wore these clothes i thought i thought that if i looked right and if i acted right then someone would talk to me but i look awful and i feel awful could you could you please talk to me be a little decent 
 taking care of people isnt a growth enterprise mr sims i hope you write that down in your report id like your bosses to read it

 oh yeah there was uh somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio and uh we got this telephone call this guy is making a sound effects record and hed gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream 
 so anyway these two federal marshals meet the plane and they take our address and they ask us never to fly with friendly skies again 
 okay i give up 
 which they did let me finish 
 and then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around 
 so anyway they closed the doors and she starts to scream i have never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that

 dad im so glad i went goodnight 
 morning honey

 how do you do 
 are you kidding i never miss a party police chief rasch my wife emilie 
 oskar good of you to come 
 did i threaten anybody here i stated a simple fact 
 he doesnt deserve your loyalty more important hes not worth you making threats against us 
 hes got no style we all know that so we should hang him for it 
 hes a friend of yours you want to help him out tell me this though has he ever once shown you his appreciation i have yet to see it never a courtesy never a thank you note he forgets my wife at christmas time 
 so i will talk to him about it 
 the place produces nothing i shouldnt say that nothing it produces reaches the army thats not all right 
 done lets not talk about it anymore lets have a good time 
 thatd be fine 
 whoever they are the ones theyd appreciate some kind of gesture from me 
 what others 
 no look its the others they are the ones causing these delays 
 id never ask you for money you know that i dont even like talking about it money favors i find it very awkward it makes me very uncomfortable 
 you did so much 
 i didnt do enough 
 there will be generations because of what you did 
 if id made more money i threw away so much money you have no idea if id just 
 oskar there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you look at them 
 i could have got more if id just i dont know if id just i could have got more 
 no no what what is it 
 i will talk to you later 
 you will lose money 
 you dont i do i see a difference 
 i know what you are saying but i dont see the difference 
 no 
 theres a rumor you have been going around miscalibrating the machines i dont think thats a good idea 
 well sure so would i so would you i wouldnt worry about it we will get it right one of these days 
 they are withholding payment 
 well thats to be expected they have to understand these are startup problems this isnt pots and pans this is a precise business i will write them a letter 
 they arrived can you believe it 
 they arrived 
 stern 
 we need to talk 
 yes 
 thats very generous of you 
 give or take what stern how many count them 
 eight hundred give or take 
 more 
 four hundred four fifty 
 well i will talk to somebody i will take care of it 
 i think its too late 
 i will talk to him 
 theres nothing you can do im not asking you to do anything you came into my office 
 i will admit its a weakness i dont think he enjoys it all right he does enjoy it so what what do you expect me to do about it 
 and killing 
 you have to understand goeths under enormous pressure you have to think of it in his situation hes got this whole place to run hes responsible for everything that goes on here all these people hes got a lot of things to worry about and hes got the war which brings out the worst in people never the good always the bad always the bad but in normal circumstances he wouldnt be like this hed be all right thered be just the good aspects of him which is a wonderful crook a guy who loves good food good wine the ladies making money 
 its dangerous its dangerous to me personally 
 what other point is 
 no im not losing money thats not the point 
 are you losing money 
 you think i dont know what you are doing you are so quiet all the time i know 
 oskar 
 i got to go i will see you 
 thank you 
 this i dont know maybe you can trade it for something 
 ah yes 
 christmas presents 
 you try to be fair to people they walk out the door i have never understood that whats next 
 do what 
 dont ever do that to me again 
 theres a machinist outside whod like to thank you personally for giving him a job 
 what 
 the war could end 
 any reason to think next month will be worse 
 yes 
 better this month than last 
 yes 
 i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while its till hot we are doing well 
 but its less its less than what i would pay a pole thats the point im trying to make poles cost more 
 the jewish workers salary you pay it directly to the ss not to the worker he gets nothing 
 what was that about the ss the rate the 
 they should be 
 i dont know anybody whod be interested in that 
 something they can hold in their hands 
 pots and pans 
 well they wouldnt own it id own it id pay them back in product they can trade it on the black market do whatever they want everybodys happy 
 jews can no longer own businesses sir thats why this ones for sale 
 jews yeah investors 
 the contracts thats the easy part finding the money to buy the company thats hard 
 get the contracts and im sure you will do very well in fact the worse things get the better you will do it was a pleasure 
 i think most people right now have other priorities 
 once the war ends forget it but for now its great you could make a fortune dont you think 
 simple engineering though wouldnt you think change the machines around whatever you do you could make other things couldnt you 
 i was just the accountant 
 of course hes stealing from me we are in business together what is this im sitting here suddenly everybodys talking like this is something bad we take from each other we take from the army everybody uses everybody it works out everybodys happy 
 hes stealing from you oskar 
 theres taking money and theres taking money you know that hes taking money 
 whats he done thats so bad take money thats a crime come on what are we here for to fight a war we are here to make money all of us 
 he was a metal press operator quite skilled 
 a onearmed machinist oskar 
 no 
 would it do any good 
 file a grievance with the economic office its your right 
 i lost a day of production i lost a worker i expect to be compensated 
 its got nothing to do with reality oskar i know it and you know it its a matter of national priority to these guys its got a ritual significance to them jews shoveling snow

 poor cotton could life be a little more cruel 
 good question you took the bait

 thats quick 
 no this is a set up 
 go on untie him 
 then i will make this easy for you i like you im crazy about you sid but im gonna stay away until you say otherwise 
 its not you derek i dont trust myself i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men 
 i dont really know what happened in woodsboro sid but i know you dont trust me 
 no its not 
 i had the four oclock shift you werent there you had us worried is everything okay 
 its under control 
 what about your film isnt it due next week have you even started it

 im sorry honey i got behind 
 where have you been you missed my shining moment i won the macaroni sundae binge

 wait a sec derek we forgot to flip 
 just for you sid 
 we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings 
 or it found us 
 so we found a compromise 
 and we didnt want to do that sid we wanted to give you your moneys worth 
 so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience 
 yeah we really had our work cut out for us it really is the curse of the sequel the billy or stu things been done 
 a twist ending if you will 
 hope youre ready sid we got one last surprise for you 
 and now drum roll please

 a verdict and premiere all on the same day i love it 
 the way i see it well be arrested go to prison cash in on the home footage secure a book deal if all goes as planned our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii 
 of course not who wants to whats the point if we dont get caught wheres the glamour in that 
 until now 
 youre the one who got away 
 youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there its a whole world sid youre really popular amongst the demented 
 we have our own website now we dedicated a whole page to you 
 i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly hook line 
 he sent me the cutest email 
 i find his work overwrought 
 he hates oliver stone 
 i really dont like that comparison honey 
 ever see natural born killers well derek and i have this whole mickey or mallorywoody harrelson or juliette lewis thing going on 
 yeah how can we help do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life 
 yeah you look quizzical yet pensive

 he seemed harmless 
 randy somebody 
 what guy 
 shes got guards with her 
 i didnt say she was alone that guy from her home town showed up they went off together 
 you werent supposed to leave her alone 
 damned if i know she ditched me 
 wheres sid

 theres nothing im coming down 
 dewey 
 no wait here 
 lets go 
 he filmed his victims 
 jesus christ 
 cmon lets go 
 maybe they never got here he could have taken her anywhere 
 over here 
 this is all too familiar 
 lets find out 
 ssshh what was that 
 hallie 
 shit its both of them the first murders were to throw us using the same names as woodsboro but they have moved on they are getting closer to sidney they are not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill they are looking for the new tatum 
 the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision 
 and joels premed 
 they are roomates 
 wed break some furniture 
 and as lonely as i am 
 maybe not but think about the sex as frustrated as i am 
 dewey you and i would never make it 
 and its sexier in the dark 
 thats not the way its done 
 can we turn the light on 
 a bloody knife a ghost mask something like that 
 what are we looking for 
 you broke my heart 
 billy had alibis too 
 solid alibis he was with sidney when she was attacked 
 hes already gotta be a part of sids life what do you know about this derek 
 meaning 
 if you were truly a copycat wouldnt you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could 
 not good 
 not good how you doin 
 i also know that you are an aging tv reporter slash writer who despite huge tabloid success has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a nonpositive manner a coupla failed relationships withim guessing balding older menhave turned you into this bitch with a cell phone but i bet sometimes late at night when you are all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled 
 yeah 
 i know that 
 and deep down im a good person make no mistake dewey im a shit 
 i think you are all an act 
 you are a hard one to figure out gale its that complex yet shallow quality its deliberate 
 mood swing im manic depressive 
 so what made you change your mind about sidney 
 no im the one whos sorry i misjudged you now if you will excuse me i have some oozing to do 
 im sorry i dont know what else to say except im sorry 
 how do you know my dimwitted inexperience isnt merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower peoples expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation 
 i never meant to imply 
 page N deputy dewey oozed with inexperience 
 you have every right to be upset 
 no what you are is a money hungry fame seeking liar andforgive me for saying mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be 
 oh dewey im sorry 
 page N deputy dewey filled the room with his dimwitted barney fifish presence i think you have explained yourself 
 and an explanation is of course out of the question 
 yes i do retain reading skills shock 
 i see you read the book

 i think you got the wrong number buddy 
 i dont know 
 well what number are you trying to reach 
 who is this 
 who is this 
 hello 
 jesus hello 
 horror flicks bmovies from miltons heyday 
 what are these movies amazombies space psychos creatures from thesan andreas fault 
 well you will find neither rina reynolds however you will 
 it may be maureen reynolds 
 i know every face in here respect for the unknown actor i suppose myself included if you are looking for maureen prescott 
 well if you wont work for me will you work for the president 
 listen im busy nobody has access to those files except studio execs can you please go away now 
 well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you 
 nope 
 does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you 
 i dont watch tv and i hate books whatta you need 
 im gale weathers author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders and anchorwoman for total entertainment maybe you have heard of me 
 can i help you 
 alright calm down im going to radio in for backup right now 
 he killed milton the killers inside there oh god dewey deweys in there too he needs medical help hes hurt 
 jesus gale what happened 
 wrong this issue is sidney prescott and either mr riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her so where is she 
 boys boys why dont we compare our gun calibers later the issue is maureen prescott 
 actually there was more this time this time we found a picture too 
 ok look we all know that this has something to do with stab N what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott 
 ben damon christine perkins sarah darling tom prinze thats four last time i learned how to count 
 four there are five 
 yeah but if im not mistaken you said in your book that sidney got it wrong before she accused cotton weary of murdering her mother and he was sent away for it maybe there is a third killer sidney might know something 
 but we know who killed maureen prescott billy loomis and stu macher i mean they even told sidney how they did it 
 whoever it is now is taking credit for maureen prescotts murder 
 deal but im still detective kincaidok 
 please call me gale 
 in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i have never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers 
 but you wont you are a good man detective we think alike i know you need my help and i know you know i need your help 
 im not at liberty to tell you that miss weathers you are no longer working with the lapd i dont even know why you are standing in here right now by all means i should have you thrown out 
 who 
 yes well we have a suspect so dont get that worried 
 shit sarah darling i interviewed her too god its happening again isnt it detective 
 thats stab N miss weathers it looks like we are going to be getting a warrant to speak with miss prescott anyway 
 look miss weathers if theres a problem give me a call heres my card im always there 
 oh i thought you wanted me to stick around 
 i go to the police station and do my job and you go back to being gale weathers 
 alright kincaid no where to 
 and who would that be 
 id love to help really i wouldnt mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath but i honestly dont know where sidney is after windsor she dropped off the face of the earth the only other person that might know is not going to talk 
 i have tried to get in touch with sidney prescott but shes keeping herself very well hidden you are my one and only hope in finding her her life may be in grave danger 
 theres more 
 thats sidney prescotts mother 
 a note 
 i wish that was all miss weathers but theres more the killer left a note 
 so is that why you are here is that why you are holding me from my show to tell me about some brutal homicide im not even involved in 
 both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films 
 well i interviewed damon once for the show he was a real obnoxious fuck any way the second one christine perkins she had a part in stab N didnt she she was playing cici 
 im sorry miss weathers allow me to introduce myself mark kincaid lapd are you familiar with the actor ben damon or the actress christine perkins 
 jesus christ you scared the shit out of me 
 catch him or kill him 
 oh yeah how 
 because that means that we are dealing with an ordinary flesh and blood killer and i know how to handle guys like that 
 how is that good news 
 heres the deal im off to search the soundstage thats good news 
 i used to think i had the perfect mom perfect family till i found out i was wrong she had a secret life and i tried to understand that and soon as i thought i had more secrets i dont know who my mom was sometimes i feel like im just learning about my mother for the first time you know with tv and those movies and what not god sometimes i feel like im just learning about myself for the first time like im watching my life instead of living in it 
 what did you know about your mother 
 hmm 
 cant arrest ghosts but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people you are here you are not hiding you have done the right thing miss prescott 
 ghosts are tough you cant shoot ghosts 
 i know what its like to see ghosts that dont go away to be watching a scary movie in your head whether you want to or not watching it alone 
 what do you mean 
 im a homicide detective remember when you see what i see day in and day out the violence that people do to each other you get haunted i think you know about that 
 excuse me 
 to me hollywood is about death 
 must be exciting beautiful place beautiful people 
 no they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business i grew up here and i know my way around the studios 
 did you request this case 
 all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one all bets are off 
 i will call you mark when you catch the killer detective 
 call me mark would you cause im gonna keep calling you sidney 
 you seem to like movies detective 
 you mean like movie trilogies 
 what do you know about trilogies 
 absolutely 
 are you sure 
 why didnt you tell me this is my mother dewey why didnt you say something 
 the killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder sidney recently hes also left a photo of your mother 
 sid get in my car you are coming back to the station with me where its safe 
 and what made you think it was sidney 
 jesus christ sidney what happened i got a call on my cell from home they told me that someone was attacked 
 no 
 he could have monitored the calls on a scanner did you call her from the set 
 sidney do you have any idea how he could have gotten your number 
 what when 
 the killer called her 
 nice to finally meet you sidney 
 theres someone here who wants to help 
 what rielly 
 detective kincaid 
 is that a threat 
 when its a threat you will know it 
 is that a threat detective 
 well sids dad couldnt help you and he was married to maureen 
 who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter 
 what does this have to do with sid 
 before you jump to conclusions the man in the picture cotton weary is out of the country on business his alibi checks out seems hes got a tv show in australia N per cent cotton its supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious but thats besides the point 
 police are still searching through the debris could be days before we find her that is if shes even there 
 what about angelina tyler she was there too 
 that is for me to decide i need to talk to her mr riley she is a key element in this case i have a press conference in an hour and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities 
 i told you i dont know where sidney is and even if there was a third killer sidney doesnt know about it 
 understood if you will excuse me detective gale 
 thats fine mr rielly but if anyone else should die im going to have to get a warrant 
 yeah a real tragedy 
 mr rielly my name is mark kincaid im with the lapd are you aware of last nights events 
 he wasnt superhuman dewey he wasnt superhuman at all 
 watch out sid randy said the killers always superhuman 
 dewey its gale 
 dont worry sid id never leave you like that 
 dewey my god i thought you were dead 
 sid i want you to stay here i will be right back im not gonna let them get gale

 nevermind whatd you two find 
 sidney what happened

 do you have her number stored in your memory phone memory 
 sid this is detective kincaid 
 thank you

 gale your engines still running 
 neither are you magnum pi 
 you are not a detective 
 i happen to work for the police god dammit 
 stop following me 
 im on duty 
 jennifer wait where are you going off to 
 jennifer needs me 
 and who is that 
 i have got my suspicions but still nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person 
 right sorry do you think he did it 
 what part of off the record dont you understand 
 im sorry this is too good 
 i already removed it i think someone on the film was trying to find sid and thats the only reason i came here to make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything 
 someone stole sids file 
 the boys said no she wouldnt give her name a month later the station gets broken into the file room ransacked 
 and 
 two months ago the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with stab N she wanted to see the file on sid for research 
 always 
 off the record 
 all of what dewey you do know something dont you 
 brace yourself gale all of this is actually not about you 
 dewey you are not just here because of that second rate kmart straighttovideo version of me are you 
 you used to say that was our strength 
 it didnt work dewey we tried we are different 
 whats wrong with just being gale weathers i liked her 
 it was fucking N minutes ii i couldnt say no i could have been the next diane sawyer 
 so its off to london for a week new york for a month la forever 
 you said youd never leave woodsboro the only place thats real but now you are here not with me dewey i took care of you i waited until you were well i couldnt stay there i mean its like dog years one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else 
 what about me 
 again i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders what about you 
 why would the police come to you 
 yes look lets get something straight dewey i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me not cause im out to make the sunrise studios slashings 
 do you really mean it this time gale 
 this has everything to do with me dewey i was the one who brought the nations attention to this shit anyway i will be damned if im gonna sit around and pass on the buck again 
 you mean our past as in me and sid this has nothing to do with you gale 
 uhhuh another news clipping another one about sids mom dewey whether we like it or not it looks like we are going to have to go back into our past 
 they found another note 
 show him 
 what so you can just exploit her again with another book sid doesnt need you gale 
 dewey personal lives and pasts aside this is about sidney we need to know where she is 
 when we did the first stab i realized id known maureen prescott before i mean as rina i couldnt tell anyone can you imagine the press 
 but you know who she was 
 what the hell are you guys getting at i make horror films thats what i do the studio came to me with stab they came to me check it out 
 i remember her she was a bit player in a couple of my movies a nobody so what does it matter 
 no point im just gonna give detective kincaid a call 
 whats your point 
 just what the hell do you people think you are doing barging in here like this i have got important calls to make i run this studio 
 so you knew sidney prescotts mother 
 sure 
 would you excuse me for a moment 
 well if you were in my shoes dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis youd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick 
 your life 
 honestly my life 
 roman from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way honestly though tell us whats your favorite scary movie 
 well its a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy have no fear roman is here aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe we are going to pull off one of the best stabs yet 
 its a pleasure to finally meet you roman 
 good morning gale pleasure to be here 
 do you get any of my witty humor i mean you did play me for three movies his two hands dingus 
 rob reiner and quentin tarentino 
 miltons not a killer hes a pervert he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack off parties he has with his two best friends 
 i think miltons the killer i think he just went out to kill another cast member 
 settle down beavis why dont you tell us the truth 
 oh come on you have made millions off the story of her murder you are obsessed with her and you are obsessed with her daughter 
 good twist 
 nobody said she was an actor 
 bitch 
 oh i wish i got that one on tape itd put a smile on my face everytime im down 
 look whos talking moneybags you got more homes than i do 
 really you know youd make a fascinating interview lifestyles of the rich and psychotic 
 basements creep me out 
 gale weathers would find a way 
 possibly 
 there a story in that building 
 no really 
 need to get in that building 
 ha maybe i should join snl 
 thats funny 
 and as a sane person for you that must be quite a stretch 
 you know in the movies i play you as being much smarter 
 none 
 heres how i see it i have got no house no movie no gun and im being stalked because someone wants to kill me no because someone wants to kill you so now starting now i go where you go that way if someone wants to kill me i will be with you and since they really want to kill you they wont kill me they will kill you make sense 
 i am gale weathers 
 being gale weathers what the hell are you doing 
 what the hell are you doing 
 geez 
 no hes not dead hes still breathing look 
 god damn it you two run hurry hes dead 
 i dunno but i can tell you that yours will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass now come out and fight like a real man you pussy 
 whats your favorite scary movie gale 
 listen you sick bastard what the fuck do you want 
 oh shit its my cell 
 whos phone 
 i dont know screw them look whats important is that we stick together no matter what if anyone is next its you or me jen 
 shit where the hell are tom and angelina 
 still that was a much better movie i saw it at the premiere last week god what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for we have gotta get down to business 
 i know right it was kinda weak thats cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it the script was written by some new guy he wrote arlington street 
 and i die naked ugh this is complete bullshit who wrote this piece of crap 
 wait a second whoa calm down number one there were five different versions of the script given out ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script and what i die in stab N 
 god damn you gale weathers dont you see the killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script ben damons character was the first one to get offed so was his girlfriend but she wasnt cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed then sarah darlings candy and now me 
 dewey what the hell is she rambling about now whats wrong jen see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting 
 you how can i ever get any fame playing you 
 im saying things got out of hand maybe they did take advantage of her maybe the sad truth is this is not the city for innocence no charges were brought and the bottom line is rina reynolds wouldnt play by the rules you wanna get ahead in hollywood you gotta play the game or go home 
 are you saying she was 
 it was in the N s everything was different i was well known for my parties rina knew what they were it was for girls like her to meet men men who could get them parts if they made the right impression nothing happened to her that she didnt invite in one way or another no matter what she said afterwards 
 well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv why dont you start talking 
 now you listen to me lois lane let it go its dead and buried daddy took ol yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago 
 i dont think so just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood 
 yeah 
 just because you knew her 
 get real that would make me a suspect 
 and now i mean murders on your set and still you say nothing 
 who 
 answer the question you knew sidneys mom 
 they are the ones who approved it 
 listen lois lane i love your show and all but last month i happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because im a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls it was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superiors attentions 
 oh come on why the hostility 
 well then i guess i will be leaving then 
 gale weathers what are you doing here no press on the set no press no press on set get that woman out of here 
 excuse me detective i think we have some business to attend to 
 you mean whats left of us yeah im running on empty anyways gotta refuel 
 i think we should go inside i have to have a talk with the cast all of you 
 really cause that stunt lost me the lead role in roman polanskis latest picture huh what a coincide i was picked up by roman bridger well not exactly the roman i wanted get my point stab N is bullshit fuck because of your big mouth im here drinking piss water scotch with second rate fucking celebrities like jennifer jollie and yourself hey i just got an idea maybe i should have a look at your break line that your car over there 
 heh well thats tv journalism for ya stage the news to boost ratings 
 hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs and how i faked the tire blowout just so my insurance wouldnt sky rocket 
 tom prinze tanked as usual thats a shocker 
 gale weathers what a surprise 
 gale watchout 
 lets get out of here 
 i know 
 i know he killed kincaid 
 gale hes got dewey 
 what are you talking about 
 we did some researching in the archives sid something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mothers murder for two years of her life N up until N she basically disappeared off the face of the earth 
 whos this 
 oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me what are you doing here 
 oh you know the usual small talk whats new how ya been how do you want to die 
 whatd he say 
 hi gale im glad you are all right 
 oh my god sidney you ran fast or what hey 
 roman knock it off do you people even know why you kill people you kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason 
 see sid now comes the part where we get away with it the part where we win cause face it sidney in this world the bad guys win 
 i cant take it anymore this hollywood exploitation of the nightmare i lived has to be stopped i did this to make you all repent for your sins and now im pleased i have got my message across goodbye

 heh so you think sidney so you think its all been building up to this sid every stab every scream every ounce of blood thats been spilled has all been leading up to this moment welcome tothe final act 
 no you didnt kill my mother billy loomis and stu macher did 
 let them try you will never find me i have already gotten away with murder before for instance maureen prescott 
 you sick fuck im tracing this call as we speak the police are gonna nail your ass 
 i want to finish what i started i want to finish the game 
 wwhat do you want 
 do you think its over sidney do you 
 its mother sidney now be a good girl and turn on the news do it 
 who the fuck is this 
 dont you want to know how you can help sidney are you listening to me huh 
 im sorry your voice 
 no i need to call you just you 
 well then the people you need to call are the police 
 uhhuh im sure i have killed someone oh my god i have actually killed someone 
 are you sure 
 laura i think i just killed somebody 
 yes hi im laura im a trained counselor how can i help you 
 hello 
 i cant im bad off billy you cut too deep 
 find her you dipshit 
 where the fuck did she go 
 i dont know billy but im hurtin 
 odds are she will miss anyway 
 she cant get both of us 
 she looked dead still does 
 i thought she was dead 
 no its not 
 its on the table 
 get the gun i will untie pops 
 thats it billy i cant take any more im feeling woozy 
 everyone dies but us we get to carry on and plan the sequel lets face it these days you gotta have a sequel 
 and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head its a perfect ending 
 except for me and billy we were left for dead 
 what if your father snapped your moms anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree killing everyone 
 yeah 
 ready 
 you know what time it is sid its after midnight its your mothers anniversary we killed her exactly one year ago today 
 this is the best part sid billys got it all figured out why do you think we kept your father alive so long why did we save you for last 
 thats right and now that you are no longer a virgin you gotta die those are the rules 
 think about it on the off chance i get caught a motive like that could divide a jury for years dont you think you took my mother so i took yours big sympathy factor maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior it certainly fucked you up it made you have sex with a psychopath 
 and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people dont think so you see its scarier when theres no motive sid 
 nope 
 yeah we just watched a few movies took a few notes it was fun 
 tell that to cotton weary you wouldnt believe how easy it was to frame him 
 and if you get it right you die 
 its an easy game we ask you a question if you get it wrong you die 
 you have to play sid dont want to disappoint your dad hes been waiting around all night 
 oh yeah 
 where ya going its not over yet we have got one more surprise stu i believe its your turn 
 i was hoping sid and i could talk 
 dude what are you doing here 
 you know it

 oh 
 because im trying to build your selfesteem you are far too sensitive 
 i was just asking why are you always at me

 stop it 
 jesus fuck that hurt 
 we did your mom a favor sid the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something 
 i dont understand 
 why why did you hear that stu i think she wants a motive hmmm i dont really believe in motives sid i mean did norman bates have a motive 
 why did you kill my mother 
 we already played that game you lost remember 
 fuck you 
 its called guess how im going to die 
 its okay give me the gun 
 no dont believe him 
 im alright gotta get help 
 i thought you were 
 no but if it were you that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track using your one phone call to call me so i wouldnt think it was you 
 you dont still think it was me 
 uhhuh 
 yeah and when i called no one answered 
 no sheriff burke called your dad i saw him 
 i called my dad 
 when you are arrested you are allowed one phone call who did you call

 ssshh everythings gonna be okay i promise 
 i wanna let go i do 
 sure it is sid its all a movie lifes one great big movie only you cant pick your genre 
 but this is life this isnt a movie 
 sure it does its like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father 
 everytime i get close to you i see my mom i know it doesnt make sense 
 oh sidney 
 i think in some weird analytical psychological bullshit way im scared im gonna turn out just like her you know like the bad seed or something 
 but you are right enough is enough i cant wallow in the grief process forever and i cant keep lying to myself about who my mom was 
 you lost your mom 
 no billy im the one whos been selfish and selfabsorbed with all of my post traumatic stress 
 so im sorry i have been a selfish shit and im sorry 
 so 
 its okay we need to talk 
 subtlety stu look it up 
 you have to move on sid 
 your parents split up its not the same thing your mom left town shes not in a coffin somewhere

 that fish smelled strong 
 as long as it records i dont give a shit we are not doing a remote 
 about thirty seconds 
 whats the delay 
 the control boards glitched you know we cant carry a live picture 
 prep the compact we will hide it in a window and tape all of tonights festivities 
 whats the plan 
 not this time i owe cotton that much hell even i thought that man was guilty 
 but its so much easier when we make it up 
 if im gonna blow this up i need hard proof 
 when did that ever stop you you cant sit on this this is huge 
 no not so fast we have nothing concrete 
 you want to go live 
 jesus christ an innocent man on death row a killer still on the loose kenny tell me im dreaming 
 jesus the camerahurry 
 what what 
 but couldnt it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat the same person who planted it in cottons car framing him the same person who really killed your mother 
 i saw him leaving wearing it 
 he was drunk that night he left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him 
 hes lying she wouldnt have touched him he raped her then butchered her her blood was all over his coat 
 not one word he admits to having sex with your mother but thats all 
 has his story changed 
 many times 
 have you talked to cotton 
 i think you falsely identified him yes 
 during the trial you did all those stories about me you called me a liar 
 he was convicted in a court of law your testimony put him away it doesnt matter what i think 
 do you still think hes innocent 
 what is your problem you got what you wanted cotton weary is in jail they are gonna gas him a book is not gonna change that 
 and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories 
 your mothers murder was last years hottest court case somebody was gonna write a book about it 
 you owe my mother 
 i owe you shit 
 please you owe me 
 forget it 
 off the record no cameras 
 kenny camera now 
 i want to talk to you 
 just stay back 
 im not here to fight 
 i will send you a copy 
 i will look for it 
 it will be out later this year 
 hows the book 
 yes thats right 
 its okay tatum shes just doing her job right gale 
 ricki lake 
 where do you get this shit 
 and it fucked her up royally think about it it makes perfect sense her moms death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world shes disillusioned wheres god etc completely suicidal and one day she snaps she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression 
 cut some slack she watched her mom get butchered 
 please its common knowledge her mother was a trollop 
 you are evil 
 maybe shes a slut just like her mom 
 why would sidney want to be with steve she has her own bubblebutt boyfriend billy 
 maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage 
 and why would she do that 
 what if she did it what if sidney killed casey and steve 
 for attention the girl has some serious issues 
 why would she lie about it 
 she was never attacked i think she made it all up 
 who are you 
 looks like you fingered the wrong guy again 
 leavemealone 
 poor billyboyfriend an innocent guy doesnt stand a chance with you 
 hello sidney 
 hello 
 if you hang up you will die just like your mother 
 good try randy tell tatum to hurry bye now 
 what am i doing 
 uhhuh 
 can you see me right now 
 right here 
 so where are you 
 thats the original part 
 why would you call me from my front porch 
 your front porch 
 so where are you 
 the question is not who am i the question is where am i 
 so who are you 
 maybe thats because im not randy 
 that is so unoriginal you disappoint me randy 
 are you alone in the house 
 because they are all the same its always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who cant act who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door they are ridiculous 
 and why is that 
 dont start you know i dont watch that shit 
 whats your favorite scary movie 
 i like that thing you are doing with your voice randy its sexy 
 do you like scary movies sidney 
 aha randy you gave yourself away are you calling from work tatums on her way over 
 scary night isnt it with the murders and all its like right out of a horror movie or something 
 i have no idea 
 sleep tight sweetie 
 have a good trip 
 got it 
 so call if you need me 
 out at the airport 
 no oh well im hitting the sack my flight leaves first thing in the morning now the expo runs all weekend so i wont be back til sunday theres cash on the table and i will be staying at the raleigh hilton 
 no you didnt 
 i heard screaming 
 can you knock 
 are you okay 
 twice 
 i thought blockbuster fired you 
 working thank you 
 fuck you nut case where were you last night 
 oooooh before or after he sliced and diced 
 stu was with me last night 
 you got it 
 only if its a nice meg ryan movie 
 listen to me sid i found tatum shes dead shes been killed i think stu did it 
 dont come any closer 
 dont shoot its me 
 stop right there 
 shes the scream queen 
 the fog terror train prom night how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies 
 no sid 
 come on sid give me the gun 
 dont listen to him its him hes the one 
 his movie nut mind has snapped sid hes gone psycho 
 i will be right back 
 yeah 
 wanna another beer 
 there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie for instance N you can never have sex the minute you get a little nookie you are as good as gone sex always equals death N never drink or do drugs the sin factor its an extension of number one and N never ever ever under any circumstances say i will be right back 
 not until trading places in N jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies she didnt show her tits until she went legit 
 i wanna see jamie lees breasts when do we see jamie lees breasts 
 like you had one 
 there goes my chance with sid 
 he came to make up 
 whats leatherface doing here 
 i can cry on cue 
 we could be like two grief stricken students and we will say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly 
 i had em hid in the foreign section 
 i thought everything was checked out 
 its N motives are incidental 
 and what would be your motive 
 you are absolutely right im the first to admit it if this were a scary movie id be the prime suspect 
 so while they are off investigating a dead end billy whos been written off as a suspect is busy planning his next hunting expedition 
 which is you 
 because hes probably dead his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere eyes gauged see the police are always off track with this shit if theyd watch prom night theyd save time theres formula to it a very simple one everyones always a suspect the father the principal the town derelict 
 i think her father did it how come they cant find his ass 
 could be now that billys tried to mutilate her you think sid would go out with me 
 shes saving herself for you 
 maybe sidney wouldnt have sex with him 
 so whats his reason 
 theres always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend thats the beauty of it all simplicity besides if its too complicated you lose your target audience 
 why would he want to kill his own girlfriend 
 because obviously they dont watch enough movies this is standard horror movie stuff prom night revisited 
 the whyd the police let him go 
 you are such a little lap dog hes got killer printed all over his forehead 
 it was all a misunderstanding he didnt do anything 
 if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section 
 what 
 yeah im off early curfew you know now thats poor taste 
 you coming tonight 
 we had a run in the mass murder section 
 jesus this place is packed 
 did you really put her liver in the mailbox i hear they found her liver in the mailbox 
 im gonna gut your ass in a second 
 besides takes a man to do something like that 
 it would certainly improve your high school q 
 what are you saying that i killed her or something 
 and are the police aware you dated the victim 
 before she dumped him for steve 
 for about two seconds 
 yeah casey and steve were completely hollowed out takes a man to do something like that 
 that was an ice pick not exactly the same 
 peer pressure im way to sensitive 
 so stu whats your motive billys got one the police are on their way what are you going to tell them 
 you will never get away with this 
 the official term is psychotic 
 you are crazy both of you 
 its all part of the game 
 why are you doing this 
 guess i wont be needing this anymore 
 you guys can go up to my parents room to talk and whatever 
 if tatum sees you she will draw blood 
 cool see you guys tonight bring food 
 yeah okay whatever 
 remember theres safety in numbers 
 my parents are out of town it will be like my hurricane bash last year nothing extreme just a few of us hangin 
 are you serious 
 and to celebrate this impromptu fall break i propose we have a party tonight my house 
 are you kidding this is like christmas 
 why are they doing this 
 hey stu didnt you use to date casey 
 you heard billy shut the fuck up 
 deal 
 theres that sense of humor i knew it still existed ohh sid lets have some fun tonight 
 oh sidney what a guy can talk tits til hes dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie watch out 
 tatum 
 watch the show sid his basket is bigger than the one you are pushing 
 what secret meaning like a satanical thing 
 grant wrote the song himself im convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning eight is enough 
 no way 
 during foreplay i sing the theme song to myself eight is enough to fill our lives with love its a real turn on 
 how does that get you in the mood with stu 
 grant goodeve the oldest brother on eight is enough remember that show he was the one who lived off alone he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing eight is enough to fill our lives with love he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge god i was in love with grant he was so hot the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman 
 who 
 with stu theres little time to stop and reflect but sometimes before to relax and get in the mood i think about grant goodeve 
 what do you think about when you are having sex 
 billy and his penis dont deserve you 
 but hes been so patient with me tatum you know with all the sex stuff how many guys would put up with a girlfriend whos sexually anorexic 
 you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mothers untimely death its no big deal you will thaw out 
 billys right whenever he touches me i just cant relax 
 he better not be i told stu to keep his mouth shut i think we can live without everybodys all american for one night 
 is billy going to be there tonight 
 oh god 
 hey sid just think if they make a movie about you whos gonna play you 
 come on lets rock 
 you are right im cracking up ignore me 
 dont go there sid you are starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick dont freak yourself out we have got a long night ahead of us 
 if i was wrong cotton then hes still out there 
 well you can only hear that richard geregerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it 
 and you believe it 
 it goes further back sid theres been talk about other men 
 created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers 
 you cant prove a rumor thats why its a rumor 
 if they were having an affair how come that cotton couldnt prove it in court 
 i didnt say that sid but you know there were rumors your dad was always out of town on business maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman 
 so you think my mom was a slut too 
 maybe cotton weary is telling the truth maybe he was having an affair with your mom 
 come on pathos has its perks 
 i dont know 
 this could be good what do you think sid 
 it was him tatum i know it 
 it was just some sick fuck having a laugh 
 just ignore him you had good reason to think what you did 
 i bet hes pissed 
 shit what is he doing here 
 i want you to meet me here right after class okay 
 this is a mistake i shouldnt be here 
 but if it wasnt billy it could be anybody he could be here at school right now 
 just relax you are at school now no one can get you here 
 just a sec i need to talk to someone 
 come on sid 
 its alright i will get it 
 take a message 
 i knew this guy was too perfect he was destined to have a flaw 
 he was there tatum 
 do you really think billy did it 
 no nothings like it used to be 
 just like old times aint it 
 just another sleepover at the rileys 
 her dads out of town shes staying with us 
 its okay she was supposed to pick me up 
 bye 
 whatever just hurry 
 good cause i wanna swing by blockbuster and get us a video i was thinkin tom cruise in all the right moves you know if you pause it just right you can see his penis

 he wouldnt just turn himself in it doesnt make any sense 
 you dont it goes to court now 
 so far its all dead ends no credit history no employment history his bank accounts only five years old and it started as cash we are even trying to trace his furniture but for now all we know is hes independently wealth well educated and totally insane we may never know how he got that way 
 what about the trace on his bank account and the guns there must be something to connect him with a past 
 he cuts off the skin if his fingertips thats why we cant find a single usable print in the apartment hes been doing it for quite a while keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back 
 go start picking up the pieces we will shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner

 i have no understanding of this place anymore 
 i heard 
 did you read in the paper today about the man who was walking his dog he was attacked and his wallet and his watch were taken and then while he was still lying unconscious his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes it happened four blocks from here 
 you know

 i thought you might want to be filled in 
 its none of my business anymore 
 greed it was written in blood 
 already 
 there was a second 
 no i havent heard

 everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible also this shouldnt be his first assignment 
 you have left unfinished business before 
 i know what you are thinking okay you dont want to get in bed with this every night but its different now you are retiring in six days you are all the way gone 
 this cant be my last duty here it will go on and on 
 whats this im declining this case it dont work that way 
 one is gluttony 
 hey so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins but this was a fat guy the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him and writing on the walls happens all the time its like the fashionable thing to do 
 envy sloth pride and lust seven 
 so what this victim 
 there are seven deadly sins gluttony wrath greed 
 announcing what 
 dear detectives long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light its the murderers way of announcing himself 
 he had a gun he had a gun and he made it happen he made me do it he made me put that that thing on oh christ he made me wear it and and he told me to fuck her he had the gun in my mouth 
 who tied her down you or him 
 she was she was on the bed she was just sitting on the bed 
 where was the prostitute where was she 
 what what 
 where was the girl 
 and and and he said he asked me if i was married and i could see he had a gun in his hand 
 okay 
 put it down put it on the ground 
 this guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here he wanted it here at exactly seven oclock 
 im im just delivering a package 
 who are you what are you doing out here 
 what the hells going on 
 turn around hands on your head 
 jesus christ man dont shoot me 
 no 
 you didnt know 
 her pretty head 
 give me the gun 
 i visited your home this morning after you left 
 david please 
 its surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct 
 why 
 what time is it 
 its not too far away now 
 whats so exciting 
 it doesnt matter who i am who i am means absolutely nothing you need to turn left here at the traffic light 
 i mean at this point what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself 
 what do you mean 
 hello 
 i dont believe it 
 because i envy your normal life envy is my sin 
 somerset 
 i want you to know i wish i could have lived like you do 
 what the fuck is going on 
 here he comes 
 shut up 
 you have made a good life for yourself 
 what the fuck is going on here 
 i wish i could have been a normal man like you i wish i could have a simple life 
 its close 
 just keep leading the way 
 sit back 
 and i remember breaking your nose you are only alive because i didnt kill you 
 i seem to remember knocking on your door 
 tell me what it was that gave me away what was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before i walked up to you and put my hands in the air 
 really just biding your time then toying with me is that it letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in 
 we would have gotten you eventually 
 you are going to be remembered and its all because of me and the only reason im here right now is because i wanted to be 
 and why is that 
 you should be thanking me 
 delusions of grandeur 
 a woman so ugly on the inside that she couldnt bare to go on living if she couldnt be beautiful on the outside a drug dealer a drug dealing pederast actually and dont forget the disease spreading whore only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face thats the point you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner and in every home literally and we tolerate it because its common it seems trivial and we tolerate all day long morning noon and night not anymore im setting the example and its going to be puzzled over and studied and followed from now on 
 murderers like you 
 a woman 
 murderers 
 innocent is that supposed to be funny look at the people i killed an obese man a disgusting man who could barely stand up who if you saw him on the street youd point so your friends could mock him along with you who if you saw him while you were eating you wouldnt be able to finish your meal after him i picked the lawyer and you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets 
 you only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off thats all 
 you wouldnt because you know there are consequences its in those eyes of yours though nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work i wont deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner i only took their sins to logical conclusions 
 now i wouldnt do something like that johnny i like you i like you a lot 
 i i doubt i enjoyed it any more than detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows isnt that true how happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity 
 oh dont worry you wont 
 well i will be standing beside you the whole time so you be sure to let me know when this whole complete reality thing is done wouldnt want to miss it 
 i cant wait for you to see i cant wait its really going to be something 
 its going to be flawless people will barely be able to comprehend it it will seem almost surreal but it will have a tangible reality so they wont be able to deny it 
 spit it out 
 you cant see the whole the whole complete act yet not yet but when this is done its going to be so so 
 in two months no ones going to even remember this happened 
 you know thats not true 
 i hate to burst your bubble but other than the fact that you are especially sadistic theres nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours 
 not me im not special im not exceptional this is though what im doing 
 what makes you so special that people should pay attention 
 wanting people to pay attention you cant just tap them on the shoulder you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer then you have their strict attention 
 we are not just going to pick up two more bodies are we johnny that wouldnt be shocking enough wouldnt keep you on the front page of the newspapers 
 you will see 
 where we headed 
 put the gun down somerset 
 dont do this please 
 put your gun down 
 i cant let you do this 
 tell me its not true 
 what did you say 
 throw your weapon detective now 
 what are you talking about what happened 
 throw your gun down now 
 theres no time to discuss it 
 wait 
 stay with him 
 give me a break 
 kiss me on the lips 
 slut 
 well i have to tell you i think i have fallen in love with you 
 what is it 
 i will 
 if john does head splits open and a ufo flies out i want you to have expected it 
 i can tell you this i recognize his lawyer his names mark swarr 
 no 
 hes only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece right can you even conceive of whats going to happen next i mean can you even imagine how he will try to finish it 
 well what the fuck man 
 you and i are probably for the first time ever in total agreement he wouldnt just stop 
 you know hes fucking us 
 when do we get to question him 
 because he is john doe by choice 
 big surprise 
 as soon as this is over im gone 
 no actually i wasnt sure at all 
 you knew id say yes 
 im requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days youd be doing me the favor 
 you think you are doing me a big favor by staying 
 one of two things will happen we are either going to get john doe or he will finish his series of seven and this case will go on for years 
 oh you want to stay now 
 call for help and you will live but you will be disfigured or put yourself out of your misery 
 he cut her up and dressed the wounds 
 that part of me is dead 
 listen to yourself you say the problem with people is they dont care so i dont care about people but you are already here you have been here a long time so theres a part of you that knows even if everything you say is true none of it matters 
 no im not im talking about common everyday life here if you let yourself worry about one thing you will worry about the next and the next and it never ends in this place ignorance isnt just bliss its a matter of survival 
 you are talking about people who are mentally ill you are 
 wrong i sympathize completely because if you cant win then if you dont ignore everything and everyone around you you you become like john doe its easier to beat a child than it is to raise it because it takes so much work to love you just have to make sure you dont stop to think about the abuse and the damage because you will risk being sad keep ignoring 
 oh you are so much better than everyone right no ones worthy of you 
 it wasnt one thing if thats what you mean i just i cant live here anymore i cant live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue 
 what the fuck is wrong with you what burnt you out 
 people dont want a champion they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers 
 you think you are preparing me for the hard times ahead you think you are toughening me up well you are not you are quitting fine but im staying 
 why dont you shut the fuck up for a while you bitch and complain if i thought like you i would have slit my wrist already 
 just know that in this case theres not going to be any satisfaction if we caught john doe and he were the devil himself if it turned out he were actually satan then that might live up to our expectations no human being could do these things right but this is not the devil its just a man 
 you follow the law and do the best you can its all there 
 wheres the victory 
 you do your job 
 you tell me then you walk into an apartment and a man has beaten his wife to death or the wife murdered the husband and you have to wash the blood off their children you put the killer in jail who won 
 you are the oldest man i know somerset 
 dont try to focus on things as black and white because you will go blind theres no winning and losing here 
 how can you say that especially after today 
 no face it now stop thinking its good guys against bad guys 
 if we get him i will be happy enough 
 you know theres not going to be a happy ending to this its not possible anymore 
 one birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book the century of the detective by jurgen thorwald it traced the history of deduction as a science and it sealed my fate because it was real not fiction and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime it was incredible to me 
 sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps 
 the irony is after a day of the type of work he did hed come home and read me these morbid crime stories murders in the rue morgue le fanus green tea my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours 
 these murders are his masterwork his sermon to all of us to all us sinners 
 hes preaching 
 looking around i have got a bad feeling these murders are his lifes work 
 no dates indicated placed on the shelves in no discernible order its just his mind poured out on paper i dont think its going to give us any specifics 
 what sick ridiculous puppets we are and what a gross little stage we dance on what fun we have dancing and fucking not a care in the world not knowing that we are nothing we are not what was intended 
 then he must write about these murders 
 well there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room and near as i can tell each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages 
 im trying alright just tell me what we have got 
 we could use about fifty more men here 
 we had him 
 what are you talking about 
 no point in arguing anymore 
 you stupid son of a 
 okay okay get off 
 think it through if we leave a hole like this we will never prosecute he will walk we have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door 
 by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead 
 think about how we got here 
 what the fuck is wrong with you 
 think about it 
 we have probable cause now 
 we need a warrant 
 the hell i cant we get in there and we can stop him 
 you cant go in there 
 it was him 
 wait just wait 
 what happened 
 im fine 
 are you alright 
 who told you about my silver tongue you been talking to my wife 
 you do the talking put that old silver tongue of yours to work 
 what are you going to say 
 sure uh excuse me are you by any chance a serial killer oh you are well come with us then if its okay 
 we will take a look at him talk to him 
 this is stupid itd be just too easy 
 thats what it says jonathan doe 
 you are sure you are reading that right john doe 
 saint thomas aquinas he wrote about the seven deadly sins 
 the writings of saint thomas aqu aquin 
 that is 
 the marquis de sade and origins of sadism 
 its not what you think it is 
 modern homicide investigation in cold blood of human bondage human bondage 
 the divine comedy a history of catholicism a book called murderers and madmen 
 i know i know focusing on one little thing 
 we are focusing 
 this is a waste of time 
 i dont neither do you 
 how do you know all about this 
 yeah well at least we are out of the office we have got pizza 
 yeah some college student whos taking english N and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime 
 if you want to know whos been reading paradise lost purgatory and say the life and time of charlie manson the bureaus computer will tell you it might give us a name 
 so they ran our list 
 legal illegal these terms dont apply i dont applaud it 
 how is this legal 
 flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable communism to violent crime 
 you got to be kidding 
 they monitor reading habits not every book but certain ones are flagged books about lets say how to build a nuclear bomb or maybe mein kampf whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the fbi from then on 
 what assessing fines 
 for a long time the fbis been hooked into the library system keeping accurate records 
 him 
 its probably nothing but even if it is its no skin off our teeth the man at hot dog world is a friend in the bureau 
 its be best if you got to the point cause im about ready to punch you in the face 
 by telling you this im trusting you more than i trust most people 
 lets go 
 well that was money well spent 
 i dont know like fifty 
 how much money do you have 
 what does all that matter anyway its not our job to figure him out is it all we have to do is catching him 
 just realize this is not some common lunatic the type of intestinal fortitude it must take to keep a man bound for a full year to connect tubes to his genitals to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints hes methodical and exacting and worst of all hes patient 
 just because the bastard has a library card it doesnt make him einstein 
 well hes been right so far hasnt he 
 and so what 
 this quote his first words to us i looked it up its from miltons paradise lost long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light 
 yes we do here 
 we dont know for sure 
 no hes not depending on luck you have seen that we walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied victor to the bed to the day to the day because he wanted us to 
 sooner or later his lucks goning to run out 
 no 
 hey freud what brand of bullshit are you shoveling huh right now hes probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommys panties singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter 
 its a fine line between insane and inspired 
 oh blah blah blah the guys insane 
 its too dismissive to call him a lunatic we cant make that mistake 
 there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow i mean christ do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves 
 this is the job its not an easter egg hunt 
 im sick of sitting around waiting for him to kill again 
 who pays the rent on time 
 a landlords dream tenant a paralyzed man with no tongue 
 victors landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month he says quote i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment threeoone and nobody ever complained about him hes the best tenant i have ever had 
 oh its alright 
 sorry about that i just 
 they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well 
 how do those cockroaches get here so quick 
 he will string us along all the way if we are not careful 
 i dont know about you but i feed off my emotions 
 we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here no matter how hard it is we have to stay focused on the details 
 no kidding no fucking kidding 
 listen to me hes all about playing games 
 i want him bad i dont just want to catch him anymore i want to hurt him 
 the way this has gone till now i wouldnt have thought it was possible but we may have underestimated this guy 
 call an ambulance 
 it is victor 
 sounds like he knew what he was talking about 
 i think hemingway wrote somewhere i cant remember where but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this you have to have the ability to kill i think he meant you truly must be able to do it not just faking it too survive 
 i expected it to be bad you know i took a human life but i slept like a baby that night i never gave it a second thought 
 how was it 
 i got him i got the sonofabitch see i was doing really good up till then lots of street busts i have always had this weird luck everything always went my way but this was wild i got him with one shot right between the eyes next thing i know the mayors pinning a medal on me picture in the paper whole nine yards 
 how did the fire fight end 
 it was my first one of these we were a secondary unit and i was pretty shaky going in i was still considered a rookie 
 and 
 never took a bullet i pulled my gun once fired it once 
 never in my twentyfour years knock on wood i have only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it never fired it though not once you 
 satisfy our curiosity 
 why would we 
 we will tag along 
 yes they were there so it must be 
 the fingerprints 
 he doesnt have the desire somehow our killer seems to have more purpose more purpose than victor could ever conceive of 
 you tell me im new in town 
 doesnt seem like our man does it 
 does this make it with you 
 in this city if all the skeletons came out of all the closets if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again thered be no more room for the living 
 i have seen the same im not the country hick you seem to think i am 
 im sorry but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues i have seen so many corpses rolled away unrevenged 
 bullshit 
 we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away on the slim chance its ever needed in a courtroom its like collecting diamonds on a desert island you keep them just in case you ever get rescued but its a pretty big ocean out there 
 oh thats all 
 all we do is pick up the pieces we take all the evidence and all the pictures and samples we write everything down and note what time things happened 
 then you tell me what you think we are doing 
 i wish i still thought like you 
 and you dont 
 you meant what you said to mrs gould didnt you about catching this guy you really want to believe that dont you 
 who the hell knows theres plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they dont want to do you know little voices tell them bad things 
 it doesnt fit he doesnt want us to help him stop 
 he just may be nuts enough 
 no 
 just honestly have you ever seen anything like this been involved in anything like this 
 just wait 
 oh yeah sure you got to be kidding 
 bear with me 
 what 
 we are screwed hes fucking with us 
 there must be something 
 a switchblade 
 what the fuck is that 
 its got to be 
 nothing 
 even if they did those photos were taken before forensics 
 you are sure your men didnt move this 
 okay but what 
 what if its not that shes seen something what if shes supposed to see something but she just hasnt been given a chance to see it yet 
 i know 
 this is the one thing 
 none which i dont understand he had to get back out 
 no witnesses of any kind 
 totally unrelated victims 
 nothing 
 no fingerprints 
 like because someones holding a gun on you 
 attrition when you regret your sins but not because you love god 
 forced what 
 for now lets just consider the books as the murderers inspiration the books and sermons are about atonement for sin and these murders have been like forced attrition 
 right but there pride comes first not gluttony the sins are in a different order 
 seven terraces of purgation 
 yeah parts of them anyway in purgatory dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain seeing all these other guys who sinned 
 did you read them 
 like in the parsons tale and dante 
 the sins were used in medieval sermons there were seven cardinal virtues and then seven deadly sins created as a learning tool because they distract from true worship 
 punishing 
 hes preaching 
 we put her in a safe house 
 and if its a threat 
 goulds wife she was away on business if this means she saw anything i dont know what we have questioned her at least five times 
 this is just to satisfy my curiosity im still leaving town saturday 
 look i appreciate being able to talk this out but uh 
 he must have left another puzzle piece 
 he cut along the side of his stomach the love handle 
 all day saturday and all day sunday the murderer would want gould to take his time to have to sit there and decide where do you make the first cut theres a gun in your face but what part of your body is expendable 
 the leather chair was soaked through with sweat 
 well his body was found monday night okay but get this the office was closed all day monday which means as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend our killer could have gotten in here on friday he could have spent all day saturday with gould and all day sunday 
 im certain he was the biggest defense lawyer around infamous actually 
 our guy got into office probably before the building closed and security tightened up gould must have been working late 
 i vaguely recall a large angry man and someone called norton 
 you have never seen the odd couple this is sick the honeymooners 
 i just have to say i cant respect any man whos never seen green acres 
 i read remember reading 
 you go to movies at least 
 what about them 
 what about sports 
 all television does is teach children that its really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day 
 hello 
 id like you to meet somerset 
 tonight 
 hows that 
 im invited to have a late supper at your house and i accept 
 well 
 what 
 its my wife 
 detective mills here honey i asked you not to call me here i will call you back what why 
 its a package deal you get the phone with the office 
 can we talk about this in private 
 its too soon for him 
 whoa whoa what 
 im declining this case i want us reassigned 
 this is a premeditated puzzle and its only the beginning 
 this is his stuff i have been out in the cold all day 
 this was one sadistic motherfucker 
 he ate his fill and was forced to continue eating till his body rejected the food the killer held a bucket under him and then kept serving he took his time the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours the victims throat was swollen from the effort and there was probably a point where he passed out thats when killer kicked him in the stomach popped him 
 but why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing it must have been intentional 
 it could be nothing 
 you always have to find one singular thing to focus on theres always one thing and it may be as small as a speck of dust but you find it and focus till its an exhausted possibility 
 this doesnt make any sense 
 have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink near the food 
 same color and texture 
 i just dont think we should have that sort of relationship wed start quarreling over insignificant things 
 okay sure its just that with my old partner you know 
 is that clear 
 yeah well all i want is just just dont be jerking me off thats all i ask dont jerk me off 
 i made a decision because i have to consider the integrity of the scene i cant worry whether you think you are getting enough time on the playing field 
 the badge in my pocket says detective same as yours 
 good 
 anyway i did my time on doortodoors and walking a beat i did all that shit for a long time 
 no 
 you have seen my files right seen the things i have done 
 guessing at this point is useless 
 you think it was poison 
 i dont know feel free to look for yourself okay 
 is there any blood in it 
 its a bucket of vomit 
 theres a bucket under the table 
 what 
 theres a bucket here 
 please be quiet for a while would you 
 when we found him he was lying there with a knife in his back so what else could it be but homicide except i finally figured out he held the knife behind him put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall then he shoved his body backwards 
 then why are we wasting our time this guys hearts got to be roughly the size of a canned ham if this isnt a coronary i dont know what is 
 no one yet 
 who said this was murder 
 for now 
 drop it 
 and i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a dead man who wasnt really dead until davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut 
 i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into 
 well over the next seven days do me the favor of remembering it 
 i realize that 
 not here 
 i wasnt standing around guarding the local taco bell i have worked homicide for five and a half years 
 let me tell you how i want this to go i want you to look and i want you to listen 
 maybe i thought i could do more good here than there i dont know look itd be great by me if we didnt start right off kicking each other in the balls but you are calling the shots lieutenant so however you want it to go 
 its very simple you worked a nice quiet town but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it i have just never seen it done that way before detective 
 maybe im not understanding the question 
 you just met me 
 im here for the same reasons as you i guess or at least the same reasons you used to have for being here before before you decided to quit 
 all this effort you have made to get transferred its the first question that pops into my head 
 i i dont follow 
 i meant to ask you something mills when we spoke on the phone i cant help wondering why here 
 i need to start getting the feel of it all right meet the people 
 actually if its all the same id like to get to the precinct house asap seeing how we dont have much time for this whole transition thing 
 since we are just starting out i thought we could go to a bar sit and talk for awhile after that we will 
 im a little thrown i just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here 
 why is this painting hanging upsidedown 
 what 
 this painting 
 i cant do this now please 
 are you absolutely certain 
 i dont see anything 
 anything anything missing or different 
 please i need you to help me if we are going to get who did this 
 i dont know why why now 
 i need you to look at each one carefully very carefully look for anything that seems strange or out of place anything at all 
 i i dont understand 
 im sorry about this mrs gould i really am 
 i can tell you now i know im positive i made the right decision im positive but theres never a day that passes that i dont wish i had decided differently 
 i want to have children its just 
 well i got up one morning and went to work just like any other day except it was my first since hearing about the baby and i i felt this fear and anxiety washing over me i looked around and i thought how can we raise a child surrounded by all this how can a child grow up here so that night i told her i didnt want us to have it and over the next few weeks i convinced her it was wrong i mean i wore her down slowly 
 i hate this city 
 oh tracy i have to tell you im not the one to talk to about this 
 i dont know 
 you should look into private schools 
 i have been going to some of the schools looking for work but the conditions here are horrible 
 he mentioned it 
 i cant be a burden especially now i know i will get used to things i guess i wanted to know what someone whos lived here thinks upstate it was a completely different environment i dont know if david told you but i teach fifth grade or did 
 talk to him about it he will understand if you tell him how you feel 
 i dont know why i asked you to come 
 you have to put blinders on sometimes most times 
 perfect example 
 im sorry i only 
 i feel strange being here with you without david knowing 
 i dont sleep very well 
 its a hard place 
 i mean you known this city you have been here for so long 
 if you can please call me please i have to go now goodnight 
 i dont know with this case 
 too long what do you think so far 
 how long have you lived here 
 any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable just ask your husband 
 it surprises me it really does 
 i was close once it just didnt happen 
 i guess i wont be showing it to him then 
 you have a strange way about you i mean interesting im sorry its really none of my business its just nice to meet a man who talks like that if david saw that paper hed say you are a fag thats how he is 
 no matter how often i see guns i still cant get used to them 
 dont worry i dont wear it at the dinner table 
 really 
 high school and college yes pretty hokey huh i knew on our first date this was the man i was going to marry god he was the funniest man id ever met 
 i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts

 you will have to wait until we reach the agencyfall in behind the column 
 where 
 we got two around that age 
 shed be about thirteen now 
 you dont remember 
 for gods sake what happened to me 
 i wouldnt have made it by myself 
 how did you get me out of there 
 i have a yearning for smog cars and many many people a real dirty big city what do you think 
 what 
 so hes dictating you a new bestseller whatever that is its not our son 
 you know tommi wants me to become the man i used to be 
 your book thats why you were always in the cellar 
 its important he knows the last chapter 
 he whom do you mean 
 i told you there is no way out he wont let you go 
 we loved each other once have you forgotten that 
 oh ellen my sweet ellen of course i knew 
 what are you talking about 
 of course you will give me the blame again like back then just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today isnt that right ellen 
 martin damnit what are you up to let go of me 
 you know what i have to do now and believe me i dont enjoy doing this 
 its simply too dangerous here but no you always have to have it your way 
 martin what 
 damn it look at you dont you see whats happening with you we need to get out of here dont you understand out of this house 
 will you finally cut it out just in case you havent noticed i am trying to write a book here and maybe even with your birdbrains you can figure its a pretty tough job so why cant you just leave me alone 
 okay so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors there is something negative about the place what the hell are you trying to say come on spit it out 
 this house the whole damned area around here is one mass grave now you might call me crazy but there is something negative about the place 
 during the middle ages people were executed at every corner whats your point 
 hi darling 
 let me guess another short circuit 
 an animal what kind of animal a goddamned trex or what 
 maybe an animal 
 old come look at this she has wounds wounds on her head like thrashes or bites 
 she was old 
 look at this the dog shes dead 
 what 
 i havent the slightest idea 
 whos that 
 the house tommi something just doesnt jive here 
 what what am i supposed to sense 
 its just a feeling dont you sense it too 
 ellen what are you trying to prove anyway that we have created ourselves a ghost come on 
 events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals 
 in the village look what i found 
 where have you been 
 oh baloney you should just hear yourself talk 
 but thats not the point what if all these things are somehow connected 
 i went to see prof roth you know i had another one of those dreams last night i saw tommi 
 where have you been all day 
 why not she can guard the house by the way i gave her a name clara 
 dont tell me you have made friends with that wandering flea circus 
 no thanks i have everything i need drive safely you hear 
 hey you are still here i suppose you like it here with us 
 yeah i have to go to town 
 so did you sleep good 
 come on at least try one it took me two hours to make these 
 now what did i do to deserve this 
 come on this isnt about honesty you just need a good nights sleep the way you toss and turn all night even i hardly get any sleep 
 well apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you dont you remember what we promised to each other honesty trust 
 you know its not always easy for me either but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis 
 martin its not funny 
 someone from the village 
 who was that 
 if we stand a chance at all its only by sticking together 
 maybe different i dont know ellen 
 do you really think anything can ever be like it was before 
 so do i believe me 
 i miss tommi so much 
 and two months later we got married and all because of one sentence with you my life began and with you shall it end 
 i was so excited about meeting you again and again i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you 
 not a book fair i was signing autographs in a department store 
 cherryred tears your first book i read it at least nine times and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair 
 what 
 cherryred tears 
 we just have to make a new beginning 
 i have a funny feeling do you think we will get over all thats happened 
 hey take your time you know time heals better than any shrink ever can 
 maybe i should talk to dr roth about it 
 i just had a really strange experience 
 is everything alright arent you feeling well 
 making our very own solstice fire 
 what are you doing 
 well if you wont let me smoke grass then at least i will go get myself some cigarettes 
 where are you going 
 yes daddy 
 hey flower child the sixties are over and this stuff is hazardous to your health 
 my father was a pilot and do i know how to fly 
 my father was an electrician already forgot that 
 you 
 i will do it myself 
 do you have a better idea 
 are you crazy that costs a fortune 
 we will call for someone from town first thing in the morning 
 look at this we will have to fix the whole wiring this stuff is dangerous as hell 
 in the cellar i think wait i will take care of it 
 do you know where fuse box is 
 oh damnit 
 hey the fuse 
 we are probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity damned box 
 maybe the antennas broken 
 oh that was upstairs a real antiquity i think its great 
 i mean the armchair 
 it still worked in town 
 what kind of a horrible thing is that 
 well then i guess id better leave the two of you alone but dont forget 
 oh the muse we are still having our differences you know how it is with women 
 me and the muse of course how is your book coming along 
 they say its fantastic at least thats what i read in a mens magazine so who are the two lucky ones 
 so how does it feel to be kissed by two women 
 you will never get away from me 
 stop that 
 oh god tommi 
 ellen move aside 
 what else should i do damn it hes dying 
 you are not a doctor you will hurt him 
 i have to cut his windpipe 
 with you my life began and with you shall it end 
 say it anyway come on how much do you love me 
 come on say it you know 
 why else 
 i dont know all about what happened back then but it always stood between me and my husband 
 but what is the truth 
 thats alright dont misunderstand my husband its only that hes already had enough problems with this case and who would believe him if he told the truth 
 thank you elisabeth i didnt mean to 
 frank kosinski heres the address go see him ask him 
 oh no no you are not bothering him he has lots of time since hes been retired 
 i really hate to bother him but 
 thank you 
 oh ellen i have been wondering when youd come why dont you step in 
 you are doing fine arent you i mean the two of you alone in that house so far out in the moor 
 ellen 
 i appreciate your concern but we live in that house i need to know what happened in there 
 do yourself a favor dont ask 
 N what happened back then 
 you know after doing that job for so many years you learn to appreciate the simple things in life flowers incorporate a beauty that i always missed in life but certainly you are not here to chat about my hobbies 
 wait wont you join me for a cup of coffee 
 i guess its too lonely for most folks its time for me to get going its been a pleasure meeting you 
 village gossip you are a real attraction here 
 do i look like it that much 
 its a pleasure you are from the city right 
 ellen straub 
 you know i saw him sitting outside your gate oh im sorry im forgetting my manners again i havent even introduced myself yet hi my names lindner karl lindner 
 no i have never seen him before 
 does this dog here belong to you 
 hello can i help you 
 we can do all of that later but first you need to calm down 
 it all went so fast he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver i only wanted to defend myself you have to call the police 
 i think i have killed him martin my husband i have killed him that is im not sure but 
 what 
 i have killed my husband 
 mrs straub 
 a tumor which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and thus influence your perception 
 and that is 
 there is of course another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case 
 listen its one thing to have a guilt complex but i know the difference between when im overstrung and when im seeing things that are simply not there besides it only began after we moved 
 how could i fail to notice that i have to go 
 hammer 
 yes something was 
 peculiar you mean like back then 
 i think its starting again you know there was something peculiar if only i knew 
 well it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it 
 we should leave the past alone 
 you didnt tell her 
 excuse us but do stop by for a visit sometime you are welcome anytime

 and buys a deadly poison he enters the tomb to say farewell to juliet who lies there cold as death he drinks the poison he dies by her side and then she wakes and sees him dead 
 thats me 
 i have not said all by malign fate the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friars plan he hears only that juliet is dead and thus he goes to the apothecary 
 by heaven i thank you i will be your apothecary 
 mr fennyman because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play i am writing an apothecary a small but vital role 
 of course it was mighty writing there is no one like marlowe

 good morrow cousin 
 thank you let go theres a good nurse 
 god bless you 
 i will 
 be good to her my lord 
 will you ask her majesty to be patient 
 be patient my lord she is dressing 
 not ready where is she 
 it would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her sixday lord and master 
 it would be better that you return tomorrow my lord 
 piety is for sunday and two hours at prayer is not piety it is self importance 
 lady viola is pious my lord 
 two hours at prayer 
 you will not tell as you love me and as i love you you will bind my breast and buy me a boys wig 
 my lady this play will end badly i will tell 
 oh nurse he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lessepss dreaming 
 he looks well enough for a mountebank 
 from tomorrow away in the country for three weeks is master shakespeare not handsome 
 your mother and your father 
 a comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of romeo to be the very same capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the pirate king 
 verona again 
 he sees himself in me romeo montague a young man of verona 
 but i would be valentine and silvia too good nurse god save you and good night i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players 
 as a nurse 
 no not the artful postures of love but love that over throws life unbiddable ungovernable like a riot in the heart and nothing to be done come ruin or rapture love like there has never been in a play i will have love or i will end my days as a 
 like valentine and silvia 
 all the men at court are without poetry if they look at me they see my fathers fortune i will have poetry in my life and adventure and love love above all 
 wellmonied is the same as wellborn and wellmarried is more so lord wessex was looking at you tonight 
 i am not so wellborn 
 playhouses are not for wellborn ladies 
 be still 
 but at the playhouse nurse 
 when the queen commands it 
 but silvia i did not care for much his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats oh when can we see another 
 i liked the dog for laughs 
 did you like proteus or valentine best proteus for speaking valentine for looks 
 oh but they can 
 but playwrights teach nothing about love they make it pretty they make it comical or they make it lust they cannot make it true 
 above lord wessex 
 and i love poetry above all 
 and 
 they are not acted for you they are acted for me 
 i love theatre to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed 
 speak out i know who i am do you love stories of kings and queens feats of arms or is it courtly love 
 your majesty 
 what do you love so much 
 your majesty 
 i have seen you you are the one who comes to all the playsat whitehall at richmond 
 stand up straight girl 
 your majesty 
 give it to master kent he will see it rightfully home wessex gives his purse to viola 
 fifty shillings pounds 
 lord wessex as i foretold has lost his wife in the play housego make your farewell and send her out its time to settle accounts how much was the wager 
 as stories must when loves deniedwith tears and a journey those whom god has joined in marriage not even i can put asunder 
 indeed i am a bride short how is this to end 
 why lord wessex lost your wife so soon 
 your majesty 
 there was a wager i rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love i think you lost it today you are an eager boy did you like the play 
 your majesty 
 by and by i come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief a thousand times good night 
 madam 
 i come anonbut if thou meanest not well i do beseech thee 
 madam 
 all my fortunes at thy foot i will lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world 
 go ask his nameif he be married my grave is like to be my wedding bed 
 i know not 
 i would have made you immortal tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare 
 will 
 burbage has my keeping but you have my heart 
 are you to be my muse rosaline 
 you left it in my bed come to look for it again 
 i have lost my gift 
 when will you write me a sonnet will 
 parting is such sweet sorrow 
 sam do me a speech do me a line 
 it is not my fault master shakespeare i could do it yesterday 
 luck be with you sam sam 
 master shakespeare 
 master henslowe you have your actors 
 no no a touch of cold only we suspect he is lying but will has turned away 
 but your voice have they dropped 
 i am master shakespeare 
 mr pope mr phillips welcome george bryan james armitage sam my pretty one are you ready to fall in love again 
 the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine 
 what satisfaction canst thou have tonight 
 o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied 
 i have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here 
 i would not for the world 
 she speaks 
 ay me 
 the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night see how she leans her cheek upon her hand o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek 
 sin from my lips oh trespass sweetly urgd give me my sin again 
 then have my lips the sin that they have took 
 thus from my lips by thine my sin is purgd 
 oh then dear saint let lips do what hands to they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair 
 ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer 
 have not saints lips and holy palmers too 
 i like her 
 as any mule in christendom but if you are the man to rider her their are rubies in the saddlebag 
 is she obedient 
 she will breed if she do not send her back 
 my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex is she fertile 
 she is a beauty my lord as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg 
 yes i know but he was always hanging around the house 
 but the plague 
 i have master shakespeare 
 you have opened the playhouses 
 what does burbage care of that he is readying the curtain for kit marlowe 
 so this is the favour you find in the chamberlains men 
 like you i found him not at home 
 i have to get back 
 wait you will see the cat bites his head off 
 oh what is your name 
 i like it when they cut heads off and the daughter mutilated with knives 
 you admire it 
 i was in a play they cut my head off in titus andronicus when i write plays they will be like titus 
 better fortune boy 
 i will be damned if you are 
 i am ethel sir the pirates daughter 
 who are you master 
 write me well 
 good bye my love a thousand times good bye 
 nor you for me 
 you will never age for me nor fade nor die 
 i dont know its a mystery 
 how does it 
 but all ends well 
 and thus unable to declare her love 
 but fearful of her virtue she comes to him dressed as a boy 
 orsinogood name 
 at sea thena voyage to a new worldshe lands upon a vast and empty shore she is brought to the dukeorsino 
 sold in marriage and half way to america 
 an excellent beginning let him bea duke and your heroine 
 a comedy what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom sick with love 
 the queen commands a comedy will for twelfth night 
 if my hurt is to be that you will write no more then i shall be the sorrier 
 i have hurt you and i am sorry for it 
 it was we ourselves did that and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise 
 i am done with theatre the playhouse is for dreamers look where the dream has brought us 
 a hired player no longer fifty pounds will for the poet of true love 
 i have more care to stay than will to go come death and welcome juliet wills it so how ist my soul lets talk it is not day 
 thou needst not to be gone 
 it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east nights candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops i must be gone and live or stay and die 
 wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day> it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree believe me love it was the nightingale 
 will you read it for me 
 but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows as solemn as they are unsanctified 
 nono 
 if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare 
 you cannot marry wessex 
 you were not dead before when i thought you dead i did not care about all the plays that will never come only that i would never see your face i saw our end and it will come 
 oh my love you ran from me before 
 i love you will beyond poetry 
 i was the more deceived 
 calf love i loved the writer and gave up the prize for a sonnet 
 my love is no lie i have a wife yes and i cannot marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that and yet you let me come to your bed 
 you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed 
 you lie 
 he was not dead before i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come 
 you never spoke so well of him 
 marlowes touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations 
 a literary feud quite normal 
 will what 
 stage fighting oh will as thomas kent my heart belongs to you but as viola the river divides us and i will marry wessex a week from saturday 
 i know how to fight 
 you cannot wessex will kill you 
 then i will go with you 
 you follow your desire freely enough in the night so if that is all to greenwich i go 
 to be the wife of a poor playercan i wish that for lady viola except in my dreams and yet i would if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day 
 what will you have me do marry you instead 
 you cannot not for the queen herself 
 yes this is not life will this is a stolen season 
 in heaven perhaps it is not a comedy i am writing now a broad river divides my loversfamily duty fateas unchangeable as nature 
 oh but it will end well for love 
 i found something in my sleep the friar who married them will take up their destinies 
 oh but it is mine too 
 thats my line 
 good night good night as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied 
 yes some of it is speakable 
 oh will 
 i must i must 
 oh do not go 
 it was the owl believe me love it was the owl 
 it is broad day the rooster tells us so 
 there is time it is still dark 
 ohno no 
 let him be damned for his pages 
 mr henslowe 
 oh let henslowe wait 
 it was the owlcome to bed 
 no the morning rooster woke me 
 moonlight 
 i must look how pale the window 
 you would not leave me 
 well perhaps better than my first 
 and that was only my first try 
 oh 
 even your play 
 there is 
 i would not have thought it there is something better than a play 
 it is strange to me too 
 i do not know how to undress a man 
 then kiss me again for i am not mistook 
 i am 
 answer me only this are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare 
 wait you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent 
 can you love a player 
 can you love a fool 
 oh not for the world 
 you can bring them with a word 
 if they find you here they will kill you 
 oh my lady my love 
 ohi am him too 
 alas indeed for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart 
 a lowly player 
 oh but why alas 
 the same alas 
 anon good nurse anon master shakespeare 
 will shakespeare 
 who is there 
 my lady 
 killed last night in a tavern come then we will say a prayer for his soul 
 he is dead 
 oh dear god i did not think it would be me to tell you a great loss to playwriting and to dancing 
 mourning who is dead my lord 
 and on a day of mourning i never met the fellow but once at your house 
 it is to be expected on a sunday 
 i understand of course it is to be expected 
 i am going to church 
 bless me i thought it was a horse 
 it is not my riding day my lord 
 you look sad my lady let me take you riding 
 lady viola isyoung in the world your majesty is wise in it nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting i will wager my fortune 
 i meanyour majesty they do not they have not but i believe there is one who can 
 ah my lady the tide waits for no man but i swear it would wait for you 
 good morning my lord 
 i will do my duty my lord 
 she wants to inspect you at greenwich come sunday be submissive modest grateful and brief 
 the queen has consented 
 will you defy your father and your queen 
 it was your eyes no your lips 
 but why me 
 why yes my fortune lies in my plantations the tobacco weed i need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to worki fancy tobacco has a future we will not stay there long three or four years 
 virginia 
 how your mind hops about your father was a shopkeeper your children will bear arms and i will recover my fortune that is the only matter under discussion today you will like virginia 
 i do not love you my lord 
 your father should keep you better informed he has bought me for you he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday you are allowed to show your pleasure 
 do you intend to marry my lord 
 no i have spoken to the queen her majestys consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife and once gained her consent is her command 
 you flatter my lord 
 i am aware of it but it is beautys privilege 
 lord wessex you have been waiting 
 my lady viola 
 so my lord i speak with him every day 
 i have spoken with your father 
 my lord 
 my lady viola 
 it is thomas but of good reputation come there is no harm in a drink 
 oh itsitsoh its a house of ill repute 
 for one kiss i would defy a thousand wessexes 
 but what of lord wessex 
 yes by god love knows nothing of rank or riverbank it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king and their love should be minded by each for love denied blights the soul we owe to god so tell my lady william shakespeare waits for her in the garden 
 i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance for what lady could live up to it close to when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine besides can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player 
 oh thomas a pair of pippins as round and rare as golden apples 
 what of her bosom 
 constantly without doubt and plays the lute she has a natural ear and her bosomdid i mention her bosom 
 she sings too 
 deeper softer none of your twittering larks i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song 
 and her voice like lark song 
 oh thomas her lips the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy 
 and her lips 
 oh if i could write the beauty of her eyes i was born to look in them and know myself 
 yes like rain and sun like cold and heat is your lady beautiful since i came to visit from the country i have not seen her close tell me is she beautiful 
 like a sickness and its cure together 
 yes my aunt but perhaps she wept a little tell me how you love her will 
 your aunt 
 i  her letter came to me by the nurse 
 no and yet she does where the ink has run with tears was she weeping when she gave you this 
 does she say so 
 she loves me thomas 
 it is only ours you can know 
 and break her heart and mine 
 if you love her you must do what she asks 
 she tells me to keep away she is to marry lord wessex what should i do 
 of course you have not i have not written it 
 i am very sorry sir i have not seen act two 
 he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet 
 no sir 
 do you understand me 
 yes sir 
 let me see you take off your hat 
 are you mr shakespeare 
 wait there

 with which of the following figures do you most closely identify joan of arc eva braun or marilyn monroe

 out in the woods three bodies decomposed mutilated beyond recognition

 yes 
 just one thing 
 oh no problems dont worry 
 sorry to waste your time 
 thats all 
 thats it then 
 no not any more i just wondered if it would surprise you 
 parked outside 
 what 
 well is it 
 yes i suppose so 
 and if i told you their car was parked outside would that surprise you 
 i dont know them 
 take another look at these two 
 i have never seen any of these men before 
 well then 
 no why should it 
 thats because he is does that upset you 
 it looks like hes writing everything down 
 what does it look like 
 are you recording it 
 this is just an informal discussion 
 is this being recorded 
 nothing we thought you were someone else 
 what 
 so tell me cameron what on earth just tell me because i want to know what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you 
 well yes 
 spacious quiet bright well appointed all that sort of stuff all that crap 
 yes 
 yes it is isnt it we alllike it and the rooms nice too dont you think 
 oh yes its great 
 and you like it 
 yes 
 good well you have seen the flat 
 yes thanks 
 well cameron are you comfortable 
 what 
 thats right 
 let him go let him take it all 
 stop him alex you have got to stop him 
 no 
 dont you ever stop 
 dont worry about it id do exactly the same but i dont think im his type 
 you mustnt take it so badly 
 the perfect couple i should say 
 its about me and david 
 thats what i thought he said 
 it makes us feel a whole lot better 
 oh shut up alex 
 of course but i think you will find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed 
 we were just sorting things out 
 i dont know i thought maybe i was 
 yes of course why wouldnt i be 
 are you all right 
 as smart as you are you will need a little help 
 what 
 alex 
 everything except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place ok thats important to me i need to die misunderstood 
 everything 
 and if it sounds like im being killed you will phone the police you will tell them everything 
 i will wait there 
 you will wait in the hall 
 no im not frightened a little terrified maybe did you see what happened to the last two who tried that they went up alive and they came down dead the difference i mean alive dead dead alive that sort of thing it wasnt difficult to spot he killed them both he cut them up 
 you are frightened 
 i refuse 
 its the only way 
 no definitely not and thats that i refuse to discuss it further 
 well im not expecting anyone either 
 arent you going to answer it 
 oh 
 no 
 expecting anyone 
 forget it he will come down 
 now you thought of that not me 
 where he cant get it 
 we could put it somewhere 
 and the money 
 he isnt safe up there if you really cared about him youd use your influence to get him down then hed be safe 
 forget it 
 he wont do anything for me but for you 
 oh good 
 exactly now i have been thinking 
 david 
 later but first him 
 your painful groin 
 we have to talk 
 what are you doing here 
 boy am i glad to see you 
 looking after it hes probably fucking well eating it 
 no but hes looking after the money so whats the problem 
 yeah hes got to go to work hasnt he you think he will come down for that 
 he will come down leave him alone 
 he cant stay up there 
 leave him alone 
 because thats no good remember we did what we did we took the money it was a material calculation but whats the use if its underground or in some funny bank in some funny place if you cant spend it if you cant have it what use is it none its nothing all for nothing if you do that i didnt get into this for nothing so that i could have nothing 
 i dont see the point in that 
 dont you 
 you know we are right 
 be like a weight off your shoulders 
 once its spent you wont have to worry about it 
 hes right youd feel much better about it 
 you know you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it thats my advice 
 i dont want it to taste different i dont know why i bother is that enough for you hey 
 it tastes different 
 i hope it tastes better than the other stuff 
 no no its different 
 is this the same stuff you made last week 
 yeah you are making us all nervous 
 will you calm down 
 then lets spend some money 
 no 
 are you all right 
 dont know no one said anything alex rendered speechless with desire i recall that feeling from the days when i had such a thing 
 who was it 
 hello hello 
 you were magnificent 
 well you certainly had a good look around 
 yes it is its him cameron cameron come on overyo 
 thats not him 
 whats he doing here 
 no i dont 
 cameron you remember cameron 
 who 
 look over there its cameron 
 its not for me its for love and happiness forever 
 david i promise we will keep him happy 
 for ever and ever 
 love and happiness for ever 
 i want my money back excuse me 
 sshh 
 i dont know why we couldnt stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being we could have hid it in the fridge 
 stop nagging 
 yeah we dont want another stiff on our hands dont fall through the ceiling ok is he listening to me 
 be careful 
 david 
 ok 
 whoever draws the short straw does it all that way you either do it or you dont all or nothing 
 and now you tell me 
 i dont want to its different 
 but you are a doctor you kill people every day 
 i dont thinki can 
 i thought we all were 
 whos going to do it 
 is that all 
 unfeasible 
 what 
 no alex its its 
 old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story be rational please and failing that be quiet 
 thats not a story alex its a corpse 
 its not every day i find a story in my own flat 
 nothe guys deadwhat more do you need 
 why not whats wrong juliet arent you curious dont you wonder what he died from 
 no 
 dont look 
 dont 
 im just looking 
 what are you doing 
 what whats wrong 
 alex 
 i wonder how he killed himself i presume that thats what happened what do you think 
 did what 
 i wonder how he did it 
 all right no problem 
 yes 
 now 
 yes 
 you want me to kick it open 
 open it 
 so 
 alex the key is in the keyhole on the other side 
 hugo hugo sorry about this but can you open the door its us hugo your flatmates and companions your newfound friends hes not in hes left and we will probably never see him again 
 a blue one ok and its still there 
 i will ask you once more what sort of car 
 alex how shouldi know im just a girl 
 what sort of car 
 so whats wrong with that 
 hes got a car 
 his cars still there 
 hugo 
 david 
 maybe he didnt like us 
 so i gathered 
 david hasnt seen him either 
 no any idea which channel hes on 
 have you seen hugo 
 no alex we dont really love you 
 you see they dont really know me 
 you are right 
 i think you are lying 
 yeah 
 know and love 
 a miserable burntout empty shell of a alex pauses looks at his drink then at juliet 
 the man we know and love 
 which is a hack 
 which is 
 what i am 
 instead of what he is 
 it was you juliet it was you 
 in a moment hes going to tell he could have been someone 
 not usually this drunk 
 im not usually drunk 
 he even signs them in his own name can you believe it id sign someone elses name id sign his name if i wrote them that is which i dont 
 alex 
 aroused and inflamed 
 what oh yeah sure if you want i tell you every letter this guy writes to you is the same they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography i dream of your thighs the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire while i aroused and inflamed 
 so we will meet him then 
 i dont know he sounded swedish do you know any swedish men maybe it was just the emotion 
 who was it 
 he seemed like a nice guy alex 
 has he tried down the back of the fridge i mean thats where i normally find things 
 id be the first topoint that out in all kindness i would but like they say you know shes got to want to change hasnt she 
 more than anyone she has ever met in her whole life 
 well she had problems 
 she hated you 
 no be someone else like him one is enough and what happened to that girl that friend of yours the one that came round i liked her i really felt we had something she could have moved in we had chemistry 
 for the flat 
 for my life at a discussion group i think not 
 maybe you should go alexyou will meet someone wonderful 
 god you two are sensitive all im doing is implying some sort of sordid ugly sexual liason why id be proud of that sort of thing 
 yeah he had one too many of thise urges you of all people should know that 
 i thought you stopped going 
 just serve 
 did you know 
 ok so a has left you b is ambivalent you are still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for what are we to make of this if i were you id ditch the lot theres a lot more letters in the alphabet of love 
 and when did anyone last say to you these exact words you are the sunshine of my life 
 now let me get this straight this affair that you are not having is it not with a man or not with a woman 
 when you get up in the morning how do you decide what shade of black to wear 
 i mean what are you actually doing here what is the hidden agenda 
 when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands do you then summon hellfire 
 really 
 yes 
 cameron 
 cameron 
 yeah 
 can you afford this place 
 well thats what i said isnt it 
 you mean i can have the room 
 its ok theres no problem 
 what was i trying to say oh yes i think we think or at least i suppose we think am i right 
 you were going to say something 
 what 
 what 
 so uh 
 yeah well thats what she said interesting thats why you are here you see 
 i see 
 interesting 
 that wasnt a question 
 yes 
 you are sure of that 
 no i have never seen them 
 yeah thats right thats it 
 is this where no one stays 
 someone lost the key 
 loks like you had a breakin up here as well 
 i dont know maybe im a light sleeper 
 yes why do you think you woke and they didnt 
 no they were asleep they didnt even wake up 
 i doubt it and these two other people did they hear anything 
 i see 
 take a note of that mitchell only three rather than four write it down you can use numbers or words i have no preference which are you using 
 yes absolutely 
 how strange and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information only three people here you are sure 
 no three who said there were four 
 we understood there were four people living here not always of course but now four 
 who said there were four 
 two 
 there are only two other people in the flat 
 and the other three people on the flat did they hear anything 
 of course 
 well if you do you will let us know 
 no nothing sorry 
 have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days 
 no not that i recall i was asleep 
 did you hear anything before he cries 
 so i just heard her cries for help and all that and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there so i just stood around really waiting you know how people do and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs and thats about all i think i didnt actually see anything useful i dont think 
 can we come in 
 of course 
 downstairs 
 burglary 
 its about the burglary 
 what about 
 good evening im detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell i wonder if we could ask you some questions 
 dont lie to me dont treat me like that 
 it wasnt like that 
 but i bet you didnt say you were going to split on him 
 thats right you are going to rio rio de janeiro on your own come on you should know you bought the fucking ticket 
 what 
 oh dont be so coy dear you are going to rio 
 eh i dont know 
 and you need your sleep 
 yes 
 you and me 
 so lets go

 i have never seen a dead body before 
 yes 
 is this what they always look like 
 keep it going alex you are unstoppable now 
 just get on with it alex 
 did you ever kill a man 
 its just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is quite simply just that 
 ok im going to play you just a few seconds of this tape id like you to name the song the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band 
 look its a fairly straightforward question you are either divorced or you are not

 you get the job done 
 im boring 
 and thats why i think you fit in here

 not things that anyone can notice but things that people who shine can see just like they can see things that havent happened yet well sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago i think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years and not all of them was good 
 well maybe things that happened leave other kinds of traces behind 
 well you know doc when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind say like is someone burns toast 
 is there something bad here 
 no im scared of nothing here its just that you know some places are like people some shine and some dont i guess you could say the overlook hotel here has something about it thats like shining 
 try to think what it was

 sure danny it will be lots of fun 
 do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter 
 yeah 
 yes id like you to 
 do i have to 
 now im going to ask you to do me a favor and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day okay 
 does tony ever tell you to do things 
 to my stomach 
 where does he go 
 because he hides 
 why not 
 no 
 if you were to open your mouth now could i see tony 
 oh 
 no its the little boy that lives in my mouth 
 is tony one of your animals 
 talking to tony 
 now danny can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth 
 mommy saying wake up wake up wake up danny wake up 
 whats the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth 
 yes 
 do you remember when you were brushing your teeth 
 no 
 now danny when you were brushing your teeth do you remember if you smelled anything funny or saw any bright flashing lights or anything at all strange 
 well its just one of those things you know purely an accident um my husband had oh been drinking and he came home about three hours late so he wasnt exactly in the greatest mood that night and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room and my husband grabbed his arm you know and pulled him away from them itsits just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child you know in a park or on the streets but on this particular occasion my husband just used too much strength and he injured dannys arm 
 how did he manage to do that 
 ah he dislocated his shoulder 
 what sort of injury did he have 
 no um lets see i guess danny started talkin to tony about the time we put him into nursery school 
 did tonys first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here 
 tony 
 did the appearance of dannys imaginary friend 
 only about three months eh we are from vermont my husband was teaching school there 
 have you been in boulder long mrs torrance 
 mrs torrance most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained they are brought on by emotional factors and they rarely occur again 
 but eh what was the matter with him 
 oh yeah oh yeah he seems absolutely fine now but you should have seen him 
 mrs torrance i dont think you have anything to worry about im quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny 
 thank you 
 please 
 yes 
 shall we go into the living room 
 great sit down oh these marvellous doughnuts help yourself coffee will be ready in a few minutes 
 sure 
 well im going to have some coffee would you like some 
 its okay really 
 well how can i repay you 
 oh i wouldnt think of it 
 you give your word on that do you mr torrance 
 theres nothing i look forward to with the greater pleasure mr grady 
 i fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way mr torrance i fear that is the only thing to do 
 for the moment mr grady only for the moment 
 your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined mr torrance somewhat more resourceful she seems to have got the better of you 
 just give me one more chance to prove it mr grady thats all i ask 
 will you indeed mr torrance 
 no need to rub it in mr grady i will deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here 
 grady oh 
 its grady mr torrance delbert grady 
 perhaps they need a good talking to if you dont mind my saying so perhaps a bit more 
 she eh interferes 
 well he is a very willful boy 
 your son has a very great talent i dont think you are aware how great it is but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will 
 how 
 a nigger cook 
 a nigger 
 a nigger 
 who 
 he is mr torrance 
 no 
 oh they are somewhere around im not quite sure at the moment sir 
 and er where are they now 
 yes sir i have a wife and eh two daughters sir 
 why no sir i dont believe so 
 eh mr grady werent you once the caretaker here

 awfully nice of you to say of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree 
 that doesnt matter sir you are the important one 
 yes sir look um i think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemens room sir and eh 
 advocaat is it

 hallo this is dick halloran again i called a while ago about the folks at the overlook hotel 
 good evening forest service

 of course you are 
 of course i am 
 jack 
 as soon as possible 
 when do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor 
 yes 
 you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor 
 well i i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor 
 i dont think thats true i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny and id like to know what they are 
 i dont know 
 you cant remember 
 i cant really remember 
 i 
 how do you like it 
 jack 
 wendy i have let you fuck up my life so far but im not going to let you fuck this up 
 jack 
 shovellings out driveways work in a car wash any of that appeal to you 
 yes 
 you mean just leave the hotel

 get him out of here 
 i think he did it to himself 
 somebody did that to him 
 good 
 hes still asleep 
 absolutely nothing how is he 
 and you didnt see anything at all 
 yes i did 
 you went into the room danny said to N 
 no nothing at all 
 did you find anything 
 which room was it 
 no its the truth really i swear it danny told me he went up into one of the bedrooms the door was open and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub she tried to strangle him 
 i dreamed that i that i killed you and danny 
 its okay its okay now really 
 i had i had the most terrible nightmare i ever had its the most horrible dream i ever had 
 fine why dont you start right now and get the fuck out of here hmm 
 yes 
 or whether you dont hear me typing whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here when i am in here that means that i am working that means dont come in now do you think you can handle that 
 fine now we are going to make a new rule whenever i am in here and you hear me typing 
 yes 
 and it will then take me time to get back to where i was understand 
 wendy let me explain something to you whenever you come in here and interrupt me you are breaking my concentration 
 okay i understand i will come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and maybe you will let me read something then 
 im not being grouchy i just want to finish my work 
 ah come on hon dont be so grouchy 
 what do you want me to do about it 
 yeah its amazing how fast you get used to such a big place i tell you when we first came up here i thought it was kinda scarey 
 i love it i really do i have never been this happy or comfortable anywhere 
 its really nice up here isnt it 
 yeah thats all it is 
 well something will come its just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day 
 lots of ideas no good ones 
 any ideas yet 
 oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first 
 its really pretty outside how about taking me for a walk after you have finished your breakfast 
 hmm nice 
 i made em just the way you like em sunny side up 
 i know it 
 i guess we have been staying up too late 
 eleven thirty jesus 
 its about eleven thirty 
 what time is it 
 good morning hon your breakfast is ready 
 yeah 
 perfect for a child 
 god i have never seen anything like this before are all of these indian designs authentic 
 sure is 
 uhhuh 
 boy we must be really high up the air feels so different 
 great look im at the hotel and i still have an awful lot to go through i dont think i can get home before nine or ten 
 hi hon hows it going 
 hi babe 
 well its very homely 
 yes very cosy for a family and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in 
 oh 
 id better collect my family first 
 oh fine well in view of all the ground that we to cover today i suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away 
 right there 
 oh has your luggage been brought in 
 no my sons discovered the games room 
 good glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen is your family having a look around 
 no problem in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat 
 good morning jack i hope you havent been waiting too long 
 well you can rest assured mr ullman thats not going to happen with me and eg as far as my wife is concerned i am sure she will be absolutely fascinated when i tell her about it shes a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict 
 put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened 
 well obviously some people can be 
 well that is eh quite a story 
 shut in together over long periods of time 
 the police eh they thought that it was what the oldtimers used to call cabinfever a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are 
 well my predecessor in this job 
 i dont believe they did 
 i dont suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of N 
 im intrigued 
 been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job 
 great 
 they will love it 
 how about your wife and son how do you think they will take to it 
 not for me 
 can of itself be a problem 
 thats very good jack because eh for some people eh solitude and isolation 
 five months of peace is just what i want 
 well that just happens to be exactly what im looking for im eh im outlining a new writing project and eh 
 physically its not a very demanding job the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh the tremendous sense of isolation 
 well that sounds fine to me 
 the winters can be fantastically cruel and the basic idea is toto cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur and this consists mainly of running the boiler heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs so that the elements cant get a foothold 
 well 
 only in a very general way 
 oh it sure would be 
 do you mind if i ask why you do that it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic 
 lets see where were we yes i was about to explain that eh our season here runs from oh may N th to october N th and then we close down completely until the following may 
 susie 
 well if you are going to have some i wouldnt mind thanks 
 jack just make yourself at home would you like some coffee 
 well thats very good time very good please sit down a minute 
 oh no problem at all i made the trip in three and a half hours 
 have any trouble finding us 
 nice to meet you mr ullman 
 very nice to meet you 
 oh well come on in jack 
 im jack torrance 
 yes 
 mr ullman 
 yes 
 just like a ghost ship huh 
 by five oclock tonight you will never know anybody was ever here 
 yes well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday but the last day is always very hectic everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible 
 its amazing how much activity is going on today 
 how are you getting on 
 hi 
 hi 
 thank you susie 
 thanks 
 boy i bet you we could really have a good party in this room huh hon 
 we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably 
 oh i will say 
 ohwell this is our gold ballroom 
 oh well he sure did a beautiful job pink and gold are my favorite colors 
 as a matter of fact we eh brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel 
 oh 
 this is the staff wing of the hotel none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter 
 all the best people 
 royalty 
 even before anybody knew what a jet set was we have had four presidents who stayed here lots of movie stars 
 oh well they are really gorgeous as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i have ever seen 
 yes i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs 
 oh its beautiful my god this place is fantastic isnt it hon 
 this is our colorado lounge 
 fine 
 bill would you have the torrances things brought in their apartment 
 well that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first 
 eight thirty 
 what time does the plane leave 
 jack is a schoolteacher 
 fine 
 jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through 
 how do you do 
 bill id like you to meet jack torrance

 can i tell you kids something 
 i dont know maybe he doesnt know either 
 would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with 
 jesus 
 blue this blue 
 lowes car 
 why hasnt he picked up the phone and told constable haller that someone is sending him poisonpen letters 
 i dont accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is jane because i dont accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair 
 if father lowe is an innocent little lamb why hasnt he picked up the telephone and called constable haller to tell him martys sending poisonpen letters 
 uncle al 
 holyjumpedupbaldheadedjesuschrist 
 you are a real booger you know it 
 all except my legs i dont think i can walk 
 are you all right marty

 went shopping why 
 wheres mom 
 marty you okay you have just been sitting here all morning 
 let me help you up 
 yes go away

 what do you expect when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed 
 mom was really mad at him this time wasnt she 
 it was bradys idea jane honest to god please take the money i want to make up 
 i dont want your money you are a booger 
 a new pair of panty hose is it enough 
 whats the money for 
 if you dont stop it im going to vomit i mean it 
 did he really get his head cut off dad thats what brady said 
 bradys a booger and so are you 
 come on jane it was bradys idea i couldnt stop him 
 you always take his side because hes a cripple well its not my fault that hes a cripple 
 okay have you got enough gas to get home marty 
 yeah but if you hear any more noises tell your father okay 
 well its probably nothing im just spooked since you know 
 and my dad says its kids but its not rats and its not kids its 
 rats 
 rattling rustling 
 what kind of noises 
 i have been hearing noises in there 
 what 
 theres something else scary 
 hey take it easy i know how you feel 
 i used to see her every day and she never knew what was going to happen to her and neither did i i mean i know how stupid that sounds but 
 well it is his third 
 for getting a divorce 
 glasspack he said hed come over sometime this summer and wed soup up the engine but now i dunno hes getting a divorce and hes in the doghouse with my mother 
 whats that 
 not bad huh my uncle al took off the regular muffler and put on a cherry bomb 
 thats what my sister says too pretty soon im going to start checking the mirror to see if im turning green 
 you booger 
 then id have to kick your ass dear boy go on now 
 what if i say no 
 i know what i said marty but its ten past one hes not coming 
 but uncle al you said 
 i suppose so you kids ought to go up to bed 
 yeah really the bitch of it is we still are learn from your elders dearies 
 yeah really 
 will you do it 
 dear boy you have gone right out of your mind 
 i think hes going to come for me not just because i know who he is but because i hurt him only i dont think he will try again as lowe 
 the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit a french jesuit 
 no one knows how cancer begins either or exactly what it is but people still believe in it 
 marty the moon wasnt even full 
 i saw what i saw 
 you are not going to let it go are you 
 i want you to turn this into a silver bullet 
 and what do you suggest i do about it dear boy 
 mr haller said hed check him out and guess what no one sees him again 
 no 
 what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down you dont think that was a dream do you 
 it could have been anything marty 
 there you see 
 no but i found some blood smeared on a tree trunk in that grove 
 i told you 
 after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder i did hes had no poisonpen complaints lodged at all 
 shut up dear boy no gloating allowed 
 i told you 
 well its a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws also i checked on the otic solution it was counter brand no prescription needed 
 when he was a werewolf yes right jesus jane you dont really believe this madness do you 
 i didnt shoot him when he was a man i shot him when he was 
 do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn hed either be in the hospital or dead 
 marty do you see your suspect 
 i will bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription and i will bet you another quarter he hasnt said anything to mr haller 
 watch it dear boy i think it was a hallucination probably a broomstick or something 
 no we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face 
 you want to know what i think 
 what about the baseball bat jane saw in his shed you know who used to have a baseball bat like that mr knopfler he was so proud of it he used to carry it in the fourth of july parade jane said it looked like the green giant used it for a toothpick 
 i dont know but i know you didnt see any werewolf the other night marty you had a dream thats all an extremely realistic nightmare brought on by whats been happening in this town 
 well was it a prescription 
 marty marty you should hear yourself 
 it wasnt i will bet you it wasnt because to get a prescription hed have to see a doctor 
 what the hell does that matter 
 was it a prescription 
 i called peltzer on my way over here marty father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution thats a fancy way of saying eyewash hes got a corneal inflammation 
 it came for me i shot it in the eye now hes wearing an eyepatch 
 you are welcome a million marty stick em in the bushes for now 
 thanks a million uncle al 
 a tracer you will like it 
 what is it 
 save this one for last 
 yeah sure 
 one of the reasons i love you marty is that you are almost as crazy as i am please dont set off anything that goes bang tonight okay just bright colors can you tell the difference

 get moving im right behind you 
 hurry sister 
 this is so exhilarating all week long i cant wait till sunday when we sing 
 jackpot two buckets 
 that man who is he 
 what is it mary 
 and we know that even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite the lowest slug of humanity we know that deep down inside you are probably even worse and so you truly need our prayers 
 we know you dont want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors we will pray to find you some honest work 
 because we are 
 spring is here the sun will shine i will be his and he will be mine we will love until the end of time and we will never be lonely anymore 
 so use it when we sing hymns they are usually about rejoicing right celebration most music is so dont hold back let all that joy go right into your voice make me happy let me hear it perk out perk down 
 all right i am i know it all my life i have just been upbeat optimistic perky i cant help it even when i was little i remember my mother used to say that child is pure sunshine she will either be a nun or a stewardess

 hold it mary patrick you are a pretty cheerful person arent you 
 the dixie cups oh my i was just a girl of course spring is here the sun will shine

 but dont you get money from the vatican 
 to sell of course i hate to say it but we are in terrible trouble here at st katherines we need a new roof the furnace is going and theres no money 
 why 
 well it all comes back in just a jiffy im working on a wallhanging of the convent 
 not in years 
 the minute i saw you i said to myself shes a weaver have you ever used a loom 
 no hey he knows that you been creating now you are gonna get a beating 
 N N mary clarence thats when many of us took final vows its the last secular music we recall 
 i havent heard that song in ages the ronettes 
 where did that come from

 isnt it a glorious morning good morning mary clarence sleep well 
 sing 
 just sing 
 you re okay for a civilian 
 hey you re supposed to be the cheerful one why do i suddenly feel like snow white 
 you know about me about everything 
 van cartier 
 thats true wouldnt that be great of course we never know when things are going to change any one of us could be transferred to another convent tomorrow 
 we could cut a demo look for a label 
 well see at my old convent i wasnt always real popular i was sort of selfish and not real helpful okay i will say it i wasnt much of a nun but now thanks to all of you maybe im shaping up

 a bunch of real mamas girls 
 wet behind the ears 
 i dont know mary lazarus what do you think they are pretty raw 
 i hear you how many days a week do you rehearse 
 of course im a nun four popes now the lord hates a loafer 
 mary lazarus i get the feeling that you like discipline hard work 
 i knew that 
 yeah for one second that was the blend you have got to listen to each other be a group 
 mary robert 
 very nice sisters have we learned our lesson i wont hold this little episode against anyone i will try not to 
 you are a ringer she brought you in to replace me out with the old 
 what 
 freelance oh really you think i dont see you think i took vows yesterday i know what you are up to you and reverend mother 
 sure kind of freelance 
 um i dont really know this one 
 mary clarence are you with us 
 whatever 
 soprano or alto 
 you know that song 
 shirelles 
 i like my old convent in vancouver out in the woods it wasnt all modern like here no electricity cold water bare feet those were nuns it was hell on earth but i loved it this place is a hilton 
 like this place 
 progressive convents vanity it sounds awful it sounds just like this place 
 what 
 enough jabber 
 which convent it was um the little sisters of the moonlight in vegas everybody used to come to mass frank dean sammy right at ringside 
 he said sing the devil away 
 what did he say 
 but the lord came to me 
 dont you know it 
 i was hellbound yes thats what they say satan was waiting 
 its true 
 i was downhearted 
 bless you 
 mary clarence 
 shes got nothing to do with this let her go 
 but what do they want where are we going 
 again 
 run take off 
 they are from my old convent 
 wait this isnt the way who are you 
 right to hell just kidding where is that bus 
 the council of cardinals im so nervous what if i forget the words 
 oh no we will always be together 
 are you leaving us 
 a thankyou for what you are the one we should be thanking 
 its contraband dont ask but i wanted to give you a treat a sort of thankyou gift 
 we are nuns 
 yes prayer is the answer and prayers free we are going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house 
 honor thy mother and thy father too dont kill dont steal its bad for you 
 we are the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit now do your part 
 give me a c a c 
 i dont want to mess anyone up 
 mary robert i have watched you you never really sing you whisper nothing comes out 
 what 
 now stop that you didnt shoot at me you were only trying to help to give me experience i tried to explain that to reverend mother but i dont know if she understood 
 mary robert i am so sorry about last night 
 we could have been killed but you saved me thank you mary clarence 
 i dont know some people just dont like nuns i wish i had a ruler 
 what was all that who was that man why would he shoot at us 
 experience 
 oh my lord 
 mary clarence 
 goddamn it 
 keep moving 
 mary clarence 
 well you know you dont have to tell her everything i mean nothing really happened we just took a walk 
 i cant wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences i have learned so much 
 honey 
 mary clarence you are so different from the other sisters sometimes well sometimes you sound more like a layperson 
 good point especially that dude you were with id like to see him down front 
 those people are wonderful why dont we ever see them in church 
 you watch yourself 
 im getting experience 
 this is your neighborhood your turf you should get to know em 
 who are all these people 
 really 
 initiation you understand later on we make her wear her underwear on her head 
 i have to do this so i can become a nun 
 right 
 experience right 
 bobs 
 its part of st katherines new community outreach program how old are you you shouldnt be smoking have you ever seen a diseased lung hand em over 
 we need experience 
 now you 
 mary clarence 
 are you sure 
 we must get you some experience we must leave this place 
 of course we must do it its the will of god what is it 
 we must do this sacred thing mary robert 
 reverend mother says you need experience right in life in order to make a responsible decision this is going to be very painful for me you know how much i love this little room this whole convent wait 
 what 
 well then theres only one thing to do 
 she said that reverend mother 
 she says i should wait she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life she says that im not experienced enough to make the decision yet in a mature manner 
 she wont why not 
 oh mary clarence im so unworthy i want to take my final vows i would do it tomorrow but reverend mother wont let me 
 excuse me 
 no you dont understand i dont want to get out i want to get in 
 right sure but whats the problem are they keeping you a prisoner here do they drug you did reverend mother like kidnap your parents we can call the enquirer 
 you have to help me 
 yeah like a learners permit right when do you hit the big time you know when do you take the final vows 
 a novice 
 three years a rookie 
 three years sister 
 so bob how long have you been in st ks 
 right okay bob nice to know you 
 mary robert im mary robert 
 thanks so which one are you sister bruce sister doug 
 an extra heel of bread please take it you need your strength you have been working so hard 
 a cigarette 
 i i brought you something 
 what 
 i i 
 what what does she want now i did the dishes i oiled the pews i dusted the hymnals two hundred hymnals why cant people share 
 five am 
 its after five we have to bathe 
 what what time is it 
 come on we are late 
 dont push it 
 really and maybe shorter habits and women priests and sleeping late 
 perhaps not perhaps we can all use a little spandex 
 what about me reverend mother i think you were right im just a bad influence sister show biz 
 you have evidenced great maturity mary robert we shall have a serious discussion 
 i dont think so what about skydiving a crank call to billy graham 
 very well i hold you responsible for all of this for introducing a lounge act into my convent for utterly disrupting our way of life and for placing all of us in mortal danger thankyou 
 then i guess you are stuck life sentence no parole 
 im a christian 
 you saved my life 
 oh 
 reverend mother thankyou 
 saving you move 
 what are you doing here 
 good day 
 but 
 i am sorry mary clarence i seem to have misplaced my tambourine good day mary clarence 
 okay so i just got things started but you could build on that you could keep it going 
 you and i know that life is not so simple there will be disappointments rude shocks and you will have vanished how fortunate 
 a part of what mary clarence it is one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into town and declare a holiday you have raised the sisters expectations you have excited and confused them they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party 
 but everything thats happening is good you can be a part of it 
 indeed after how long a few weeks i have been here thirty years and yet it would seem i know nothing 
 but theres so much more to do right here and look if its about me i mean im gone 
 i must go where i can be of use 
 but why 
 i have submitted my resignation to bishop ohara privately i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible 
 what 
 really well that makes two of us 
 hey your prayers have been answered im leaving in just a couple of days 
 you have a phone call 
 you sent for me 
 the majority has spoken 
 but wait a minute 
 of course mary clarence a convent is not a totalitarian state most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole a membership that i am certain will vote in a rational and pious manner all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program 
 a vote 
 i believe this can be settled by a simple vote 
 isnt that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals 
 the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church they command the utmost respect your more secular entertainment would be wholly out of place 
 what do you mean 
 and on such an occasion i feel a completely traditional program will be best 
 and i am refusing as of tomorrow mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir 
 please let me try im begging you 
 out of the question 
 hold on thats not fair i worked hard with them they gave up their free time and they loved it those women are happy and we can get even better we can wake this place up 
 through blasphemy you have corrupted the entire choir 
 exactly people like going to theaters and casinos but they think church is for grandma we could change that pack the joint 
 and what next popcorn curtain calls this is not a theater or a casino 
 i was thinking las vegas get some butts in those seats 
 the choir mary clarence go for the gold 
 not the choir please anything but that the choir i mean have you heard them i will do anything scrub floors toilets you name it but not that i 
 you are my olympic event 
 no no 
 you will sing and you will sleep that is your schedule until you depart as almost no one attends mass you will be unable to cause further damage 
 you have i believe some minimal background in music therefore you are to join our choir 
 what 
 you may stay but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task 
 i am 
 mary clarence perhaps you are correct 
 but you cant kick me out guys want to kill me you are a nun a big nun arent you supposed to have compassion for the wayward sheep i mean im a major sinner alltime great hall of fame arent i like your dream come true your olympic event 
 clearly you have learned nothing and you present an ongoing threat both to this convent and to yourself 
 a decent life excuse me as what a janitor 
 mary clarence i have given you every opportunity to change to make a decent life for yourself 
 i know im sorry i didnt mean for it to happen and i was the one they were shooting at 
 mary roberts life was in danger your behavior was inexcusable 
 look i know i shouldnt have im incredibly sorry about mary robert i wasnt thinking i didnt know that would happen 
 i dont believe we have anything to say to each other 
 so hi there 
 look this isnt my kind of thing i wasnt cut out to make little tapestries or knit little sweaters i dont do that im a star 
 months of work and the loom absolutely ruined 
 im sorry im not a weaver 
 good mary patrick i need you in the office mary clarence carry on 
 really catching on 
 how to put it ah of course mary clarence no pain no gain 
 in english 
 do your recall the words of saint peter in ecciesiastes N he spoke unto a wastrel youth he said take up thy task and know ye the path of contentment 
 it never solves anything 
 you are correct sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation such as your own for example how do you feel about physical labor 
 sometimes its not enough 
 we are nuns we seek solutions through prayer 
 have you been out in those streets do you know what those kids are up against you should help them 
 this is a convent not a clinic we offer moral guidance not hardware 
 those girls were asking questions they have got it rough i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age i wish somebody would talk to me about it now 
 a balloon and a banana tell me mary clarence what were you thinking 
 mary clarence 
 deal with it sweet thing its important nowadays you just practice at home with a balloon and a banana 
 come sister 
 i got it 
 girls this is sister mary clarence she will be minding you until sister mary patricks return mary clarence please assign a biblical passage do not attempt discussion am i understood 
 yeah 
 from all i have heard just about everything your singing career seems all but nonexistent and your married lover wants you dead 
 whats wrong with my life 
 im sure if i were you i would use this time to think about my life and its direction or lack thereof 
 wait no you are kidding lights out at nine my days just starting 
 it is nine pm pleasant dreams 
 right so what do we do now ping pong row over to the monastery 
 your cell is more than adequate 
 oh i dont know satan 
 and whom would you call 
 its like the stone age the room time forgot what about a phone 
 useless distractions 
 right sure thing but what about like appliances like a little color portable boom box 
 our lives are simple we have little need for material possessions 
 you were right the first time is this like solitary the cooler wheres the furniture 
 your cell your room 
 my what 
 this shall be your cell mary clarence 
 thats tomorrow dont you have any snacks machines 
 yes until breakfast 
 is this all the food i get 
 no food not until sundown 
 no food

 the vow of obedience

 the mary is in deference to the holy mother the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola there are three vows that every nun must accept the vow of poverty 
 mary clarence like a guy like a dumb guy

 i joined this convent some thirty years ago at that time the world knew some measure of peace and hope our order was a beacon of hospitality to families to children to a neighborhood filled with promise and as the years have passed i have watched that promise destroyed drugs gangs spandex and so i have made this convent an oasis a retreat from horror and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls

 so take it off 
 right 
 you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot 
 it didnt work vince 
 well 
 yeah 
 i cant believe this okay i want both you guys to go back there and both of you shoot her at the same time 
 it didnt happen 
 but vince how do you know she didnt like join up and become a nun when she was in that convent 
 whats the problem 
 not totally 
 its done 
 you know so much they have got christy and we have got to find her get her N xN from in front of the lounge fax it to every contact we got 
 its a bluff vince 
 hes so damn cocky this is different 
 take care of it 
 and if she runs 
 maybe 
 vince is she okay 
 shes praying 
 whats she doing 
 and then we can ice her no nun no evil eye 
 a sweater 
 for like twelve zillion eternities 
 strip down a nun you want us to fry 
 thats what i figured too 
 i figured if you were gonna then i wouldnt have to 
 neither did you 
 you didnt shoot 
 no smartass remarks or nothing 
 she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car 
 forget her we got the one we need step on it 
 shes gettin away 
 yeah right when i see it 
 so that guy in the bar was right shes like some kind of nun 
 we cant leave it up to the feds 
 we have got to save her 
 that should have tipped us 
 look what she did with the choir she made us sing beautifully 
 we are losing it 
 we sound terrible we need mary clarence 
 dress rehearsal at four performance at N sharp 
 it should be here any minute 
 is it worth it a lot of witnesses here 
 are you going to shoot us all tough guy 
 measles 
 however we can also pray for other things 
 peace on earth 
 all right its a beginning las vegas nevada 
 she told us about one the little sisters of the moonlight in las vegas 
 but why would anyone kidnap a nun 
 she shouldnt have come back she knew she was in danger 
 really 
 bless her there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve thats why many of us became nuns its marvelous reverend mother 
 oh shes doing just fine reverend mother 
 mary clarence how is your weaving progressing 
 i need to see you at once girls please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments mary clarence 
 yes 
 sister mary patrick 
 reverend mother on behalf of the sisters id like to welcome mary clarence to st katherines 
 yes mary patrick 
 impossible 
 not a note 
 christy 
 mary clarence you are alive 
 a benedictine 
 excuse me has anyone seen a nun 
 but how do we get there 
 the little sisters of the moonlight 
 and what a lovely name las vegas 
 its so beautiful 
 shes our inspiration 
 well i dont care who she is we cant sing without her 
 she wasnt a nun 
 an entertainer 
 yes two men and they had guns 
 you mean they kidnapped her 
 we will pray and she will be there 
 we cant sing without her what should we do 
 its no use she just isnt here 
 mary clarence sister 
 maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us 
 mary clarence dont be silly you are an example to us all you have taught us so much we are singing for the cardinals and then who knows maybe the choir can travel to schools and nursing homes 
 mary clarence you shouldnt have where did you get this 
 ice cream 
 its brought people back to the church 
 but reverend mother everyone loves our new style 
 its better than springtime 
 its better than ice cream 
 id rather sing than do anything 
 hes kind 
 hes decent 
 hes not like other guys 
 that was exciting 
 we did it we actually sang a chord 
 really mary clarence were you a choirmistress 
 mary clarence has a background in music thats what reverend mother said 
 which convent was that sister 
 is this like your old convent 
 since mary clarence came to st katherines i have been shot at kidnapped by mafia hit men and i have tasted beer is that enough experience yet for final vows 
 yes 
 reverend mother 
 but where 
 las vegas shes here somewhere 
 but she was a showgirl she didnt have an old convent 
 she said they were from her old convent 
 calm down think clearly mary robert do you have any idea who those men were 
 her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her pull yourselves together 
 i dont understand where is she 
 and you will face that danger headon as if i could stop you and you have my complete support in this matter anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing 
 but bishop surely you realize this is a most dangerous neighborhood 
 i know 
 i lied 
 st katherines is a benedictine order you have taken a vow of hospitality to all in need 
 but bishop 
 your small convent is in danger of closing reverend mother the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation 
 we are a small convent bishop surely there are more appropriate shelters 
 and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation 
 but shes been exposed to the underside of life she is the underside of life 
 we can save this young womans life and imprison a parasite all in one gesture 
 absolutely not i am very sorry but no 
 find em 
 where 
 okay so the problem is still the nun outfit right 
 we both missed 
 are you nuts shes not a nun its christy shes a babe 
 shes shes a nun 
 shes acting weird vince ever since we picked her up 
 and who are you to talk you were nothing you couldnt even sing i must have been out of my mind 
 i love you chris i always will i gave you so much my time my affection a bigtime career and how do you repay me whats the thanks i get wheres the loyalty huh wheres the love 
 shes a nun vince 
 can you hold can you try 
 its that call you were expecting vince 
 soon you gorgeous thing tell me how lonely 
 she did bring her back now for a talk 
 i mean wont she talk she seemed kind of upset 
 he came to me he promised great violence said i should cast you out for my own protection i must speak honestly there is no reason to think he will not meet with success 
 how did you hear this 
 clergyman steenwyck is calling a meeting this time he is determined to have you forced out or worse 
 sarah has gone missing my servant girl her things are gone damn it she has joined the migration out of town what about breakfast woman or am i to starve to death 
 um i i did not no why 
 well enough your gathering does honor to the deceased 
 hail constable how are you 
 these woods of yours sound a bit crowded what with all the witches ghouls and indians living there 
 must have been the redman a lenape indian lives in the western woods 
 who took the meat 
 then name one person who has seen him with their own eyes 
 many have 
 excuse me gentlemen but who has seen this horseman 
 this is not a time for frivolity katrina is it am i mistaken 
 if we could speak alone 
 i say if the horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people hes solid enough to feel this 
 i hit him square 
 you must have missed your mark 
 i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing 
 constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side 
 two days for murder 
 they spend two days in chains 
 never a shoe that size i would have remembered 
 you are the blacksmith ever shod a horse with a hoof this large 
 what the hell are you doing 
 well unless your name is baltus you should not worry over mine 
 we havent heard your name yet friend 
 excuse me miss they have a laugh at your expense 
 certainly not 
 when this cut was made this person was already dead this is not lady van tassel 
 what 
 no clotting or gathering of pus no healing at all 
 what of it 
 stains of blood 
 would you stay doctor i may need assistance 
 help yourself you pompous ass i will be in bed 
 you will stay at her side 
 it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves 
 you need rest 
 bring him 
 you need to sleep 
 bring young masbath here 
 he is dead you would be also if your wound had not somehow shut 
 brom bones 
 keep still constable you were halfdrowned when they found you 
 in time doctor soon as i finish 
 i do not care you are welcome to use my work area but i beg you return her to her resting place 
 the wounds are the same cauterized no chopping or halfmeasures either one stroke took the head have you seen doctor even the spinal bone sliced as smooth as butter 
 a diseased monster 
 he is a behemoth 
 the lenape he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time 
 what are you spying on 
 we must be a curious sight to him 
 this should have bled by the pint yet no blistering or scorched flesh how whatever weapon was used it cauterized somehow 
 what is that 
 no bleeding 
 to place it inside its coffin 
 why did you move the body doctor 
 i was afraid of this 
 i say is there any one person suspect in these acts 
 excuse me 
 an honor gentlemen in time i will need every detail of the three murderings you have had but for now i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be 
 climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find father that is the closest you ever come to god 
 you cannot do this i am a man of god 
 you are so upset now and yet you seemed in such good spirits last night 
 he may but not soon enough for you and not on your behalf 
 damn you sir god damn you to hell 
 wallowing quite literally in blood 
 they need guidance 
 wallowing in sin and lust 
 i am the lords voice in this town 
 it is only important what you are an adulterer 
 are you a deist is that it a free thinker who does not believe in divinity 
 oh far as i can tell a rumor does not travel alone for long here 
 no you will not run me out no one will believe a word of what you say 
 only if i repeat them outside this room and i will if i must out there for all to hear or you may speak as planned but you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures 
 does that look like an animal hanging 
 for poaching or would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost 
 then you should have left two days ago because i have men willing to help me today 
 your superiors are two days away 
 protest to my superiors if you like 
 i will not allow it i will not 
 i cannot proceed without examining the previous victims 
 it is sacrilege 
 the heads were not found severed the heads were not found at all 
 all i know is three are slain their heads found severed from their bodies 
 why not tell us what you have heard hmm how much have your superiors bothered to tell you 
 well that might be helpful 
 perhaps i could assist in finding them 
 master hardenbrook 
 damn damn damn 
 a fine idea 
 maybe you should take this 
 of course you want them it shall not take long wait here 
 may we look at them now 
 hmm see them 
 may i see them master hardenbrook 
 yes sir but do you have these 
 i have everything last testaments birth certificates death certificates deeds 
 do you have these persons wills 
 when a goblin leaps from the nether world others follow poltergeists of the air water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations 
 just a moment are you saying it is he 
 pardon me 
 taken taken by the headless horseman taken back to hell 
 excellent then you are excused till morning 
 i shall gladly 
 just so granted and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place bring him here to face our good justice will you do this for me 
 not for lack of trying 
 these methods of yours there has been no practical application 
 chosen me 
 there is a farming community upstate constable ten days journey north in the hudson highlands it is named sleepy hollow within a fortnight three persons have been murdered there each with their head lopped cleanly off the elders of the hollow have sent dispatches to me requesting assistance and now just this very moment i have chosen you 
 not liberalism equanimity 
 for one who calls himself a federalist your mouth reeks of republican liberalism 
 even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused often quite literally 
 very few if any 
 but how many innocents rot here and how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets 
 and with disrespect constable if jails and courts overflow it is testimony to success not failure 
 without disrespect look around you we overflow as do our courts 
 have they nothing to fear presently 
 our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence but if we were more often able to ensure justice after the fact then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement 
 must we again hear these heretical rantings 
 i could determine if he were dead before he went into the hudson 
 he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health 
 there are surgical ways of telling how he died by the water in his lungs 
 he drowned anyone could see 
 just a moment if i may it is possible this man was murdered 
 its not something people speak of openly she did not remarry 
 is that all you say look at her 
 the widow windsor 
 van ripper and his wife agreed to take him they have children and a good home and good land 
 tell me something what becomes of young masbath 
 no sir no if you ask me i say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass 
 more than enough actually i beg you no more please 
 master crane sir im glad we have time alone you have been told plenty about the horseman im certain 
 at times i do 
 no you listen you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards 
 listen to what you say 
 i know it 
 we are farmers here not lawyers or bankers or even constables every penny we earn comes from what we send down the hudson 
 are you saying i should be frightened is this a message passed on from clergyman steenwyck 
 not more than a year ago a mob hung a man for stealing a horse for stealing a horse and you dig up our dead 
 well so much for common sense 
 my talisman it will protect against the horseman if i show a brave face but i cannot run if i run in fear it is worthless 
 what is that you wear 
 believe 
 found the body this morning you do believe now dont you 
 he would not have gone into the western woods no sane man would 
 why would he flee this direction with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover 
 and now jonathan masbath 
 the van garretts died first a man and his son survived by a wife and two infants and the widow windsor was next 
 the militia 
 well constable are you aware to be honest you are not what we expected we sent for the militia 
 tired 
 how are you 
 i doubt thats the end 
 what now 
 take the reins 
 what can we do 
 i know hold on 
 lady van tassel 
 climb up 
 i cannot you should not worry van ripper and his wife will look after you they will you will be well cared for 
 take me with you theres nothing left for me here 
 this is farewell 
 you do not know all that has happened you cannot understand 
 why why are you like this 
 nothing to hell with this place and all the people here 
 wont you change your mind sir what can i say to convince you 
 i need time for thinking without you hanging on my coattails for a change 
 shes the one who controlled the horseman isnt she sir sir 
 things have become complicated katrina is at the mill ride ahead find her and bring her to meet me outside the church find her at all costs quickly 
 what now where is she 
 but sir what books where are they 
 fiction plays and novels baltus does not approve now come it may not be long before lady van tassel returns 
 what books 
 it is nothing she comes to read books so her father will not find her it is absolutely nothing 
 there are no other doors this is as far as she could have gone 
 no they are all missing 
 something i really wish i had not seen never mind it did you find the victims loan agreements 
 what was she doing 
 lady van tassel 
 i was getting worried who was it 
 there are none for magistrate philipse either paasch james pieter thomas pos william 
 there is no masbath here my fathers loan papers are missing 
 yes i rode with him on payment days 
 did your father take a loan 
 baltus van tassel 
 often in such cases property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to and who in this town is owed a great many debts 
 what does it mean 
 intestate your farm all the farms they belong to no one 
 in test what 
 no one yet far as i can tell it has gone intestate 
 but if the farm is not mine who stole it away 
 only the heirs were killed proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment 
 yes 
 and it now belongs to you according to baltus i heard him say it 
 my father had farm land it was the only thing we owned of any value 
 to discover what might have been taken from those who died it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place 
 what good is this 
 because i serve a fine purpose alive it is perfection for our murderer if i return to new york city with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul we must uncover the reason these victims were targeted what was taken from them other than their lives who benefits by their deaths 
 if someone has the horsemans skull if they control the horseman then why havent they sent him for your head yet 
 business best hidden is hidden best at night 
 all i saw was their lantern 
 man or woman 
 someone left last night looked like they headed to the square but i lost them in the forest 
 why this tree 
 we should go 
 must be some sort of gateway but why this place 
 stay back 
 what is it 
 good questions deserving answers of which we are in short supply 
 then who murdered the old crone and why 
 true enough 
 well im one of the few people who likes you 
 you grow sharper by the minute little man it boggles my mind but i begin to prefer your company over all others 
 if the crones wound bled hard that means she was not killed by the hessian someone only tried to make it look that way 
 let loose his silent shrieking who knows till we work at it i admit not being anxious to find out he who holds the horsemans desire will guide his reaping hand whatever the horsemans desire is other than extinguishing lives 
 what does it mean climb down to the horsemans soulless place 
 we are far from the hollow loath to say it better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning 
 should we go back 
 we should not go much further in this murk 
 how could something named the tree of the dead fail to draw attention 
 follow the indian trail to where the sun dies to the tree of the dead maybe we passed it by 
 what happened 
 we are leaving 
 no crickets or cicadas calling no bird songs 
 i hear nothing 
 listen 
 what is it 
 witches do not exist however 
 father said witches live there 
 if the western woods are truly the devils glen we will see for ourselves 
 now hold the bowl steady back to business 
 thank you 
 i have others all i need is this 
 no i couldnt 
 yes i suppose it is keep it 
 its spectacular 
 not for eating i assure you watch here 
 what kind of nuts 
 are you familiar with magnets 
 look again 
 the western woods 
 out there what do you see 
 its payment day loan monies are given to baltus the last day each month almost everyone borrows for tools or to hire workers 
 what is it 
 up 
 where are we going 
 his teeth someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth the lenape could not have done that for himself someone out there cared for him 
 how could he 
 the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth 
 we must discover it the reason the murderer chose these persons 
 im sure i dont know 
 what is the common thread between these victims 
 i did not ask you to did i 
 young masbath i am sorry for your loss it is a great and sad tragedy however i cannot be the one to look after you now 
 i deserve to help you dont you see how much this means my father he he was a good man 
 i manage fine alone 
 whatever you still need a second to tend to your things 
 i am not here for revenge i am here to bring justice 
 we have no choice 
 i i cant do this 
 the blades will carry us to the ground face front and wait for me 
 no get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump 
 quickly close it 
 keep climbing i will follow 
 ichabod 
 his horse 
 what was that 
 he moves too fast 
 the church 
 i do not know away 
 where are we going 
 speak the words constable what is stopping you what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality 
 katrina 
 call me a liar then and a murderess say it out and out 
 the name van tassel is blackened you share that name 
 if you think i am behind this say it 
 what would you have me believe 
 yes i have seen that and i told you why i hid them 
 the loans give the land to your father it does not matter survivors are still on their farms they could be thrown off tomorrow a year from now 
 i have not been able to face him yet 
 what did he say katrina 
 he did not do these things if you knew him you would realize 
 and what did he say 
 when when you spoke fathers name along with accusations i could not believe it i had to hide these at least till i could confront him myself 
 it was you there 
 i have been reading your journal im sorry i found it too fascinating to resist i rode to catch up with you at the notary out of curiosity before i found you though i overheard what you were said 
 come with me 
 what is so urgent 
 im drawing bad blood from the wound 
 what what are you doing 
 yes i did notice that thank you 
 the skull is gone 
 why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside 
 he he tries to take the heads they will not pass 
 my god what has happened 
 just keep where you are 
 what are you doing 
 what did you say 
 blood 
 but i am not alone am i i only wished to see what you were up to and to thank you 
 a woman should not be out alone in these woods 
 i apologize if i worried you 
 katrina why do you follow 
 it is only me 
 i i do not know i no longer know what i think or what i feel 
 if you want me to go i will do you want me to leave 
 memories have come back i had them forgotten and wish i could forget them again but they are here now lord how i hate this place 
 she died her lungs were diseased two years ago what is this about 
 what happened to your mother is she still alive 
 no but why do you ask that 
 she is not your birth mother is she 
 what 
 lady van tassel she is your stepmother isnt she she bears so little resemblance 
 what has happened 
 no actually you were not every word you spoke had truth in it 
 the things i said to you before i was wrong to say them 
 what troubles you 
 allow me some time i have spent every hour in the company of others i need to be alone 
 if it had been surgery on a living person done to save that persons life you would not question it not for a moment so let me be the first to tell you dear girl on the other side of these sheltering mountains a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours and someday no matter how much you fear it that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber 
 you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it cant you see you will bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it 
 but why tell me why 
 to avenge his father and the others 
 take a lesson from young masbaths desires ichabod crane he follows with you to avenge his fathers death that i understand but what do you want 
 i have no solution for its meaning yet but i could not just ignore it 
 what is it then scientific method how can any of this matter in the slightest 
 it was not butchery 
 and this gives worth to butchery 
 there was no blind stabbing this singular thrust found its target omnipotently as if the horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother 
 must i hear this 
 the child she carried was eight months grown at least near to birthing the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly 
 what are you on about 
 you are not regarding it in full the widow windsor had been run through by a sword i followed the bloodless wound a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes 
 i have misjudged you i think i did not imagine you were so cruel 
 no stone may be left unturned it may appear harsh 
 why would you do such a thing 
 wont they still have that justice or was it a vain promise 
 they have done nothing of the sort 
 people have put their trust in you 
 if these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am i 
 you promised justice 
 that would be a pity those words might show you something you have never seen before 
 very well but it will only sit gathering dust 
 i insist that you have it 
 thank you no here 
 then i also have a gift for you true magic which even you will not be able to deny 
 if you want but 
 oh you are hopeless may i keep it at least 
 dont you see why look closely a moment put your intellect aside cant you see what is inexplicable 
 yes but listen the illusion is easily explained the eye retains each image till they combine and yet some would call this toy magic 
 you made this and the drawings 
 he only appears to be inside the cage the point being 
 yes he does may i try 
 here it is a bird on one side his cage on the other now stare at it the bird seems to be in his cage 
 it would be interesting to find out 
 i have had them since childhood i cannot remember what from 
 these scars how did you get them 
 i um i have something to show you if you have a moment 
 you pay great attention to small things i hide these as i hide all my books father would not approve lest it were the bible 
 may i ask why do you cover your book that way 
 you do not disturb me please stay having trouble sleeping 
 you are funny 
 poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions 
 really then what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom or even in a teardrop 
 there is no such thing as magic 
 to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black 
 are you so superstitious 
 not all think it is the horseman many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer offering death as tribute and still others believe none of it 
 extra ordinary yes but first you tell me about the headless horseman 
 i have read a great deal about your new york city do be a dear and tell me all about it sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life 
 which may explain his temperament to have asked twice means the answer was no at least once 
 he has proposed to me twice 
 the massive fellow brom for someone you call friend he misplaces a good portion of jealousy 
 my suitor 
 perhaps it is because your suitors hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat 
 is it me or are you this nervous around all women 
 it might have been more might have been positively grand talk 
 small talk 
 other people 
 excuse me i should apologize i um i have no great love of 
 well i intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend brom van brunt but it seems i have made matters worse i will leave you to your business 
 feel free to form your own opinion though it appears you already have 
 you are horribly oldfashioned arent you 
 do you often make a habit of sitting on strange mens beds 
 did they tell it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone according to the elders an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken and spells cast then still linger to this day 
 i i am looking for baltus van tassel 
 forgive me i didnt know 
 yes yes i think i will 
 let her go 
 you cannot kill what is already dead 
 what 
 i know you saw me 
 it is fine now i must 
 look closer do you have anything to clean it with 
 it appears well it has already clotted 
 very little i must be going 
 she has taken the last of our grain to be milled you do have a background in the medical arts dont you constable 
 where 
 no she has gone out 
 excuse me lady van tassel katrina is not in her room 
 as my husband says a wife should be always like an echo and at the same time quite unlike an echo like an echo she should speak only when spoken to and unlike an echo should never try to have the last word or at least that is what he believes 
 do you know i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here 
 use caution 
 yes actually 
 returning to the western woods 
 it is a prime tenet of science philipse that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical 
 you said yourself what mere man could have downed the belltower 
 yes here 
 van ripper do you have a gun 
 turn around now 
 what did you say 
 van ripper turn the coach about 
 i didnt see none 
 there was not much blood was there 
 to the best of your recollection where did the open wound fall 
 here in front of this oak facing north horrible 
 i can show exactly 
 van ripper can you show where the body lay 
 close your mouth keep silent 
 what what are you doing 
 you want to see into the nether world i can show you whatever you see do not move or speak i will hold him 
 can you help 
 sit 
 the horseman yes 
 i hear him he rides to the hollow and back 
 leave me you are not welcome here 
 the lenape who lived in these woods do you know him the redman i should tell you he has been murdered 
 in a way yes 
 you are from the hollow 
 pardon you did not answer when i knocked are we intruding 
 this whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon but i am not going to kill you not me 
 no one will believe your lies whore 
 imagine my surprise finding him on a liason with a common servant a girl who had apparently become his secret love 
 he saw me thrown saw the horseman looming over me as i fled things i wanted him to see but as long as i govern the horseman he cannot harm me baltus did not stay enough to see that he ran as a coward unfettered by my fate 
 father saw you die 
 he rides tonight 
 am i or are you and young masbath dead along with me 
 you you are alive 
 doctor he is awake 
 lay still ichabod do not move 
 she has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession do you know what confession is all that is left for you now is to pray for her soul

 yes maam i like a fried chicken leg 
 yeah i guess 
 if i aint too stove up i aint like you im old and give out im proud of ye 
 can we play ever saturday 
 i wadnt thinkin about nothin else just like you told me id do 
 it was fun anyhow 
 no sir 
 it dont matter to me about us losin does it to you 
 you are strong though you let me make them touchdowns so id feel good my daddy used to do that kind of thing 
 them boys was tryin to pull me down pretty hard 
 i know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing em over to me 
 we are liable to win if we keep this up for somebody like you you sure run fast 
 i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got ahold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you i seen you over there follerin me 
 way to go karl we got a touchdown that was a good lateral man that was just like the wishbone 
 yessir 
 we will be on teams me and you 
 yeah 
 you will for sure 
 i will play ball with ye i reckon if neither one of us is no count it wont make no difference 
 is that right 
 bill cox is goin to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin up shop early 
 make believin always made me feel good too from time to time 
 i feel sad about karen cross too i just make like to myself she loves me i know better though it just feels good to me when i imagine it 
 i dont reckon i know i aint found no way yet and im three or four times as old as you might be thats just the way folks is 
 seems like doyles wormed his way back in mama said hes stayin over tonight and hes talkin about movin in for good we aint ever gonna be happy we will always be nervous wont we karl 
 readin on this book on how to work carpentry i aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times i have always been partial to wood buildins and cabinets and whatnot these drawins they got here dont make no sense to me so far you seem like yore tails adraggin a might you got somethin wrong with ye 
 what you readin 
 i reckon 
 she said shed see me later thats kinda good right 
 yes sir i reckon it does 
 bible says the same thing about killin others too 
 i have studied about it the bible says not to or you end up goin to hades some folks calls it hell i call it hades 
 i didnt mean to say anything bad about you i know you are good you didnt mean no harm did you ever think about killin yourself on purpose like my daddy did 
 hits been hard thinkin about it they aint a day goes by i dont think about it i kindly have a picture of it up in my head that i see hit makes me sad too i have bad thoughts on it i wished they was somethin i could of did too shouldnt no bad things happen to childern all the ol bad things ort to be saved up for folks thats growed up the way i see it i shouldnt of told you about that a boy ort not hear about such things it just kindly come out 
 that makes me feel real sad couldnt you have done somethin karl i would have i wish i would of had him hed be here right now livin 
 i wadnt but six or eight i reckon i didnt know what to do i didnt know how to care for no baby mama and daddy didnt want him they learned me to do what they told me to these days i figure it might of been best to give him right back to the good lord right off the bat anyhow 
 that dont seem right it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother 
 i heared it cryin a little through that box 
 it was still alive when you buried it 
 i didnt feel right about doin that i takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there that seemed more proper to me i reckon 
 you threw it in a trash barrel 
 a little ol boy 
 a boy or girl 
 yes sir right then it was 
 it was alive 
 my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin in it i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see cause they was a noise and somethin movin in it hit was bloodylike around that towel hit was a little ol bitty baby no bigger than a squirrel 
 so it died when it come out 
 hit was borned a little too early on my mother and father made hit come too early some way or other i reckon they changed their mind about havin anothern i was about six or eight year old then and they didnt care too much for me so i reckon they didnt need somethin else to worry em with 
 why 
 yeah 
 why not it died 
 i had one there for little bit hit didnt get old enough to play with 
 cause its fun it dont matter if you aint no good it takes your mind off of everything else while you are doin it when you run real fast tryin to make a touchdown you dont think about anything else i aint no good but my daddy always said he was proud of me when i threw a ball or ran with it did you have any brothers and sisters growin up to play with 
 naw 
 and then some people you dont like right off its funny you know why i want you to play ball with me 
 i dont reckon i know 
 you dont seem like a daddy you seem like a brother wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you dont even know em like what happened with me and you 
 he aint no count 
 i kind of like you tellin me what to do and not to do just like my daddy i didnt mind him tellin me i hate doyle to tell me what to do mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us that we cant leave him or he will try and hurt her 
 you ort not to pull on yourself that away 
 i didnt know till here while back a year or two ago when i spent the night with ronnie smart one time he said just tug on your peter and think about your mama i tried it but i felt funny thinkin about my mama so i switched over to thinkin about his mama and then what he told me would happen happened it sure tingles dont it 
 yes sir you ort not know that language 
 oh jackin off 
 pull on your works your privates 
 what do you mean 
 thats real good you ort not to if ye aint married to somebody bible tells you that much hit tells some things that dont seem right too i reckon i guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can though you dont touch yourself do you 
 and i dont try to touch her you know in a bad way foolin around sex and all 
 naw 
 just cause im not rich dont mean i dont love her 
 they ort to you are a good boy 
 i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they are home reckon why they dont like me 
 i bet he will i got a little money if he dont i will get em for ye 
 i aint got no money to get em with but i bet vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store 
 if you want me to 
 would you go see her with me i kind of thought i might take her some flowers like that woman done you 
 yeah i recollect it 
 you know that girl i told you about the one i love 
 all right then 
 i was wantin to ask you somethin 
 hit was right thoughty of her 
 yeah me too that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers 
 yeah i reckon they did hit like to tore me up when i read about that pore little cripple boy 
 boy folks sure had it rough back a long time ago didnt they 
 all right then 
 im gettin tired of readin for a while 
 yeah

 i dont see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides its made out of 
 i reckon if you want me to i got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some 
 will you stay here with us for a long time 
 he ort not to talk that away to you neither he aint no count hes mean to you and your mama yore mama and that feller thats carryin me to get somethin deats gonna be back here directly 
 well i hate him 
 you ort not to talk that way you are just a boy 
 id like to kill that son of a bitch i hate him 
 its okay if you are lookin out for yourself if its selfdefense was it selfdefense 
 i growed up and got taught it aint right to kill nobody 
 maybe they needed it 
 i thought they was 
 were they bad people 
 two people 
 who did you kill 
 yeah i did 
 cause he didnt have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to thats what the letter said he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs i thought he took care of us fine karl did you really kill somebody 
 why did he do that reckon 
 it aint the truth he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose 
 yeah i remember you atellin me that 
 karl you know when i said daddy got hit by a train 
 she says its for the times when hes good to her shes lonely since daddy died she said sometimes she dont know why he threatened to kill her if she ever left him my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama vaughan hes real good to mama vaughan that you met but hes not able to do anything to doyle hes funny you know not funny ha ha funny queer he likes to go with men instead of women that makes him not to be able to fight too good he sure is nice though hes from st louis people who are queer can get along better in a big town he got transferred here to work but mama said the real reason he left is cause his daddy hated him for bein the way he is i wish he liked to go with women id rather him be mamas boyfriend than doyle 
 how come her to keep bein girlfriends and all with him if hes mean to her 
 i have had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here my mamas real good but i wish i had both of em when we went to memphis one time in the car it was rainin so hard we couldnt see the road but i wadnt scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin nothin could happen to us i feel that way about mama now mama has a boyfriend now his name is doyle hargraves he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin he still dont help mama out with any money though he aint no good hes mean to her he dont like me at all mama says its because hes jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him he stays with us all night sometimes but hes got his own house somebody told me its so he can still have other girlfriends i like it on the nights when he aint at our house im not so nervous then 
 you dont need to know all of that you are just a boy you need to think about good thoughts while you are still a boy they will be plenty of time for the other

 i aint astayin i need to ast you fer a favor 
 karl what are you doing here come in 
 i aint read em yet except two or three of em i cant understand a lot of what i try to read my mind hit wonders off to somethin else when i try to read 
 i think karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually you should see all the books he has he must read constantly 
 before that i was thinkin itd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry 
 oh how about before that 
 i was thinkin i could use me another helpin of these potaters 
 thats what i thought i hope i havent offended you in any way you seem like a thinker you seem to always be in deep thought tell me something what are you thinking right now 
 i wouldnt never hurt them 
 anyway its hard to live gay thats the right way to say it in a small town like this i have wanted to leave many times but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we wont go into have kept me from it anyway im rambling if you are going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it wont be easy doyle is a monster not just a closed minded redneck but a monster a dangerous person i have told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy maybe even kill one of them i see it in his eyes im very in tune maybe even psychic doyle will make your life hell you are a perfect target when i first saw you i was afraid of you not really afraid i guess just taken aback but also i felt a real sensitive feeling from you and for some reason frank has adopted you much like a stray animal im sorry i didnt mean it like that in a good way anyway i just want you to know what you are in for i have a good feeling about you you are good for frank maybe its that he can have an adult friend on a childs level im sorry i didnt mean it in a bad way theres one more thing its none of my business why you were in the state hospital everyone has something in their past maybe you tried suicide maybe you did something terrible but what i see before me is a gentle simple man all i want you to promise me is that you are capable of being around linda and frank you know you would never hurt them under any circumstances would you 
 i have heard it said that way 
 well thats a very offensive way to put it you shouldnt say that you were taught that werent you 
 not funny ha ha funny queer 
 homosexual i like men sexually 
 i reckon not 
 okay karl the reason i brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind i guess i will put it right out on the table where do i start linda and frank are very important to me they are like family my own family was never like family they are horrible people as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him now i just dont care you see you and i are a lot alike strange as that may seem i mean not physically or even mentally really just well maybe emotionally or actually the hand we have been dealt in life we are different people see us as being different anyway you are well you have your affliction or whatever and i well mines not as easy to see im just going to say it im gay does that surprise you that im gay you know what being gay is dont you 
 okay i will come by mr coxs and get you at noon 
 i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin or nother at noontime tomorrow bill cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters but i reckon he can lay off doin it tomorrow 
 i mean tomorrow or the next day 
 i done et just a little bit ago 
 listen before you get very used to staying here i think you and i need to talk about a few things can i take you to lunch 
 quite a spell i reckon 
 how long have you been standing here 
 naw i aint 
 did you knock on the door yet 
 that boy wants me to 
 so you are really going to stay here 
 yes sir 
 not really to speak of 
 do you have family here 
 i reckon mr woolridge got me hired on to work for bill coxs outfit 
 is that right are you going to be staying here long 
 they turned me loose from the state hospital 
 why are you here now 
 whats that you say 
 what brings you back 
 is horned and raised here up till is twelve year old 
 its been here seventeen years did you live here before or something 
 naw i dont believe you have i dont reckon i never been in here this store didnt used to be here 
 i dont think i have ever seen you before 
 thats very sweet of you vaughan we care about you too dont we yall 
 listen everybody i know this may sound corny i have had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional but im going to say it anyway it just came over me in a rush i want you all to know that i care about each and every one of you at this table 
 im sorry 
 vaughan dont get pushy 
 karl maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner its a nice night 
 hey karl you know what melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february isnt that somethin 
 good i havent decided yet if im a good cook 
 karl is a guy guy 
 i dont think he sees you as a guy guy 
 what about me 
 hes retardeds all you know hes always after a father figure and lord knows doyle aint a good one with his mean ass 
 hes been in the state hospital a long time something must be wrong with him 
 franks just crazy about him he likes the way he talks he helped him carry home the clean laundry 
 are you sure its safe to let him around that guy 
 i know 
 he just got out of the state hospital 
 can i help you sir 
 frank dont talk that way whos that strange lookin man behind you did he follow you in here 
 why wont he talk to women 
 i thought youd be happy to leave 
 no we have to get this story 
 lets just go marsha 
 yeah 
 do you smell shit 
 hey you are the one that wanted to major in journalism anyhow wasnt the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it it was twentyfive years ago he probably doesnt even remember it 
 in a few minutes we are gonna be in a room with a killer that doesnt bother you 
 i dont know why you are so weirded out this is not san quentin its just a nuthouse most of these people dont even know where they are they are not gonna hurt you 
 as much as anybody else is i guess yall have a good rest of the day now 
 will he be supervised 
 wherever he wants to i think hes going back to millsburg where hes from its just about twenty miles from here 
 where will he go 
 i hope the best for you miss dwiggins with your school and your paper and all 
 i didnt mean that 
 we have got some paperwork to take care of pretty soon dont worry you wont run into him in the parking lot 
 is he leaving right this minute 
 homicidal signs oh we are gonna change the light in here for karl i hope you can see to write 
 signs 
 hes free his times up thats the rules hes been treated and reevaluated he doesnt show any signs any more 
 can i ask you a question if hes so troubled why are you letting him out what if he does it again it happens all the time 
 its the best you are gonna get im sorry 
 how am i going to conduct an interview if i cant ask him any questions 
 but heres the thing he will only talk to you he doesnt want you to ask him anything and you shouldnt stare at him 
 one of his daddys bible lessons i imagine yall pull up a chair i will go out and talk to him 
 thats really strange what does it mean 
 i dont think so just period i think she told him god gave them the ugliest creation he could think of karl has an entire book a notebook on every page it says franklin chapter N verse number N he wrote that a few years ago after hed learned to write his fathers name was franklin 
 before they were married 
 his mother told him that he was their punishment hers and his fathers from god for having sex 
 i knew he slept in a toolshed 
 you see karl growing up only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it he couldnt really read but well neither could his mother but his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said and she made sure karl knew you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed right 
 melvin go get karl and take him down to the old classroom 
 cant you talk to him maybe talk him into it im a real good interviewer just get me in the room with him 
 well what do we do we drove all the way out here 
 i dont know what to tell you im sorry i made myself pretty clear i thought he probably got busy and wasnt thinking i know how that is i used to teach shop and eighth grade science 
 the other thing is i told your boss on the phone to send a man karl wont talk to women 
 no thank you 
 karls real sensitive about having his picture made he wouldnt even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage melvin would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes you girls want some coffee 
 well yeah its for the school newspaper but it has pictures i mean its a regular paper you know 
 i think there must have been a little mix up i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is there couldnt be any pictures its sposed to be just a little story or article or something isnt that right 
 yes sir 
 yall have a seat is this all of you 
 nice to meet you im marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans shes here to take the pictures 
 my names jerry woolridge 
 i think everybody at the store knows that already they always talk about it maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you aint allowed over at the first baptist church no more 
 yes 
 you mean about yall bein together in that way 
 well a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors unfortunately i have to keep certain parts of my life private 
 why 
 also melinda please dont tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight okay 
 no wonder its such a screwedup place 
 i once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the united states have at least one relative who has lived in brooklyn at one time or another 
 like me too 
 actually im his father 
 and what are you his chaperone 
 threes a crowd yes im aware of that but i have to keep an eye on mr benjamin wherever he goes to make sure he doesnt get himself into trouble 
 ahhah i see a cozy dinner but arent threesomes a little awkward how does the phrase go 
 i wouldnt actually call it a party its more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday the guest list is quite restricted so far theres mr benjamin and myself if you accept that would make three of us 
 and how many people will be attending this birthday party 
 its my birthday 
 and whats the occasion of this celebration 
 an invitation 
 good then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you 
 no at least i dont think i am 
 perhaps i should rephrase the question what i mean to say is are you married or seriously involved with a significant other 
 what 
 wonderful when your next book is published maybe you could come into the store and do a signing im sure we could get a lot of people to show up 
 its coming along at the rate hes going he will have a story finished by the end of the summer 
 fortyone pages 
 okay i will read it tonight and call you tomorrow it doesnt seem to be too long 
 uh actually it might be better if you read the story first call me when you are finished okay 
 i get off for lunch in ten minutes can i treat you to a hamburger 
 good i hope you like it it was a long time in coming 
 id love to 
 i finished my story i thought you might want to take a look at it 
 almost done a week or ten days and i will be there 
 yeah well i have sort of been out of commission hows melville 
 its been a while i thought maybe youd be in touch 
 i will tell you all about it but not here 
 what happened 
 it looks worse than it is im okay 
 jesus what happened to you 
 which explains why this hasnt been the easiest summer of my life 
 not an easy book 
 thats the subject of my last chapter 
 melville huh its been a while 
 of course i fool around but not so much when it comes to my work its true have you ever read pierre or the ambiguities 
 wow you dont fool around do you 
 visions of utopia in nineteenthcentury american fiction 
 what else of course what else and what are you writing about for your thesis 
 american literature what else 
 your dissertation what subject do you study 
 its just a summer job something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation 
 and the bookstore have you been working there long 
 just like me 
 muncie indiana he and my mother met as students but im from brooklyn my sisters and i were all born and bred right here 
 and your father is he from new york 
 until she was twelve she moved here in fortynine 
 so your mother grew up in shanghai 
 i keep waiting for the next novel to come out anything in the works 
 i confess 
 i thought i recognized you you are paul benjamin the writer arent you 
 better make it charge 
 will that be cash or charge 
 thanks i knew youd understand 
 uh sure sol anything you say instead of saying one corned beef sandwich and then another corned beef sandwich i will say two corned beef sandwiches 
 its simpler thats what it makes things go faster 
 whats the difference 
 next time when you want two corned beef sandwiches say two corned beef sandwiches when you want two ginger ales say two ginger ales 
 whats that sol 
 do me a favor will you 
 for me i will have the same thing 
 what about for you 
 huh 
 and what about for you 
 uh my friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale 
 what will it be auggie 
 exactly life just wouldnt be worth living would it 
 shit if you cant share your secrets with your friends what kind of friend are you 
 i mean its a good story 
 what do you mean 
 yes i suppose i do 
 and now you have got your christmas story dont you 
 i wouldnt say that but at least you have put the camera to good use 
 anything for art eh paul 
 you made her happy and the camera was stolen anyway its not as if the person you took it from really owned it 
 i lied to her and then i stole from her i dont see how you can call that a good deed 
 it was a good deed auggie it was a nice thing you did for her 
 i guess so i never thought of it that way 
 which means that she spent her last christmas with you 
 yeah probably 
 she probably died 
 once about three or four months later i felt so bad about stealing the camera i hadnt even used it yet i finally made up my mind to return it but granny ethel wasnt there anymore someone else had moved into the apartment and he couldnt tell me where she was 
 did you ever go back to see her 
 okay so this is the story of how it happened okay it was the summer of seventysix back when i first started working for vinnie the summer of the bicentennial a kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store hes standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt it was crowded around the counter just then so i didnt see him at first 
 every word 
 okay you remember how you once asked me how i started taking pictures well this is the story of how i got my first camera as a matter of fact its the only camera i have ever had are you following me so far 
 im all ears 
 ready any time you are 
 so are we ready 
 you got it 
 i have to pee if the waiter comes order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale okay 
 take over the register while im gone okay jimmy 
 it doesnt have to be true it just has to be good 
 good of course are you kidding i will tell you what buy me lunch my friend and i will tell you the best christmas story you ever heard hows that and i guarantee every word of it is true 
 anything good 
 christmas stories sure i know a ton of em 
 yeah great the problem is i have four days to come up with something and i dont have a single idea you know anything about christmas stories 
 thats a feather in your cap man the paper of record 
 fine or it was until a couple of days ago a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story they want to publish it on christmas day 
 ahhah 
 yeah i know but im trying to cut down somebodys worried about my health 
 you usually get two 
 uh better make it one 
 two right

 its tommys the sucker owed me a favor 
 nice machine auggie whered you find it 
 nothing much he said his socks and underpants were dirty and would we mind driving up with his things fucking kids huh they take you for granted every time 
 so what did he say when he called 
 or didnt theres no way of knowing is there 
 that could be a good sign though it could mean that he got away 
 i spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago but she hasnt heard from him either its beginning to get a little scary 
 not a peep 
 you havent heard from rashid have you 
 for once in my life i managed to keep my mouth shut theres something to be said for that i suppose 
 fuckus my assus they did some number on you 
 no the uh the bobbsey twins lit out when they heard the sirens but at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull assaultus interruptus 
 cops you mean they nabbed those cruds 
 it could have been worse if the cops hadnt come i might not be standing here now 
 fuck you kid 
 its written all over you like a neon sign now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better 
 you are right i just wasnt sure you knew 
 no hes not you are 
 hes crazy 
 dont be an ass auggie hes trying to make it up to you cant you see that 
 if hes got something to tell me why dont he tell it to me himself 
 hes got something to tell you auggie 
 yeah well im sorry too it took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks and now im broke i cant hardly pay for this beer not to speak of having my credibility destroyed do you understand what im saying my credibility so yeah im sorry too about as sorry as i have ever been in my whole fucking life 
 the kids sorry auggie 
 hey kid you interested in a job i just got word from your employment agency that you are looking for a position in retail sales 
 im thinking about the kid im sure hed do a good job for you 
 help hmm its possible what did you have in mind 
 hey auggie i have just been thinking you wouldnt need some help around the store would you some summer help while vinnies gone 
 how old kid 
 its his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little 
 so what brings you to a dive like this 
 this is april lee auggie april say hello to auggie wren 
 hey man good to see you 
 its ellen look at her look at my sweet darling 
 yeah there she is shes in quite a few from that year she must have been on her way to work 
 yeah thats what id recommend you know how it is tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow time creeps on its petty pace 
 slow down huh 
 they are all the same but each one is different from every other one you have got your bright mornings and your dark mornings you have got your summer light and your autumn light you have got your weekdays and your weekends you have got your people in overcoats and galoshes and you have got your people in shorts and tshirts sometimes the same people sometimes different ones and sometimes the different ones become the same and the same ones disappear the earth revolves around the sun and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle 
 but they are all the same 
 i mean you are going too fast you are hardly even looking at the pictures 
 what do you mean 
 you will never get it if you dont slow down my friend 
 its kind of overwhelming 
 i dont know it just came to me its my corner after all its just one little part of the world but things happen there too just like everywhere else its a record of my little spot 
 amazing im not sure i get it though i mean how did you ever come up with the idea to do this this project 
 its my project what youd call my lifes work 
 i have never seen anything like it 
 thats right more than four thousand pictures of the same place the corner of N rd street and seventh avenue at eight oclock in the morning four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather thats why i can never take a vacation i have got to be in my spot every morning every morning in the same spot at the same time 
 they are all the same 
 it can be arranged seeing as how i have read your books i dont see why i shouldnt share my pictures with you it would be an honor 
 id like to see your pictures some day 
 well lets not exaggerate i take pictures you line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter no need to mess around with all that artisto crap 
 a photographer 
 taking pictures its a long story id need two or three drinks to get through that one 
 howd you get started 
 thats what people see but that aint necessarily what i am 
 so you are not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter 
 i guess you could call it a hobby it doesnt take me more than about five minutes a day to do it but i do it every day rain or shine sleet or snow sort of like the postman sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job and my job is just a way to support my hobby 
 i didnt know you took pictures 
 its mine all right i have owned that little sucker for a long time 
 its yours 
 yeah i did 
 looks like someone forgot a camera 
 no problem its not as though im rushing off to the opera or anything 
 do you think i could buy some before you leave 
 you run out of schimmelpennincks

 i wouldnt think of it see you around fellas 
 seven eightyfive out of twenty take care of yourself now and dont do anything i wouldnt do

 that i wasnt bullshitting you sweetheart at least you will know i have been telling the truth 
 yeah like what 
 relax okay you dont have to do anything just go in there and pretend it wont kill you to do a little favor like that besides you might even learn something

 good old frank and how is fat mr grease monkey these days 
 then why do you think i married frank i was already pregnant and i didnt have much time say what you like but at least he gave my kid a name 
 you are conning me sweetheart i aint responsible for no baby 
 and thats how felicity came into the picture during one of those two seconds 
 a couple of moments i will grant you that a second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity 
 it fizzled baby thats the way it goes but we had our times didnt we it wasnt all bad 
 you werent so lukewarm yourself at least at first 
 it was over with bill before you ever came home maybe you dont remember it now but you were pretty hot to see me back then 
 yeah well i lost my pen by the time i got a new one i was clean out of paper 
 you didnt write to me for more than a year what was i supposed to think 
 thats what you told me when i shoplifted that necklace for you you remember baby dont you the judge gave me a choice either go to the can or enlist so instead of going to college i wind up in the navy for four years i watch men lose their arms and legs i nearly get my head blown off and you sweet ruby mcnutt you run off and marry that asshole bill 
 why would i lie to you auggie you think it was easy to come here and walk into this place why would i do it if i didnt have to 
 you have suckered me before darling remember why should i believe you now 
 i dont know who else to turn to auggie 
 i know what it means that still dont make it a good name 
 it means happiness 
 stop it already just stop all this crap right now was that your idea to call her felicity 
 her name is felicity and she just turned eighteen she ran away from pittsburgh last year and now shes living in some shithole here in brooklyn with a guy named chico strung out on crack four months pregnant i cant bear to think about that baby our grandchild auggie just think of it our grandchild 
 our daughter is that what you said our daughter i mean you might have a daughter but i sure as hell dont and even if i did which i dont she wouldnt be our daughter 
 dont rush me okay you are jumping to conclusions before i have even said anything and besides its not for me its for our daughter 
 help huh and i dont suppose this help has anything to do with money does it 
 like what you are doing im not going to eat you up i need your help and if you keep staring at me like that i might start screaming 
 like what 
 dont look at me like that auggie it gives me the creeps 
 all right sugar whats on your mind 
 you heard her pipsqueak the lady and i have private business to discuss go outside and stand in front of the door if anyone tries to come in tell em we are closed you got that 
 this is private auggie just between you and i 
 talk away lady of my dreams im all ears 
 i have got something to talk to you about and the least you can do is listen you owe me that much i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you and im not going until you have heard me out 
 at least i have stayed true to myself which is more than i can say about some people 
 you always were a sonofabitch werent you a little weasel with a quick dirty mouth 
 and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook 
 i dont want to talk about it if you really want to know i lost it and im not sorry i did that eye was cursed auggie and it never gave me nothing but grief 
 no im not i look like shit and so do you ruby you look just awful whats with the patch anyway whatd you do with that old blue marble hock it for a bottle of gin

 i have got to get moving terry will bust my chops if im late see you in september auggie 
 they come in they go out i have got it planned to the last detail 
 suit yourself but dont keep the boxes around here long 
 its the law thats buying thats whats so beautiful about it i mean when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail 
 no thanks i dont care what you do but just make sure you dont get caught okay the last i heard it was still illegal to sell cuban cigars in this country 
 its all set my guy in miami said hed have them within the next few weeks are you sure you dont want to go in with me five thousand dollars outlay a guaranteed tenthousanddollar return a consortium of court street lawyers and judges they are just drooling to get their lips around some genuine cuban cigars 
 speaking of which are you still going ahead with that deal on the montecristos 
 tobacco today sex tomorrow in three or four years it will probably be against the law to smile at strangers 
 they catch you smoking tobacco they will stand you up against a wall and shoot you 
 enjoy it while you can vin pretty soon they are going to legislate us out of business anyway 
 i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do the fuckers are going to kill me one day 
 i try not to anyway its better for your health i mean look at you vincent you are the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on long island you are the guy with the white shoes and the white caddy and the white shag carpet but you have had two heart attacks and im still waiting for my first 
 you dont take anything seriously do you 
 she made a play for me after i got back but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration every time we got into a clinch id start thinking about that hole in her head that empty socket with the glass eye in it an eye that couldnt see an eye that couldnt shed any tears the minute i started thinking about it mr johnson would get all soft and small and i cant see getting married if mr johnson isnt going to be in tiptop shape 
 lovely 
 she upped and married some other cat after i joined the navy by the time i got my discharge though she was divorced her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel 
 sounds like another one of your stories to me 
 ruby mcnutt my one true love 
 yeah i know to that girl who moved to pittsburgh 
 i almost got married once 
 shit you should have been married to someone by now you know settled down somewhere with a kid or two a nice steady job 
 i dont know maybe because i love you so much boss 
 its pretty crazy dont you think i mean a smart guy like you what do you want to hang on to a deadend job like this for 
 i dont know thirteen fourteen years something like that 
 how long you been working for me auggie 
 no problem vinnie everythings under control i could run this store in my sleep 
 okay i think everythings set you have got the number for cape cod right just in case something goes wrong 
 what difference does it make 
 come on come on you yellow belly the whole thing first name and last name 
 you are a dumb whackedout little fuck do you know that 
 to look at the dirty magazines i can see all the naked women i want and it doesnt cost me a cent 
 your job you have got five thousand bucks what do you want a pieceofshit job like that for 
 so i can get my job back 
 and why the hell would you give me money 
 what do you care where it comes from its yours 
 shit i dont want your money you little twerp its probably stolen anyway 
 no its five thousand dollars

 good keep it up and maybe one day you will grow up and become a great man like me 
 definitely id say you have hit the nail on the head 
 seventeen i remember when i was seventeen christ i was one little whackedout sonofabitch when i was seventeen is that what you are son one little whackedout crazy fella 
 seventeen 
 i thought maybe he was pretending 
 of course it hurts what does it look like 
 does it hurt 
 jesus man you are one fucking mess 
 sure auggie i follow when you dont know nothing its like paradise i know what that is its after you are dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels 
 if it happens it happens if it doesnt it doesnt do you understand what im saying you never know whats going to happen next and the moment you think you know thats the moment you dont know a goddamn thing thats what we call a paradox are you following me 
 okay auggie i got it you dont have to yell 
 when i tell you its open its open when i tell you its open 
 sure auggie i got it the stores closed and when do i tell them its open 
 i just do what you tell me auggie you tell me to sweep so i sweep 
 thats how it is with sidewalks people come people go and they all drop shit on the ground as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next the first spot is dirty again 
 huh 
 it will never be finished 
 good auggie real good all finished 
 howd you do out there jimmy 
 damned if i know but it has a nice ring to it dont it 
 what does that mean 
 any time and congratulations to you and your wife just remember though in the immortal words of rudyard kipling a woman is just a woman but a cigar is a smoke 
 thanks for the tip 
 it will keep them fresh if they get too dry they will break and you dont want that to happen do you tobacco is a plant and it needs the same loving care youd give an orchid 
 the refrigerator 
 a good choice you wouldnt want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers would you remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out 
 i think i will take them 
 fortyfour they are on special this week from the canary islands a real bargain 
 and these 
 fiftysix that girl had on a corset 
 and these 
 seventyeight dollars the girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties 
 and how much are these 
 they dont come cheap son these little honeys are works of art rolled by hand in a tropical climate most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage the smooth delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another 
 henry told cyrus hed kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again when henry makes a threat like that people tend to take him seriously 
 and hes never tried to get in touch with his son 
 no i dont suppose it has he was broken up like nobodys business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead 
 it cant have been easy on him walking around with that on his conscience all these years 
 jesus had nothing to do with it if hed been involved he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did 
 jesus 
 dont put words in my mouth what im saying is she drove off in cyruss car and went to the fivespot lounge with him for a drink what im saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car he was in no shape to drive but he drove the car anyway and before he could get her back to where she lived the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed cyrus lived but he came out of it a cripple his left arm was so mangled the doctors had to cut it off small punishment for what he did if you ask me 
 you mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind 
 his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born louisa was henrys younger sister and she and the baby moved in with us four or five years go by and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue tail between his legs wanting to patch things up with louisa i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door they are both big men those two and if they ever started to tangle youd see some teeth jumping on the floor i guarantee it so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet and the poor girl never came back 
 those are pretty hostile words 
 and nothing thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said i dont have a father as far as im concerned that sonofabitch is dead 
 and 
 i figured he had a right to know 
 and you told your nephew about it 
 well one thing i suppose but i dont think it has anything to do with this a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said shed spotted thomass father working at some gas station outside of peekskill 
 has anything happened lately anything unusual or unexpected 
 no thank you 
 do you want something to drink a beer a glass of water 
 hes in trouble all right but i dont have any idea what it is 
 i was about to get run over by a car and your nephew pulled me back he saved my life i sensed he was in trouble so i offered to put him up for a few days maybe i should have pressed him a little more i dont know i feel pretty stupid about it now 
 which brings me back to my original question what was he doing here in the first place 
 i shouldnt have let him go 
 his mothers dead and he hasnt seen his father in twelve years 
 and his parents 
 he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn 
 he doesnt go to the trinity school 
 i always knew that boy had an imagination but now hes gone and made up a whole new life for himself do you mind if i sit down hes been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby and we dont live in manhattan we live in boerum hill in the projects 
 thats what he said he told me he lived with his mother and father on east seventyfourth street 
 his parents is that what he told you his parents 
 as far as i know he went back to his parents 
 i just want to know where he is 
 look lady thats enough if you dont calm down im going to throw you out do you hear me right now 
 and what was he doing here in the first place thats what i want to know whats a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for are you some kind of pervert or what

 i just tell it like it is mister if im getting on your nerves though you might want to think about hiring me 
 sonofabitch you are some piece of work arent you 
 once you look at it you are going to want to buy it from me thats guaranteed and thats the price five bucks so if you are not willing to spring for it you might as well not bother to look it will just tear you up inside and make you miserable 
 five bucks you mean you are going to charge me five bucks just to look at it 
 it will cost you five bucks 
 its rundown all right but drawing a picture wont improve the way it looks lets see what you did rembrandt 
 im working on a sketch that old garage of yours is so rundown its kind of interesting 
 just passing through a lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view theres other places to roam kid thats all im saying you dont want to make a nuisance of yourself 
 just passing through 
 i dont know what you look like boy as far as i can tell you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night you live in this town or on your way from here to there 
 im not going to rob you mister do i look like a thief 
 let me give you some useful information son theres two dollars and fiftyseven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you have put in casing the joint so far you wont make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains however you slice it thats a losing proposition 
 its a free country isnt it as long as im not trespassing on your property i can stay here till kingdom come 
 why dont you pick some other spot it gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning 
 i dont know i havent decided yet

 i dont know hello mom hello dad something like that 
 what do you want me to say 
 arent you going to say anything 
 well what 
 well 
 its me honey its mom 
 yeah who is it 
 i dont know tommy you think anyone gives a rats ass about kuwait i read something about the head sheik over there he marries a different virgin every friday and then divorces her on monday you think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that 
 of course theres gonna be a war you think theyd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun i mean theres plenty of beach but not a hell of a lot of water half a million soldiers it aint no seaside holiday you can bet on that 
 i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes they came with a free gift coupon in every pack 
 sure hes the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle 
 they didnt have to do a thing thats all im saying the team was good the best fucking team in baseball but then they had to screw it up they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge a mess of porridge 
 jesus tommy it aint science you know you got your good trades and your bad trades thats how it works 
 okay joke about it i dont give a shit 
 management those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses 
 yeah and why is that 
 i will tell you why they are not going anywhere 
 twelveeleven twelvetwelve twelvetwelve 
 so whats the time 
 ticktock ticktock 
 you still have that watch auggie gave you 
 huh 
 hey jimmy you got the time 
 now ask him who his mother was 
 like it or not cyrus thats my name cole just like yours 
 i was going to tell him but in my own time in my own time 
 if it doesnt make any difference why not just say it 
 its all right i really do know them 
 we came here to deliver some clean laundry 
 research i worked the scene right into my story that makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible 
 wow they sure did a job on you 
 hi kid 
 good im glad thats settled 
 fuck you too you white sonofabitch 
 dont worry about it you have got friends now remember just behave yourself and everything will work out 
 i pay auggie and i have got nothing eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city 
 you will do it all right you fuck up you have got to undo the damage thats how it works buster if you dont do it im going to throw you out of here do you understand me if you dont pay auggie what you owe him im finished with you 
 im not going to do it 
 im serious all right you have got to square it with auggie since you wont give the money back to the creeper you can use it to make things right with auggie thats probably better anyway better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies 
 what are you talking about you cant be serious 
 heres what you are going to do you are going to open up your backpack take out your bag of money count out five thousand dollars and hand it over to auggie 
 he was out five thousand bucks he said he kept saying it over and over five thousand bucks down the drain he wouldnt stop five thousand bucks five thousand bucks he was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks 
 no wonder he was angry 
 i suppose so he never told me about it 
 cuban cigars you mean he had some hankypanky going with those guys 
 the water was dripping see i turned it off but it was still dripping and then auggie had to go out and so i left the back room and later on well later on when auggie came back the whole place was flooded his cuban cigars got all messed up you know soaked through just when he was about to sell them to these rich guys in suits 
 if you dont tell me what happened how do you expect me to know that i need facts not opinions 
 it wasnt my fault 
 well 
 it was more complicated than that there was a reason 
 so you lost the job is that what you are telling me he just up and fired you 
 keep up with that attitude and you wont have a future seventeen is a hell of an age to die is that what you want 
 that money is my whole future 
 a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you 
 no way theres no way im giving that money back its my money now 
 yeah well you have to be nuts to do what you did if you want my opinion you should give this money back to the creeper just give it back and tell him you are sorry 
 thats it in a nutshell 
 so you robbed the robbers and now the robbers are after you 
 six thousand dollars five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars to be exact 
 you have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble dont you so how much does it come to 
 thats just it i didnt think i just did it 
 good thinking 
 and started to run 
 and started to run 
 yeah i picked it up 
 christ you didnt just see what happened they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up 
 not exactly i mean there was more to it than i told you 
 so you are saying it wasnt like that at all 
 here catch 
 yeah it might be 
 is it yours 
 i dont know 
 you dont believe me huh look i will show you its all in this book 
 nice try you had me going for a second but no no writer would ever do a thing like that would he 
 his only copy i mean if you think you are going to die whats more important a good book or a good smoke and so he huffed and he puffed and little by little he smoked his book 
 his only copy 
 its N right and hes caught in leningrad during the siege im talking about one of the worst moments in human history five hundred thousand people died in that one place and theres bakhtin holed up in an apartment expecting to be killed any day he has plenty of tobacco but no paper to roll it in so he takes the pages of a manuscript hes been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes 
 absolutely we would be honored 
 yes an invitation i apologize for springing it on you at the last minute but mr benjamin and i are attending a celebration tonight and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us isnt that right mr benjamin 
 excuse me for asking but you arent married are you 
 uh actually i tend to shy away from that kind of thing 
 pick two or three now that the coffers are open you might as well take advantage of me 
 here we are rembrandts drawings edward hopper van goghs letters 
 i mean earlier we could have planned something 
 i just did 
 hey hey happy birthday why didnt you tell me 
 its my birthday im seventeen years old as of fortyseven minutes ago and i think i should celebrate having made it this far 
 celebrate what for 
 no not the end the beginning his son was just a little boy at the time but the years passed and when he grew up he became a skier too one day last winter he went out by himself for a run down the mountain he gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock just as hes unwrapping his cheese sandwich he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice right there at his feet he bends down to take a closer look and suddenly he feels that hes looking into a mirror that hes looking at himself there he is dead and the body is perfectly intact sealed away in a block of ice like someone preserved in suspended animation he gets down on all fours looks right into the dead mans face and realizes that hes looking at his father 
 the end 
 all right listen carefully about twentyfive years ago a young man went skiing alone in the alps there was an avalanche the snow swallowed him up and his body was never recovered 
 no way 
 yeah right the inspiration its a true story anyway so i dont suppose it can hurt can it 
 the inspiration 
 okay just a little hint i cant tell you the story but i will tell you what gave me the idea for it 
 come on just a little hint 
 if i tell you i might not be able to finish it 
 thats logical and if you dont sleep you dont need a bed saves you money too so whats this story you are working on anyway 
 if you dont sleep you dont dream if you dont dream you dont have nightmares 
 just so you dont overdo it you dont want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish 
 once a story gets hold of you its hard to let go besides im making up for lost time 
 you work too hard you know that 
 i dont know two or three it was pretty late 
 what time did you get to bed last night 
 thanks 
 one sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open 
 ah coffee smells good 
 fair enough we wouldnt want to get carried away would we now call your aunt em and let her know you are alive 
 lets not get too idealistic 
 maybe or maybe its the other people who dont belong 
 thats because we dont belong anywhere you dont fit into your world and i dont fit into mine we are the outcasts of the universe 
 it looks like they have met in this apartment 
 it might not be far but its another galaxy black is black and white is white and never the twain shall meet 
 what makes you think you will be any safer around here its only about a mile away from where you live 
 the man has friends and they are not likely to forgive me if i testify against him 
 if they put this creeper in jail then youd be safe 
 you are joking right i mean thats your way of trying to be funny right 
 why dont you go to the police 
 i just happened to be walking by all of a sudden the creeper and this other guy come running out of this checkcashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands they just about ran smack into me the creeper recognized me and i knew he knew i recognized him if the guy from the checkcashing place hadnt rushed out then screaming bloody murder he would have shot me im telling you the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk but the noise distracted him and when he turned around to see what was happening i took off one more second and i would have been dead 
 so thats the something you werent supposed to see huh 
 i crossed paths with him thats why im trying to stay clear of my neighborhood to make sure i dont run into him again 
 and 
 okay okay its all so stupid theres this guy see charles clemm the creeper thats what people call him the kind of guy you dont want to cross paths with 
 i dont huh and what makes you such an authority on what i want or dont want 
 you dont really want to know 
 close the door sit down in that chair now listen carefully your aunt em came here a couple of days ago she was sick with worry out of her mind we had an interesting talk about you thomas do you understand what im saying your aunt thinks you are in trouble and so do i tell me about it kid i want to hear all about it right now 
 i dont have much time 
 cut it out will you just cut it out and come back here 
 business appointment im seeing my broker at three oclock 
 where the hell do you think you are going 
 i bought it twentynine ninetyfive on sale at goldbaums tv and radio well that just about takes care of it i guess you will be able to watch the ball games you know as a little break from your work 
 where did you get that thing 
 i dont know for helping me out 
 appreciation for what 
 i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation 
 hey its you 
 you too and make sure the light is green before you cross the street oh by the way i liked your book i think you are a hell of a good writer 
 take good care of yourself okay 
 not a penny not a stitch im cool man 
 do you need some money some extra clothes 
 absolutely the world is my oyster whatever that means 
 are you going to be all right 
 you dont have to apologize the coast is probably clear now anyway 
 no hard feelings okay its a small place and i cant get my work done with you around 
 im sorry i messed up you have been very kind to me but all good things have to come to an end right 
 it sounds like our time is up doesnt it 
 two or three nights 
 and how long did i tell you you could stay 
 three nights 
 how long have you been here 
 i didnt ask to come here you invited me remember if you want me to leave all you have to do is say so 
 it just wont do will it i go two and a half years without being able to write a word and then when i finally get started on something when it looks as though i might actually be coming to life again you show up and start breaking everything in my house it just wont do will it 
 im sorry im really sorry i was trying to reach for one of the books up there and then i dont know the sky fell on top of me 
 if you want to steal it thats your business at least i wont have you around here making noise it might be worth it 
 twenty dollars is a lot of money are you sure you can trust me with it i mean arent you afraid i might steal it 
 the world is going to end pretty soon if you dont learn fast look why not make yourself useful im just about out of smokes go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias 
 im a teenager all teenagers are clumsy its because we are still growing we dont know where our bodies end and the world begins 
 a little less clumsiness around here would be nice dont you think 
 im sorry they just they just slipped out of my hands 
 jesus do you make a lot of noise cant you see im trying to work 
 you will find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator cereal in the cupboard coffee on the stove take whatever you want but its time for me to get started in here 
 eightthirty 
 eightthirty 
 what time is it 
 time to wake up hey kid time to wake up rashid up and out i have to work in here the slumber party is over 
 yeah sometimes i like to dabble too 
 is that what you do draw pictures 
 drawings a good thing 
 twelve thirteen years ago actually he died with his sketch pad open on his lap up in the berkshires one weekend drawing a picture of mount greylock 
 hes dead 
 no he was a schoolteacher but he liked to dabble 
 is your father an artist 
 its strange though isnt it looking at yourself before you knew who you were 
 yeah i can believe it 
 my father did believe it or not that little baby is me 
 nice drawing did you do that 
 i listen on the radio i can see the games just fine that way the world is in your head remember 
 but then you dont get to watch the ball games you told me you were a mets fan 
 i used to have one but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it id just as soon not have one anyway i hate those damn things 
 this is the first house i have been in without a tv 
 thats it just the two rooms 
 same here but i had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon you know to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture and he said it would be okay 
 i didnt expect to see you again 
 suit yourself but if you change your mind heres the address 
 i can take care of myself dont worry 
 in case you are wondering i like women not little boys and im not offering you a longterm lease just a place to crash for a couple of nights 
 thanks but i will manage 
 im not people im just me and i do whatever i goddamn want to do got it 
 people dont do that kind of thing not in new york 
 but your body is in the world isnt it if someone offered you a place to stay you wouldnt necessarily refuse would you 
 the material world is an illusion it doesnt matter if they are there or not the world is in my head 
 except that theres no bed is there and no breakfast either 
 yeah thats right 
 uhhuh one of those cozy bed and breakfast places probably 
 here and there around 
 you cant be more specific than that 
 the what i have kind of run away from home you see it has nothing to do with my parents or money i saw something i wasnt supposed to see and for the time being its best that i keep myself out of sight 
 the what 
 thats where the what comes in 
 then what are you doing in park slope its a little far from home isnt it 
 of course where else 
 in manhattan 
 east seventyfourth street 
 and where do momsie and popsie live 
 oh no momsie and popsie have oodles 
 thats true but i also owe you something and im not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job what is it family problems money problems 
 you dont know me from a hole in the wall 
 you dont have to tell me if you dont want to but i might be able to help 
 mostly what 
 cocktail hour is over the young man would like to order a hamburger 
 well maybe just one to be polite 
 look kid its okay with me you dont have to play games if you want a hamburger or something go ahead and order it 
 just one bottle i believe in moderation 
 yeah sure and i bet you had lobster last night along with two bottles of champagne 
 i mean breakfast 
 you must eat lunch pretty early its only eleven oclock 
 thats okay i have already had lunch 
 are you sure you dont want some food to go along with it it might help to absorb some of that liquid you dont want to slosh around too much when you stand up 
 rashid rashid cole 
 good lemonade it is im paul 
 i dont drink coffee on the other hand since you insist if you offered me a cold lemonade i wouldnt say no 
 come on at least let me buy you a cup of coffee 
 thats all right if i think of something i will send my butler over to tell you 
 you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance 
 well if you put it that way 
 yes it is its a law of the universe if i let you walk away the moon will spin out of orbit pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years 
 its okay mister no big deal 
 i owe you something 
 i just happened to be there the right place at the right time 
 no wait you cant just walk off you saved my life 
 no harm done everythings okay now i have got to be going 
 i cant believe i did that christ im walking around in a fog 
 watch out man you will get yourself killed like that 
 i dont mean to pry but i see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back and i begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions arent stowed in there are you in some kind of trouble or what 
 if you are lucky then again it depends on what you call living 
 i will take the iced coffee you only live once right 
 everything is real in here honey as real as the color of my hair 
 do you have real iced coffee or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes 
 hot coffee or iced coffee 
 yeah give him another one and i will take a cup of coffee while you are at it 
 you want another one of these too 
 yes please 
 lettuce and tomato 
 yes please 
 fries 
 medium rare please 
 how do you want that cooked 
 didnt say i was buyin did i what you want down just bein curious is all 
 $N an acre thats what i paid ole wont take a dime less you got no choice on that 
 hid it from my mom caught a mess a sea runs damn things still in my closet 
 oh yeh 
 i am a bastard im a big hun nazi son of a bitch and i still got your bamboo fishing rod 
 might do the same i have to warn you bout that chief im not screwed together like i used to be 
 the batterys in thats done with besides youd do the same for m 
 what are you sellin em for why dont we start there 
 seven acres im wonderin what youd pay for em just curious is all 
 keep it tonight we will catch fish i will see ya back on the docks 
 dont know how long its take to get a charge 
 or from the cut on his hand which is more probable 
 im a hemotologist not a detective 
 with no bone or scalp or hair present would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a mans skull 
 you dont 
 i dont know 
 im a hemotologist sir i was asked only t 
 well if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a mans skull 
 none 
 no bits of bone no particles of scalp no strands of hair 
 bits of blood and wood what else would there be 
 you scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff where a fellas hand goes and what did you see under your microscope besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings 
 thats obvious 
 and the blood could not have belonged to defendant seeing that his type is o negative 
 no but as i say the type is rare ten percent of caucasian males 
 but you cant say with any certainty that the blood was his 
 carl heines type 
 so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all it was human yes type b positive 
 did he see some danger from defen 
 that hed keep an eye on miyamoto watch out for him 
 when your son came back from the war what did he say about all this 
 well every time i see him in town or somewhere hes starin at me with these narrow eyes givin me his mean face 
 what do you mean by dirty looks 
 just showed up at my door big as life and twice as mean wanted to talk to my son 
 and when he came home did he write you about this or phone perhaps 
 in the war europe i believe they could hardly send him to the pacific could they 
 now defendants father had also died by that point where was the defendant when you sent his family their equity 
 their kids was born here so when the oldest that one there was twentylast payment gets made and he could own it 
 why if they could never take title 
 carl held it for em called it a lease they make payments every june and december 
 but back in N japaneseborn could not own land so 
 they fished tgether went to school carl junior treated him like a white person like any friend 
 so the defendant knew the deceased your son even then 
 him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land lived in a pickers cabin at first 
 you done your math right 
 it is 
 is that your third question 
 so that makes what would have been $N into $N doesnt it if you sent the equity back you had a profit of $N 
 a thousand 
 second question what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre 
 tried to defaulted on their payments 
 just three questions the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $N 
 well it does seem mighty warm in here specially for mr hooks 
 thank you mr gillanders thank you for coming down in this cold weather 
 now how is miyamoto gonna know in advance that carl loses two batteries must happen once ever N years or so 
 well what if 
 you mean miyamoto followed him out there and suckerpunched him 
 all right what if the defendant heard so carl let him aboard to help and then the fishing gaff 
 compressed air horn most likely hope to god some man hears you in that fog 
 course if carl lost both batteries dead in the water his radio wouldnt work so how would he signal for help 
 boat has two batteries lose one you run off the other til morning carl musta lost both so miyamoto there gave him one a his 
 no sense to have any at all even the right size its like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car nobody does 
 now the sheriff believed that the dN battery in carls well was carls own spare even though it was too large f 
 couldnt get on the boat id just shoot the feller then tie up throw him inta th drink and skip bein the first gillnetter in history to make a successful forced boarding 
 so the fishing gaff method wouldnt make sense 
 im sorry about that it wasnt mine in the first place 
 its a joke maneuver up to carls boat tie your lines fast come aboard all against carls will its the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of 
 now if you wanted to kill a man think youd try boarding against his will and hitting him with a fishing gaff 
 unwritten rule of the sea we dont bother each other stick to ourselves ask anybody 
 now mister gi 
 i said no further questions 
 you are implying th 
 question withdrawn you may step down 
 it seems human to me 
 doesnt it seem to you mrs miyamoto that your mistake was in being deceitful concealing information during the course of a sheriffs investigation 
 well it seems to me 
 we were afraid silence seemed better to come forward seemed like a mistake 
 so you hid the truth deliberately 
 trials arent only about truth mr hooks even though they should be they are about what people believe is true 
 but if truth was on your side whatever were you worried about 
 because the facts could be misconstrued as murder 
 why not 
 we discussed that and decided not to 
 up in the air was that your reaction 
 yes and then what was there to call about everything was up in the air 
 and then something did carl heine was found dead with his head crushed 
 of course not we are just not quick to run and boast in case something went wrong 
 you thought the deceased might break his promise 
 so five hours plenty of time for a call he was excited you say in the sense of being overjoyed 
 closer to eight 
 your husband returned at what seven oclock 
 we hear how carlpassed away only a few hours later 
 so then youand your husband must have called friends relatives to tell them the amazing news yes 
 happy for him and relieved 
 you wereoverjoyed yourself to hear the news 
 i said excited not agitated he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed 
 its not for the they only get to convict him 
 i did but the jury wont s 
 did you write that column 
 look i want to forget you i do i think if you hold me just this once i can walk away and never speak to you again 
 you have to hear this i can never touch you ishmael not once not ever theres no half way as much as i know it hurts you you have to let this go 
 theres no one here and i have got to talk to you 
 im married ishmael it isnt right for us to be alone people will t 
 the japs did it 
 im sorry about your arm kabuo and i are very sor 
 i couldnt say anything i just stood there hating her 
 i dont mean everyone just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them or run a newspaper 
 we all expect the world to be fair as if we have some right t 
 look at my face its the face of the people who did that my father hardly speaks english we are in bad trouble you have to see that 
 its just pearl harbor people are a little crazy right n 
 it will be over soon i can get you money 
 my father cant get our money from the bank we have a few dol 
 i lie to my parents every day and every night 
 there cant be any wrong in this ha 
 well i dont do it for just anybody 
 i can just feel my spirits soar 
 why we are only talking 
 my mom would be the problem 
 we are japanese not mexican ishmael he will slice you up with a ceremonial sword 
 your friends would your dad would kill me with a machete 
 the best part was that there was a this to debate the wrongness of 
 easy slow is best 
 i told myself that was good that it made our friendship special and didnt mean she was ashamed of it necessarily 
 at school she kept mostly to the japanese kids and sort of ignored me as if all of our times alone togetherin the hollow cedar everywherewere a secret 
 hes still got a good grip we need to dig more 
 but he found you 
 your father fought at belleau wood it took him years to get over it nightmares tears b 
 those arent the facts that matter 
 they are not his neighbor like you are he is a husband a father he risked his life for their country the same as you 
 seattle boys think hes guilty they say the evidence is rock solid 
 they only arrested that poor soul because hes japanese 
 you have been busy with that trial i suppose such a travesty 
 i felt milhollands report in my pocket and wondered why i wasnt telling her telling someone what id found 
 agnostics dont believe or disbelieve ma we just dont pretend we know 
 you dont believe in god anymore 
 oh in a heartbeat 
 and your evaluation of the defendant could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff so quickly there would be no sign of struggle 
 what else i had the boy teach me kendo includingthe importance of the bow 
 well what then sergeant 
 more than eager he was out to make a point 
 so wide crosssection of men to evaluate and the day that the defendant volunteered for this demonstration did you find him eager 
 it was my specialty sir i trained several thousand over the years 
 and you were generally experienced in training men for handtohand combat 
 they were japaneseamerican boys yes sir 
 pretty darn clear 
 and replaced it later with the new one thats your inference 
 you bet and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off he coulda left this line behind on carls boat 
 so if defendant had tied up to deceaseds boat with that last one would those cleats have lined up 
 found on carls boat too starboard side second cleat from the stern but it doesnt match carls lines it matches miyamotos perfect 
 and the last 
 from carl heines boat all his were like this one threestrand manila new condition braided in loops not bowlined like miyamotos 
 and the next one 
 comes off third cleat from the stern port side and its brand new unlike the rest 
 these are fishermen alvin they dont talk at all to each other and less to me specially gossip 
 so noimmediate suspicion nogeneral talk of enmity between the two 
 nossir id gone to tell the wid to tell mrs heine 
 and you werent there when the coroner examined the wound 
 japanese stickfighting they are trained as kids yknow to kill with sticks 
 could you tell me what kendo is 
 well i was a doctor in the jap theater in the war i saw those kendo wounds many times looked exactly like this one 
 and why is that 
 i said that if i was playing sherlock holmesid maybe look for a japanese person with a bloody gun butt a righthanded fella to be precise 
 did you say more 
 he said could it be somebody hit him and i said you want to play sherlock holmes here 
 so when the sheriff returned you showed him the injury to the deceaseds head 
 tht was summation your h 
 your honor all of this is speculation including mr hooks dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call 
 objection 
 you are a hard man to trust sir you sit before us with no expression keeping a poker f 
 all right what did your son say to that effect 
 objection asking witness to speculate about deceaseds state of mind 
 my gosh alvin was i supposed to object every time you did that 
 objection asking the witness to speculate 
 as peculiar as a struggle between a N pound man and an assailant strong enough to subdue himthat leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake 
 no sir i cant not beyond a reasonable doubt 
 were you sir can you prove one word of all your fancy story 
 thats curious i was appealing to their intelligence 
 and i wouldnt blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful at a tactic that insults their intelligence 
 thats how journalists answer questions 
 i asked you a question you are writing a tract h 
 he didnt want to lose any more 
 greedy 
 like you couldnt believe 
 your line of work you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth 
 oh yes 
 but isnt the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces 
 then putting them together so truth is revealed 
 my expertise is that im a journalist 
 and since you confess this is all pure guesswork what is your expertise sir are you a detective of sorts 
 twelve 
 well the freighter the twine the blood the knife the cup the watch the second battery the phantom lantern the fishing gaff the cracked gunnel the skull wound the blond hair thats eleven things 
 im sorry was there a question in there 
 everything had to happen just right for your little story to fly i mean a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons 
 objection speculation 
 maybe it went where carl went over the side 
 he said he didnt want that life no more hed been saving to buy a farm he was sorry i got sick but pretty excited to get back his fathers place 
 but carl was a fisherman and successful at it 
 carl heine came 
 and then your stroke came this summer and you put your property on the market i believe you said september N which remember is eight days before carl heine died and who comes spetember N wanting to buy 
 oh yeh but this is nine year ago i had my healt i wasnt wantin to sell 
 mr jurgensen did he offer to buy the seven acres from you 
 oh yeh he said someday he would get his land back 
 robbed he was angry 
 i had a spare battery in my shed i brought it down and put it in just before the sheriff showed up 
 well the sheriff found two batteries in your well if you left one with carl heine how is that possible 
 yes 
 didnt go anywhere else no errands no purchases just straight to the boat thats the truth 
 i slept til onethirty when my wife woke me up with the news we talked for a few hours i left at six and went straight to my boat 
 i see now what happened the day carl heine was found before your arrest 
 you mean this morning the new story the battery story that one is the truth thats a question sir 
 i have told the truth 
 my apologies do you regret not telling the truth 
 should have told everything meaning you should have told the truth 
 i should have told everything right away i know that now and i regret it 
 well initially is an interesting word sir youd been arrested you had a lawyer and you still claimed ignorance 
 yes initially 
 but even after you had an attorney you still claimed to know nothing claimed not to have seen carl am i correct 
 sheriff said right off i was under suspicion i didnt have a lawyer 
 actually she said you had decided decided not not come forward 
 as my wife testified we were considering it 
 some seamans loast report stuffed in a cabinet good as lost forever no one knows 
 they got transferred that day out to cape flattery 
 no night of the N th morning the N th we replaced two guys named miller and milholland 
 you mean early morning the N th 
 me and smoltz came on dogwatch september N 
 how long you have this detail 
 shorthard the radio transmis sions write em up file em in a cabinet nobody ever looks just take up space 
 and you keep the records or contribute to em 
 since september last guys got transferred 
 you have the night watch on the radio 
 dont prove there was two lanterns coulda been the one in the cabin 
 its on the twine too but its not r 
 you are right i better use two 
 you gonna climb that with one arm 
 have a look at nothing 
 here now what are you fixin to do 
 its public record if the public cares enough to read it 
 never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place 
 wont take two 
 you said three minutes 
 three kids whats she going to do 
 i did boy 
 its a rare thing takes a turning point 
 we dont let go you s 
 naw i have seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes 
 you ever been strangled by a single hand 
 if i whistle those boys will see you and come runnin you are the story today 
 i will take two one for later 
 cigarette 
 well anything coulda caused that 
 the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel just below the mast 
 you think so 
 he hit his head on the way in 
 still and all carl was a strong swimmer he m 
 the freighter started through at N the sea water seeped into carls watch and stopped it at N 
 still a coincidence timing and all 
 the knife what knife 
 then wheres the lantern and wheres the knife 
 but you could be wrong he could have climbed up earlier 
 maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio which is now working same report milholland heard and that makes him get the lantern fast before the freighters wake can bang it around 
 maybe 
 coincidences happen you run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere splitsecond tragedy happens every day or maybe 
 just as the freighter comes through isnt that quite a coincidence 
 he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there so he climbs up to cut it down 
 still lashed to the mast 
 miyamoto gave him the battery and left carls boat was running he goes back to fishing but at some point he thinks of the lantern 
 fell 
 thats when he fell 
 because the second lantern the one on the mast was never found so we have to ask 
 well why does it 
 thats what mr miyamoto reported and hed have no reason to lie he couldnt know that it would help his case 
 now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived one in carls hand the second lashed to the mast 
 well it shows the prosecutor was wrong it was carls boat that was dead in the water or hed never have put up the lantern 
 tell us why that lantern would be so significant 
 to my father everything counts 
 hes looking down and hes not thinking bout the man you were yesterday hes proud of the man you are tonight thats what counts 
 yes he was 
 your daddy was quite a feller 
 im wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones in the middle of the night 
 you are wondering why i held it 
 this tastes horrible hmmn 
 no you dont 
 its the way it happened i know it is 
 look no way im lettin you out there in a half hour you could be in canada 
 sheriff i cant afford not to fish toni 
 sure blood gets all over your hand sheriff ask any fisherman 
 you gaff with the hook end bloods on the butt where your hand goes 
 sure you did help me with this hold cover willya 
 naw i had that around for a while 
 see you replaced a mooring line lately this ones new 
 i was checking the cables 
 you always run with the well open 
 we have a warrant to search your boat 
 what for sheriff 
 and what do you believe 
 i told your wife trials arent always so much about actual truth as about what folks believe is true thats sad and its real 
 you think that is the truth 
 i want you to tell the truth 
 you want me to say that 
 you wont hear that from hooks because the charge is firstdegree murder which requires premeditation he cant change the charge 
 im more a hotblooded killer huh like a soldier like a samurai 
 that you came upon carl by accident like you said gave him the battery like you said asked him about the seven acres like you said 
 and whats that 
 i should show them an american 
 so every time you think about showing that jury strength or honor or composure or dignity 
 mr gudmundsson we know what that jury is looking at 
 now this jury is gonna be lookin at the evidence with one eye and at you with the oth 
 you are wonderinhow come i never ask if you did it 
 you wouldnt even see it move 
 sure i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open right above your left ear 
 bet theres a few things you could teach me kendo for one 
 i think you like learning 
 you must think i like losing 
 you mean do i like to take the offensive or hang back and wait 
 white or black 
 your daddy played i asked down at the japanese community center you smoke cigars 
 what makes you think i play 
 you said that that was your testimony 
 even though a dN is too big and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in which makes it a peculiar choice for a spare 
 what else could it be 
 which you inferred was replaced by the dN which must have been a spare 
 one dN and one dN in the well and a dead dN on the deck 
 the damage was considerable but shes insured thanks again 
 and her farmhouse 
 shes alright nels thanks for asking 
 how is your motherinlaw 
 possible but not darn likely 
 operating this winch youd rarely operated before doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of N poundsis it possible possible that he struck his head after death possible 
 you dont remember 
 he was heavy but we were real careful but i dont remember him hitting anything anywhere 
 you dont think so 
 i dont think so 
 is it possible his head struck the transom or the stern gunnel or the net roller as you were bringing him in 
 now you have testified that the deceased was a heavy man and hard to bring out of the net 
 i believe so 
 im curious the dN that was refitted into the deceaseds well was it exactly the same brand and model as defendants 
 apparently 
 so the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery hmmn 
 no 
 no spare 
 two dN s thats the kind his well was fitted for 
 sheriff how many batteries and what size did you find on defendants boat 
 it was dead we had it tested maybe the dN was the spare and he had to use it 
 but he had a spare dN you said right there why not use that 
 hes done some onthespot refit ting you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the dN 
 now i did some measuring down at the chandlery a dN is one inch wider than a dN it would be too large for the deceaseds well 
 it is 
 you found three batteries you say a dN and dN in the well and a spare dN on the cabin floor correct 
 you have to wonder 
 a little yes you have to wonder 
 does it now 
 didnt think about it at the time so no it didnt strike me odd 
 and yet you started the engine right up with all those lights drawing all night the batteries had that much charge did that strike you odd 
 yessir thered been real heavy fog 
 i think you testified all the lights were on cabin mast net lights picking lights 
 maybe 
 right in the middle of the floor 
 maybe the assailant straightened the cabin and forgot the cup 
 yes im sure 
 are you absol 
 absolutely not probably one or two hours four at the most 
 yes you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceaseds right hand the report says arecent origin how recent as much as N hours before death 
 can i say something here 
 for the third time yes 
 but you are certain that he died by drowning 
 for certain no 
 and that you cant say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death 
 i already said that b 
 is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was 
 sure anythings poss 
 is it possible 
 if the head was moving fast enough but i dont see how it could be 
 so if his head struck something narrow and flat the gunnel of a boat a net roller a fairlead could that have 
 the same 
 can you tell whether an object moved against the head or the other way around or would both look the same 
 obviously 
 in your motorcycle example those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object rather than the reverse yes 
 your report says death by drowning which means he went into the water alive and breathing and the report is accurate 
 well 
 meaning that he wasnt murdered first say on the deck of the boat and then thrown overboard 
 thats why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death 
 as i testified it occurs when water mucus and air are mixed by respiration i believe i said that 
 so thisfoam you found in the lungs how does it get there 
 thats all he said 
 the question is more about the defendants attitu 
 carl said he didnt like kabuo much anymore 
 sorry about that mrs heine shall i repeat the ques 
 you can speak for what he said just like you did for mr hooks 
 i cant speak for him 
 carl ever say he got one 
 he had no reason to 
 those dirty looks defendant ever aim one of those at you 
 of course not but it was emotional a friends plea set against his mothers attitude 
 carl never lied 
 i guess youd have to guess not having been there with them having to guess whether your husbands report was word for word accurate 
 so the defendant was encouraged to hope or could have been 
 not in those words 
 well he didnt say no did he didnt say no hope existed 
 i wouldnt say encouraged 
 so your husband said hes think it over encouraged mr miyamoto to believe he might sell to h

 maybe we could run some tests kind of a comparison the old and the new 
 such as 
 the sweep is just routine not even police action id like to see some sort ofmeaningful evidence 
 thats up to you field guys hq wants you to break em in when you do the annual security sweep in january 
 well the soldiers we have got now they have been through all kinds of heavy shitand they have always got the job done now these new ones these hot shots of yourswhat kind of action have they seen they are battletested arent they

 yes they are here oh white orchids would you believe it i havent had white orchids since i was a debutante whats this 
 smart move oh by the way did you get my flowers you know those orchids from my greenhouse the fog finally lifted over long island and they flew them down this morning 
 but you have you have given me all that inside information first thing tomorrow im going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of venezuelan oil 
 i only wish there were something i could do for you 
 i knew you would 
 oh of course i understand at least i think i do 
 according to our tax advisers shes only soso but thats the way the oil gushes a man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders all those little people who invest their life savings 
 oh that kind of a merger is she young pretty 
 its all rather complicated what we call high finance but it so happens that the president of the venezuelan syndicate has a daughter and 
 you are not 
 quite a while as a matter of fact im not coming back at all 
 a merger how long will you be gone 
 you see we have those oil interests in venezuela and i just got a cable from dad the board of directors decided on a merger 
 where to south america oh that is unexpected 
 not tomorrow either you see i have to leave something unexpected came up im sailing right away 
 tomorrow night 
 im afraid not i cant make it tonight 
 i will meet you on the pier again right after the show 
 yes now about our date for tonight 
 thats funny i never slept better and i had the most wonderful dream i was still on the yacht and the anchor broke loose and we drifted for days and days you were the captain and i was the crew i kept a lookout for icebergs and i sorted your shells and mixed your cocktails and wiped the steam off your glasses and when i woke up i felt like swimming right back to you 
 daphne has a beau i have a beau if we could only find somebody for you 
 me 
 thats wonderful poor josephine 
 from a rich millionaire 
 really 
 im going to see him again tonight and every night i think hes going to propose to me as soon as he gets up his nerve 
 gee i wish id been there 
 nice it was suicidally beautiful 
 did you have a nice time 
 oh no im off that stuff for good 
 lets make it an even million 
 eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars 
 how much do i owe the milk fund so far 
 good morning 
 good night 
 oh you know junior league charity bazaars i used to sell kisses for the milk fund 
 where did you learn to kiss like that 
 mineral baths now really 
 they told me i was caputt finished washed up and now you are making a chump out of all those experts 
 thank you 
 i never knew it could be like this 
 i must be because your glasses are beginning to steam up 
 i think you are on the right track 
 lets throw another log on the fire 
 i got a funny sensation in my toes like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame 
 im not quite sure try it again 
 well 
 so inhale 
 its like smoking without inhaling 
 you are not giving yourself a chance dont fight it relax 
 look its terribly sweet of you to want to help out but its no use i think the light switch is over there and thats the radio its like taking somebody to a concert when hes tone deaf 
 would you like a little more champagne and maybe if we had some music how do you dim these lights 
 im afraid not terribly sorry 
 anything this time 
 all right if you insist 
 i may not be dr freud or a mayo brother or one of those french upstairs girls but could i take another crack at it 
 what is it 
 would you do me a favor 
 if i ever found a girl that could id marry her like that 
 dont talk like that im sure there must be some girl some place that could 
 i have spent six months in vienna with professor freud flat on my back then there were the mayo brothers and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths if i werent such a coward id kill myself 
 maybe if you saw a good doctor 
 thanks just the same 
 is that anything 
 why 
 have you ever tried american girls 
 my family did everything they could hired the most beautiful french upstairs maids got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in boston imported a whole troupe of balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails what a waste of money 
 is it that hopeless 
 what else is there for me 
 how can you think about food at a time like this 
 yes all the money in the world but what good is it mint sauce or cranberries 
 you poor poor boy 
 ever since then numb no feelings like my heart was shot full of novocaine 
 talk about sad 
 yes eight hours later they brought her up by mule i gave her three transfusions we had the same blood type type o it was too late 
 oh no 
 well it was my freshman year at princeton there was this girl her name was nellie her father was vicepresident of hupmobile she wore glasses too that summer we spent our vacation at the grand canyon we were standing on the highest ledge watching the sunset suddenly we had an impulse to kiss i took off my glasses i took a step toward her she took a step toward me 
 oh you couldnt possibly 
 i dont want to bore you 
 what happened 
 not anymore i was in love once but id rather not talk about it how about a little cold pheasant 
 you mean you cant fall in love 
 oh its not your fault its just that every now and then mother nature throws somebody a dirty curve something goes wrong inside 
 that makes me feel just awful 
 complete washout 
 nothing at all 
 see nothing 
 have i im trying all the time 
 have you tried 
 its more like a mental block when im with girls it does nothing to me 
 you mean like frigid 
 they just sort of leave me cold 
 what thing 
 well i dont know how to put it but i have this thing about girls 
 harmless how 
 oh its not that its just that im harmless 
 well of course im sure you are a gentleman 
 you are flattering me 
 its not the icebergs but there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this 
 oh its perfectly safe we are well anchored the ship is in shipshape and the coast guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around 
 you know i have never been completely alone with a man before in the middle of the night in the middle of the ocean 
 completely 
 you mean we are alone on the boat 
 its the crews night off 
 whats on thursdays 
 yea of course now where could they have put it on thursdays im sort of lost around here 
 wheres your shell collection 
 i will say i had two ponies drowned under me 
 water polo isnt that terribly dangerous 
 trophies you know skeetshooing dogbreeding water polo 
 look at all that silverware 
 bon voyage 
 down the hatch as we say at sea 
 i dont mind if i do 
 champagne 
 they shrink when they are marinated 
 a herring isnt it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars 
 oh a member of the herring family 
 what is it 
 caught him off cape hatteras 
 what a beautiful fish 
 its all right for a bachelor 
 its exquisite like a floating mansion 
 of course on thursdays they always serve me in the small salon 
 oh in here 
 yes thats our hurricane cellar 
 oh you have an upstairs and a downstairs 
 yes now lets see where do you suppose the steward set it up 
 love it which way 
 well that depends on whether you are coming or going i mean normally the aft is on the other side of the stern and thats the bridge so you can get from one side of the boat to the other how about a glass of champagne 
 my dad is more interested in railroads baltimore and ohio which is the port and which is the starboard 
 mother keeps hers in southampton and dad took his to venezuela the company is laying a new pipe line 
 three 
 just regulation size we have three like this 
 it looked so small from the beach but when you are on it its more like a cruiser or a destroyer 
 its not how long it takes its whos taking you 
 do you mind riding backwards it may take a little longer 
 looks like they are on the wrong track 
 i just got this motorboat its an experimental model 
 its sort of funny you being out of gas i mean shell oil and everything 
 i seem to be out of gas 
 its the thought that counts 
 i wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of long island is fogged in 
 thank you and thank you for the flowers 
 its not how long you wait its who you are waiting for 
 been waiting long 
 oh josephine just imagine me sugar kowalczyk from sandusky ohio on a millionaires yacht if my mother could only see me now 
 you heard her yes 
 for me its shell oil

 because he said hes coming to hear us play maybe 
 i am 
 anyway you are going to meet him tonight 
 shells whatever for 
 oh im not going to let this one get away hes so cute collects shells 
 maybe youd better go after him if you dont want to lose him 
 well hes young and handsome and a bachelor and hes a real gentleman not one of these grabbers 
 you dont say 
 shell oil junior hes got millions hes got glasses and hes got a yacht 
 one of whom 
 they repealed prohibition 
 guess 
 what 
 the most wonderful thing happened 
 oh i didnt hear you come in 
 josephine 
 if its at all possible 
 and you will come to hear us tonight 
 its been delightful meeting you both 
 well i guess id better go 
 yes you are in the way hes waiting for a signal from his yacht 
 would you mind moving along please 
 please no names just call me junior 
 shell oil 
 yes so did my father and my grandfather we have all had this passion for shells thats why we named the oil company after it 
 you collect shells 
 its on the account of the shells thats my hobby 
 oh 
 i only come ashore twice a day when the tide goes out 
 why 
 id like to but it may be rather difficult 
 i thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play 
 tonight 
 maybe i will tell you when i know you a little better what are you doing tonight 
 what theory 
 you see i have this theory about men with glasses 
 i beg your pardon 
 you are very kind i will bet you are also very gentle and helpless 
 you know its amazing we never ran into each other before im sure i would have remembered anybody as attractive as you 
 and always the same four hundred 
 riding to hounds 
 opening of the opera 
 inauguration balls 
 they do indeed daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent but i dont care it was such a bore comingout parties cotillions 
 good school and your family doesnt object to your career 
 so do i as a matter of fact i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music 
 oh well i guess some like it hot but personally i prefer classical music 
 yeah real hot 
 syncopators does that mean you play that fast music jazz 
 oh yes quite you know vassar bryn mawr we are only doing this for a lark 
 you are society girls 
 well a group of us are appearing at the hotel sweet sue and her society syncopators 
 for your own amusement 
 no the ukulele and i sing 
 could be do you play the market 
 i will bet just while we were talking you made like a hundred thousand dollars 
 up up up 
 hows the stock market 
 thats very interesting 
 well im not 
 im not interested at all 
 no my cocktail steward look if you are interested in whether im married or not 
 and who mixes the cocktails your wife 
 no my flag steward 
 i quite agree tell me who runs up that flat your wife 
 certainly not with all that unrest in the world i dont think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve 
 which one is yours the big one 
 you have a yacht 
 they run up a redandwhite flag on the yacht when its time for cocktails 
 your view of what 
 would you mind moving just a little you are blocking my view 
 that must be it 
 possible you saw it in a newspaper or magazine vanity fair 
 your face is familiar 
 not at all 
 are you staying at the hotel 
 not very likely 
 havent i seen you somewhere before 
 now really 
 who are you 
 thank you 
 well dont worry i wont sue you no matter who you are 
 because usually when people find out who i am they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars 
 why 
 i wish youd make sure 
 i dont think so 
 you are not hurt are you 
 my fault 
 oh im terribly sorry 
 she doesnt need one i dont have one either 
 wait a minute daphne you havent got a bathing suit 
 just my feminine intuition 
 what makes you so sure

 what else and was i ever crazy about him two in the morning he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad they were out of potato salad so i brought coleslaw so he threw it right in my face 
 saxophone player

 so do i but dont worry we will be seeing a lot of each other 
 i wish theyd put us in the same room 
 seventyfive thats threequarters of a century makes a girl think 
 i will bet there isnt one of them under seventyfive 
 well there they are more millionaires than you can shake a stick at 
 good night sugar

 would you mind terribly 
 want to switch berths with me 
 bienstock he snores to beat the band we cut cards to see who sleeps over him and i always lose wouldnt you know

 hello charlie long time no see 
 yeah most important day of my life whatever listen i chose you to be my maid of honor for a lot of reasons i love you youre my favorite and only halfsister blah blah blah but the main reason i picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years i knew you wouldnt outshine me but here it is my big day my big day and something doesnt feel right maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night i dont know but your misery just isnt working for me anymore 
 wow you look beautiful 
 sure disappear weve been walking away our whole lives 
 you know what im not having this conversation right now 
 hey 
 hey 
 you practically bribed him with your erector set 
 so tony peepants starts ignoring kat he wanted to play with me 
 we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day tony walked me home from school he was my first boyfriend i was fourteen 
 im fine i promise 
 are you sure youre okay 
 i should get going 
 what why what do you mean 
 god kat please dont be nice to me i can take anything right now but you being nice to me 
 but i do i will youre my sister 
 when i freaked out at the pub that was nothing just nerves dont worry about it 
 do you want to come in for a minute we could talk about 
 the wedding i am so so bad i dont think i should be allowed to get married 
 pub golf 
 i dont think i can go through with this 
 bacardi N 
 why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole 
 drunk isnt the same thing as happy amy 
 oh shut up and be happy its always this or that youre never happy you frownyfaced grumplestilskin 
 christ amy 
 did amy tell you she keeps her homecoming tiara by the bed 
 did kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath 
 but im not taking your name buster im a feminist i need icey mr husbandman get me more icey 
 except its scotch 
 perfect all ginny 
 exactly todays my day tomorrow will be my day and the day after that my day 
 theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you 
 you know what i love about all this 
 and she wonders why i swim to the bottom of a lemondrop every time i see her 
 or kat 
 if ed ever found out 
 still 
 it was such a long time ago 
 actually i do 
 you know all that if these walls could talk stuff do you believe it that a place has a memory 
 to make sure youre okay 
 what for 
 sorry to interrupt your dad sent me 
 its not me i swear its her shes magic 
 fred astaire and whats her face 
 last night 
 jeffrey told her last night 
 does kat know 
 i knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together i never in a million years would have dreamt it was jeffrey 
 say something please 
 your probably best off pretending youre asleep 
 whatever you do dont mention italy or politics or baby buggies or edith piaf 
 youd better get going my parents will be round to cart you off to the country 
 so she flirted with tony and you got mad and sent him away who did that leave you and amy reunited 
 she did 
 anyway when that boy came over it was the first time you ever did anything without her and amy wasnt just jealousshe was sad and lonely she missed you 
 mom please 
 before tony you and your sister were best friends i couldnt split you up if your sister ate the spinach you ate the spinach if you threw up 
 trust me this is bigger than tony peepants 
 theres a reason i always tell that tony peepants story you know 
 i was pretty hard on her last night and now shes getting married 
 whats going on with you two 
 so dad rang the bell and when tony peepants opened the door i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches 
 im an american and in america people sue so to prevent a lawsuit i baked a tart and i dont bake 
 it was just after we moved here my little girls got in a fight over tony peepants and they havent made up since 
 she blames tony peepants pinterello for everything the fall of the british empire the cold war the internet 
 why should this be any different besides i have to initiate nick into the family 
 oh no she tells this story at every major holiday 
 i blame tony peepants 
 oh dont be that way 
 id be happy to youre welcome 
 sir yes sir 
 im sure general eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces oh and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the fletcherwootens 
 moms refining her strategy for dday 
 im not as square as my daughter thinks 
 huh 
 my mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture she thinks its 
 why with you 
 wheres nick sleeping

 i had to say something to get you here 
 i thought you said you were crap 
 im a hooker 
 i think i love you mate how do you know so much about so much 
 its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute need a prostitute you did the right thing 
 just because some slags been paid for doesnt mean youve got toyou know 
 you are taking the piss 
 um just about everyone 
 whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding honestly 
 doesnt look like nothing 
 nothing 
 and you do now 
 i didnt deserve her back then 
 lasik surgeon actually 
 oh shut up youre an optician 
 thats when i realized i wanted to be a doctor 
 but somehow it was kats arse that was stung by nettles and you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf 
 and kat was fully clothed 
 oh yes right the rat and parrot 
 it was before you started going out we had lunch at that inn on the lake 
 no 
 remember when we went hiking in the lake district and amy was wearing that little bikini thing 
 no thats not it 
 other than hes shagging your exgirlfriend 
 theres something about him thats just a bit odd 
 what 
 whats his problem 
 no i cant were late for a dance lesson i guess youll have to finish up later 
 sorry can you give us a moment 
 hey man 
 you yanks and your therapy its great its all a bit too touchyfeely for me 
 no tell me 
 nothing nothing 
 what 
 crikey 
 shrink actually 
 ah a philosopher 
 oh hello 
 hey 
 i shagged amy two years ago thats why i ended it and then after you left sod it we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad and you know morally wrong then there was that one other time and that was it 
 im sorry 
 i slept with your sister 
 its the past its nothing but ghosts so just get it off your chest then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu 
 well it was a big deal as late asyesterday or this morning but not anymore 
 brilliant 
 relax take a breath and just say it its no big deal i promise 
 bollocks im sorry i had no idea this would be so difficult 
 when we were together i was too here now im not here enough 
 youre not even listening 
 its not supposed to be anything kat its just my rather feeble attempt to oh i dont know you see i thought i could deny my feelings 
 is this supposed to be an apology 
 well we had a lot of good years but then 
 not for a dog 
 right seven christ thats a long time isnt it 
 seven if you count the onandoff years which i do 
 you were so good to me i swear i never meant to hurt you we were together what five years 
 i should have told you why i broke up with you i was a coward you deserve to know 
 so whats your point 
 it was and it took your sister getting married to get you back here 
 that was a long time ago 
 kat stop it you do you cant even look me in the eye you went back to the states when we split up 
 um news flash i dont give a shit 
 kat wait i dont want you hating me weve never had this talk you know how crap i am at this 
 is that why you brought him because of me 
 its called character god youre predictable 
 kat we must talk this guy theres something not quite right 
 whoa jeffrey slow down you and me were the past im not sure if you noticed but im here with someone else 
 i have regrets 
 so tell me hows unmarried life

 nice speech i thought it was touching and funny 
 i have to im the best man 
 what no no you cant 
 i should go 
 hi 
 hi 
 go ahead kat hate me you were running out of steam on the whole jeffrey thing maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship 
 youre right i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie and after all that the only one who ended up falling for it was me 
 youre judging me oh thats a good one youre lying to me youre lying to your family and youre lying to yourself but youre going to stand there and point a finger at me the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend 
 you let me make a fool of myself you lied to me i dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do its your job its who you are how would you even know if something were real 
 yeah for all i know come monday morning well go back to the real world andand youll be hiring me for your best friend 
 youve always got that to hide behind dont you its just business 
 besides you hired me for my discretion 
 so whats with the nickname 
 he bled a bunch but no there was no peeing 
 and thats when he peed in his pants after the tart 
 i didnt say he was worth it 
 fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set 
 yeah 
 yeah you 
 spontaneously combust 
 what would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think 
 make out with you for free 
 what would you do if you werent an escort 
 desperation 
 there was something in your voice on the phone that day 
 so whyd you say yes to me 
 when i said id never done a wedding before i didnt say that no one ever asked i just never said yes 
 sure but its never easy they say theyre okay with it and they arefor a while then one day theyre not 
 you have had girlfriends 
 its my job 
 im sorry i was such a bitch i really appreciate your doing this 
 you paid me for a lot of reasons closure wasnt one of them 
 he was about to unstick me i paid you to help me get closure 
 i just hate seeing you so stuck 
 oh cut the crap 
 hello goodbye i want you i hate you its all just words none of it means anything what matters is what you do you either stay put or you walk away if you look back youre not walking away 
 yup thats why you get to keep your money 
 but nothing did 
 believe me if anything had happened that would have been one of the highlights for you 
 what 
 no no the three hundred is for you doing it to me 
 and what if i didnt want you toto do that to me 
 not dollars pounds 
 so youre telling me if something had happened last nightit would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars thats a down payment on a ford focus 
 not if you take an advance on your credit card 
 dont they have a limit at those machines 
 if i was going to charge you i would have told you beforehand i thought i explained that 
 of course not howhow could it be nothing happened 
 is this for last night 
 we kissed made out a little then you passed out 
 are you sure 
 ive got this bad taste in my mouth what is it i think its the words morally repugnant 
 come on 
 show me 
 its hard to explain 
 i disappear its not about me 
 subtle 
 oh come on youre like the yoda of escorts 
 i swear i dont have a signature move 
 okay 
 dont stop asking questions okay 
 this is awkward for me talking about it makes me feel better 
 i love that youre asking questions but do you really want to get into all of this 
 my sixthgrade science project was entitled love hurts the heartbreak of human papillomavirus trust me im careful 
 theres a guy on N st and madison you get your results in N hours do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them 
 what do you think 
 i guess so 
 are you asking me if im gay for pay 
 when youre ready to let go to be unsingle and unmiserable you will until then 
 what 
 yes 
 first of all its never out of the blue and second of all 
 sowhat was ioh yeah do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then out of the blue shattered my heart 
 admit it you were disturbed but ultimately moved 
 and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries 
 i have a different story for every woman who asks i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me 
 you shit 
 yeah as an adult i needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex but with rules that couldnt be violated 
 oh no 
 the real story is that my mother was a hippie and a stripper she was insanely inappropriate with me she used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater while i was still in the bath 
 shampoo got it 
 would you grab my shampoo 
 if it makes you feel any better to get your number i had to cough up two roundtrip tickets to amsterdam and a case of minibaileys 
 your friend guaranteed my anonymity 
 i have a friend at the magazine 
 how did you know that was me 
 well happen in the sense that i picked up the phone tracked you down flew you here and gave you six grand out of my N k 
 this happened to you 
 sorry im a little nervous i never thought something like this would happen to me 
 thats right imagine facing it alone 
 not you youre not disgusting youre lovely just the idea that theyd bring an escort i mean a stranger who um didntwho never i mean someones dead 
 i think thats disgusting 
 not the way youre thinking the women wanted me there for support you can understand that 
 a wedding 
 a weekend 
 have you ever done anything like this before 
 i do 
 you stand on your tiptoes 
 what is 
 its cute 
 what 
 graham russell and russell hitchcock 
 who are they 
 im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality except for approval that i cant get enough of 
 you quitting 
 its okay hell ive never paid for it but please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me 
 that wont be an issue believe me i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant no offense 
 great with the occasional stabs of shame now listen this covers the weekend but as we discussed if you want to be intimate we talk money before anything happens 
 how does it feel to get that much money just for being you 
 on the nose i tell you what because youre so cute ill take care of our incidentals 
 six thousand right 
 im compulsive and weird 
 why 
 no count it anyway 
 youre too good for him 
 what does your gut say 
 i dont know 
 what did he say exactly i mean you dont think he wants me back 
 of course he is im here with my new man i love it your magics already working let the suffering begin 
 he was pretty drunk but i think hes still crazy about you 
 jeffrey knows love like he knows macram 
 love 
 well he looks miserable what were you talking about 
 oh yeah so we split it you know as in share people do that 
 the knicks game we both wanted the last hot dog 
 i dont do naked my sister she does naked 
 you know they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked 
 both 
 mmm nice dress or mmm gorgeous i was insane to let you go 
 mmm 
 really dont get too attached 
 mission accomplished 
 yeah but i feel like crap and if you feel like crap its way better to look hot while youre doing it 
 youre funny 
 dont patronize me theyve clearly been at this a while 
 you have feet 
 what color are my shoes 
 exactly i want us to look like we fit but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit its welcome cocktails not prom with this level of matchymatchy we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere 
 you think we look like were trying too hard 
 kat

 therapist

 kat ellis we live two hundred miles away from each other but i have to fly all the way to london to see you you havent visited me once in dc where the hell have you been i have gynecologists that call more often

 hey sigmund you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party 
 and the ass of the man who adores her 
 best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass 
 i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them 
 what do you say to that

 well find out where that signal is coming from then hunt them down like dogs any and all canadian influence must be stopped at all cost 
 maam we are tracking a resistance its probably canadian spies 
 not necessary mr president may i remind you that our countrys heart and soul are at stake and our childrens minds are the battlefield the bastard canadians want to fight us because we wont tolerate their potty mouths well if it is war they want then war they shall have 
 oh uh i dont know if air strikes are necessary 
 we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers its the only way to ensure that their smut cant reach american soil 
 huh 
 what about air strikes 
 as commander in chief i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the uscanada border in anticipation of an attack 
 my fellow americans i have led this fight in the war against profanity i have founded mothers against canada our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time 
 oh god what have i done 
 silence now everyone bow down to me 
 and i thought my mother was the master of guilt geez louise 
 yes and in doing so you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming 
 you have spilled the blood of the innocents now the world belongs to me now begins two million years of darkness and all thanks to you 
 oh 
 silence i am satan 
 oh no you dont this is my fight i dont need your help alan dershwitz

 you are all part of satans army now 
 you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school

 article N you dont mean 
 forgive me for saying so principal victoria but your methods are too shall we say soft as head of the pta i am exercising my right under article N of the pta code 
 ooh yes i think we will have to give detention to those boys 
 we must take action on this immediately 
 well it looks like i will have to send a warning letter out to parents i have to put a stop to this before more children see terrance and phillip 
 terrance and phillip are two very untalented unfunny actors from canada their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage now it appears they have a movie and im positive its not suitable for children 
 what is terrance and phillip 
 terrance and phillip movie oy gevalt not again 
 no worse heres a short list of the things they have been saying 
 the f word 
 no it was worse than that 
 what did my son say principal victoria did he say the s word 
 alright i will make the call 
 i dont care if its dangerous desperate times call for desperate measures mr mackey perhaps i need to remind you of your situation 
 mrs brovlofski the vchip hasnt been fully tested yet it could be dangerous 
 then we will have to resort to plan b and call the vchip organization 
 well some of the children just dont respond to N step programs 
 what do you mean most why not all 
 very encouraging most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths 
 how is the childrens progress 
 this is not a place for fun and games this is rehabilitation now get to it we at mac have a trial to go to

 i know terrance this is quite the shitstorm we have found ourselves in this time 
 oh phillip this cannot be good 
 you would know dummy 
 oh you are such a maroon 
 yeah god no wonder your country is so fucked up 
 the problem is you dont allow your children to think for themselves you try to raise them in a protective bubble and then when they finally get old enough they realize they have been lied to and they resent you for it 
 dont believe the hype 
 the young boy that died lit himself on fire it was unfortunate but how can they blame us

 it cant be 
 evening 
 and i intend to correct that at once i will tell you something mac 
 there is a high levelof passenger dissatisfaction 
 i hear you mac and i appreciate it frankly i dont know what id have done without you on this one 
 i am here to provide service to to all our guests there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction it is my dutyto report this 
 mywings 
 mac you really earned your wings this flight 
 the device has stopped responding 
 on channel N 
 well you did the right thing mac 
 i am here to provide service to to all our guests there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction it is my dutyto report this 
 were you going to give it to them 
 they are awaiting further information 
 and what are they doing now mac 
 i did nothing to the monitors 
 you didnt do anything to the monitors did you mac 
 yes he did yes he did barnes looks at the monitor taylor and the others are still in the dining room 
 oh he did did he 
 i was there officer taylor accessed my cpu directly to open the airlock doors they are not functioning properly 
 werent you down in the dining room 
 hello second mate barnes i was instructed to come to the bridge 
 where the hell did you come from 
 well shut it off at once 
 all too well captain 
 look answer my question 
 its a little late for you to be up 
 what did you say to me 
 aint it the truth must be good to be rich 
 well i guess she figures shes paying for it 
 why should she its her fault all guests are told not to eat in zero gravity but she just wanted to have fun i guess didnt realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery 
 good help is hard to find 
 idiot 
 look you said it doesnt matter to you anyway why do you want to kill more innocent people why 
 i told you not to try anything smart i guess you are too much of a maverick to follow a simple order and thats just too bad for all of you now isnt it 
 look we gave you what you asked for it checks out didnt it what more do you want from us 
 sure you do sending mac out on a little recon work how pathetic problem is it seems mac blew a few fuses or maybe hes just a little drunk were you partying with a robot taylor 
 i dont know what you are talking about 
 taylor you surprise me 
 mac can you hear me come in 
 will you transmit the distress signal 
 that was a joke taylor lighten up why dont you just hold them up to the lens i will write them down and once im through verifying them i will get back to you 
 well preferably in tens and twenties 
 we have the codes here how do you want to receive them 
 uh thats an affirmative roger wilco please proceed 
 who said i will reenter in the pod i got friends out in space ryan friends willing to get me back unnoticed thank god for deregulation huh 
 its still not going to work they will detect you upon reentry in an emergency vessel 
 id advise you to shut up and let me finish taylor you neednt worry about the lifepods because they are all gone jettisoned save for one 
 then we have got to get to the lifepods 
 ok i will the bad news is the ship is history life support will last another N hours maybe 
 you better start making sense 
 now do you want the good news first or the bad news 
 yes i can transmit the code N emergency i just dont think its a prudent move at this juncture 
 what are you talking about can you transmit the code N 
 much as id like to help you and our valued guests im afraid i cant 
 transmit the code N emergency and take us offline override the airlock sensors and hurry we are running out of time we have to get to the pods 
 the bridge is fine taylor how are things down there 
 what is the condition of the bridge 
 why yes ryan i am and thanks for asking you dont have to talk to the intercom i can hear you fine 
 barnes can you hear me are you all right 
 thats very professional sounding of you taylor 
 if anyone can hear me please respond 
 yeah yeah yeah give me a minute here 
 bridge can anyone hear me 
 i can hardly wait 
 well maybe i will surprise you 
 no im all set thanks 
 well maybe i will you sure you dont want anything 
 i think i can handle it 
 uh 
 what and leave you here all by your lonesome 
 nah i already ate why dont you just go down there 
 man im hungry im going to call the steward you want anything 
 thank you 
 thats very pragmatic of you barnes 
 you gotta think of your old age 
 its steady good benefits 
 you want to go back to shuttle work 
 well that hotel begins construction in january theres going to be a lot of shuttle work 
 why didnt they say 
 i dont know everythings up in the air at this point no pun intended 
 so are you on for the next one 
 aint it the truth the two say nothing for a beat 
 well everythings running smoother than a babys ass 
 all right i will give it a shot 
 trust me even checked em with my own eyes 
 you are certain of that 
 why dont you reset and run it again the pods check out ok 
 yes im sure i hit the right commands 
 there must be some mistake you sure you hit the right commands 
 its telling me fail mode confirmed did you see this 
 well its a good thing that i did 
 no i just ran it why are you running it again 
 sounds like you have been talking to mac too much 
 well i guess theres no time like the present i will go run a check on that room just to show we go that extra mile for our guests 
 over and out 
 sheesh aye aye capn 
 good now you will hear from me when i have the new coordinates in the meantime dont bug me 
 thats clear 
 is that clear 
 this is a major screw up on your part goddamn it 
 now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod you are just gonna have to pick me up later 
 lets get something straight chappy 
 goddamn it barnes this really steams my onions 
 i told you i had to teach a few people a lesson 
 well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation 
 dont worry about me im changing coordinates now i have come to far to be tripped up by some dudley doright motherfuckers 
 well blaze your ass out of there you have completely altered your trajectory are we linking up or not 
 this ship is going down in a blaze of glory 
 the others decided to get cute with me so im teaching them a lesson 
 you are not helping my heart condition any barnes now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for 
 damage control what kind of damage whats going on barnes 
 cool your jetsim doing a little damage control 
 so what are we waiting for 
 i know i know 
 its time we lock coordinates 
 N good buddy 
 oh you will get it believe me so i will see you in a few 
 well thats your call doesnt make a damn bit of difference to me just as long as i get my cut 
 i dont know i really havent made up my mind yet we will see how nicely they behave 
 will do what about the distress signal 
 yeah i know bill i came up with the plan remember just have those hangar doors open and ready i can take it from there 
 well dont drag your ass there wont be much of a window for us to link up we will be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours 
 seems like they are cooperating hopefully i will be out of here and on my way very soon 
 break it down to me whats going on 
 thats me 
 barnes 
 just dont move around too much 
 its getting hard to breathe 
 will you shut up already 
 we are going to die 
 dont say that it aint over till its over 
 whats the usewe are gonna die 
 i dont have a problem with it besides you get to meet a lot of interesting people 
 well more power to you me i start to bug out after too much time out here 
 not me im in for the long haul in nine months i will have enough to take a few years off 
 welli dont mind i can put up with it im taking six months off after this and i wont have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me 
 like that piece of ass he was with 
 no but it buys a lot of other things 
 yeah i guess money dont buy class 
 look at thisjesus 
 i dont know wave to them 
 what is it 
 try not to think about it 
 right now its about N oclock at home people are going to work kids are going to school 
 good in that case i pronounce us man and wife 
 in that case i accept 
 it would matter to us 
 i would but no one can perform the ceremony i guess it doesnt matter 
 thats right will you marry me 
 marry you 
 will you marry me 
 except write our wills 
 it did it is theres nothing we can do about that 
 i never thought this would happen no premonitions nothing 
 and so far 
 so close 
 we dont have time i will explain later hurry 
 what do you mean what happened 
 we have room lets go 
 what the hell are you doing 
 over and out 
 sooner than later 
 hopefully sooner than later 
 thanks for everything taylor will i see you again 
 im staying with the ship i will be all right now hurry 
 so whats going to happen to you 
 i will do my best 
 uh its ok everythings going to be oknow im counting on you and whatever you do keep calm we dont want them to panic 
 how does the distress signal look 
 hurry you have to get them out of there 
 im about to blow the wall 
 hes out of the equation talk to me 
 barnes 
 im in the bridge 
 taylor where are you 
 dawn come in 
 you too 
 i will once i get past the bulkhead good luck 
 i cant 
 but you cant be sure its suicide you have to come with us 
 dont worry about me theres still a chance i can issue a distress signal 
 but how are you going to escape 
 im going to try and buy you some time i can get to the bridge from here 
 and what are you going to do 
 theres only room on that pod for seven thats you and the others im counting on you to get them out of there 
 what what are you talking about 
 im not going with you 
 why where are you going 
 a little dab will do ya now you know how to get there right 
 no 
 a flare a flare wont do it 
 take this flare 
 thats why we need a safe passage remember what you said earlier about getting through the wall that might just be our ticket 
 we dont have enough suits to get the others out 
 a schematic of the ship looking for a lifeline to the pods 
 whats that 
 the room is filled with poison gas the hydraulic system must have blown 
 oh my god what happened 
 it was no time to lose my partner we are going to have to hurry hes on to us 
 i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude you saved my life 
 helllp 
 dawn dawn 
 words to live by 
 dont worry about what will happen just concentrate on what is happening you will live longer 
 sure 
 do you want some advice 
 yeah but you didnt answer my question 
 well dawn im an optimist by nature 
 what do you thinks going to happen to us 
 yeah 
 taylor 
 one of barnes duds luckily for us take this out of the equation right now 
 explosive 
 dont worry about me where are we going 
 be careful you dont want to puncture the suit 
 at this point im ready for anything 
 you are ready for the real thing 
 so we did 
 yeah we did it 
 ready as i will ever be 
 are you ready 
 i understand 
 i dont know what we are facing 
 simulated space walking 
 look i know what im doing i have experience and training in space walking 
 i cant let you do that 
 wait 
 everyone just stay put 
 even if we do it might be too late 
 if i could get to the bridge i could send the distress signal 
 yeah lets hope he can find a way through 
 it must be oxygenated if we can hear him 
 close every door behind you 
 he certainly is polite 
 you are right 
 we could send mac if he can retrieve one suit we could go back for the other 
 suppose you didnt have to hold your breath 
 and suppose you couldnt hold out 
 i dont know the condition of the compartments depending on damage debriscould be a fatal mistake 
 why cant we 
 damn it if only we could get to those suits dawn then thinks of something 
 great 
 sure it complies with all standard construction codes 
 seen one like it before 
 okits open 
 with what how am i going to interface with it i need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me 
 cant we access the mainframe to check the ships condition 
 it depends on the condition of the ship if i could get to one of the suit compartments i could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry 
 supposing we could get out of this room is there anything we could do to reach the bridge 
 just considering our options sir 
 i dont think you know what you are talking about besides what could we use for tools a steak knife a corkscrew 
 well maybe we can do something like that 
 probably come through the wall i suppose 
 given a malfunction how would a rescue team get you out if the doors wont open 
 fat chance of that even if we had cN and a laser torch these doors wouldnt budge that son of a bitchthat stupid son of a bitch 
 well maybe theres a way out of here 
 we dont 
 i dont know 
 what are we going to do 
 still i hope i behave on the moon i will stick close to you 
 really 
 actually i have logged about N hours of simulated space walking at the institute mostly related to starship construction 
 im sure you will be all right 
 well i hope i dont do anything careless 
 well i dont think theres a chance of that happening its usually the moon walks sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher 
 like open an airlock by mistake 
 well let me put it this way most of the cost is due to safety reasons most people are not familiar with space travel so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless 
 well plus the money aint that bad dawn so tell me do you think everyone gets their million dollars worth on this trip of a lifetime 
 so you were looking for a new challenge 
 this is my second commercial flight i used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast 
 yes theoretical discoveries aside theres nothing like the real thing how about you 
 ryan taylor first mate welcome aboard first time in space 
 thats right 
 oh right right you are on that research grant 
 that is one of my priorities 
 yes mac but the guests are requesting it it will reduce the level of negative feedback 
 well if you need anything please feel free to ask me just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available N hours in the earthrise room and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar 
 so i have been told 
 well theres no better to way to see the world than with us 
 no just enjoying the view

 the pin machine 
 did you hear about that bowler who got smeared i saw them pull a body bag out of the alley i heard he was kacked but good they had to take apart the pin machine to get him out 
 maybe i should have left the ball in the car 
 my father used to say to me never no hmmm always no no ah love and hate are blood relations 
 yeah but it didnt go so good he wasnt the man i thought hed be theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup but his hands are trembling spilling some of the coffee

 bowling was the most incorruptible sport no megalomillionaires no

 i hate fuckin opera 
 la da da dalala 
 bowling used to be so pure soall american breeze sings along with caruso and pretends to conduct 
 so buzz lets skedaddle mr kastle is waiting as buzz gets up theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs 
 your pop said to put these on his tab sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door

 yeah and make it extra muddy i didnt sleep a zee last night sheila fills a cup buzz lifts it to his mouth his hands trembling 
 wish me luck

 you never even took the shot you couldnt do it theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner 
 thats right buzz and you know when i did it last match last frame all i needed was one spare for the crown and i get stuck with the seventen the fazeli split

 buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins sid and breeze throw sideways glances at each other 
 if junior thinks you are doing the bouncy bouncy with his sister hes gonna tap dance on your spleen 
 hey enough fun and games we have work to do come on junior kastle heads for his car junior gets up and follows the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands 
 if i find out buzz is comin up short on dwarf bowling its lights out for him and pink slips for you sid and breeze look sideways at each other 
 someone gonna get kacked boss 
 its not an alley i hate when people call it a bowling alley its so common i prefer bowling center 
 weird comes into alleys and doesnt bowl 
 he killed your stoolie embezzler father and hes gonna kill you next sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowds murmur increases kastle turns and yells over his shoulder 
 wheres junior 
 i think buzz is retiring soon in fact i think hes retiring tonight kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila 
 you already have a partner mr kastle sheila walks over as the sleazeballs car pulls out of the driveway 
 i like you theo you bowl with soul 
 why would you help me

 i like the sport the way it is 
 theres a lot of competition for amusement out there you gotta adapt to survive 
 what ever happened to just bowling 
 rac rac renovate automate computerize that my boy is the future one of the monitors shows a little girl bowling her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike the little girl jumps with joy 
 hes earned an early retirement but enough about losers buzz fazeli is history lets talk about your future i wanna show you something 
 what if he wants to get out 
 if it springs a leak it will be because buzz is making waves 
 nice setup 
 profits down there philanthropy up here besides it beats the pants off bingo 
 think of this business like a big aquarium you gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top 
 thats right didnt you have a slight control problem in a recent tournamentchamp now go take out your big four darling come on we are making her nervous 
 thats some pinfall almost a N average her balls flat she needs to work on her spin control 
 its nothing just a slight business imbalance hows glorias thumb 
 whats with the bad air between you two mr kastle 
 maybe i can help you try a lighter ball penelope you will get hurt with that big ball honey i have seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit you got fazeli blood running through you your pop was a genuine talent in his day 
 you might say im at the top of their shit list 
 i heard you have been having a little trouble with the congress theo pulls his eyes off sheila kastle walks theo past pairs of bowlers 
 nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without miles kastle knowing about it you dont mind if i have a word with theo do you bunny kastle takes theo by the elbow and pulls him away 
 you know who i am 
 so you are buzzs boy i have been expecting you you hurt my feelings when you didnt come and see me sooner 
 bowling center

 just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you doesnt mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that sheila and kastle sit up 
 leave him alone 
 look whos talking 
 you are using theo for your own deviant purposes 
 she ran away to be with that that motocross champion 
 thats why mom ran away because you had to control everything 
 you are just like you mother always jealous 
 he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid crushed all the nerve endings junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand 
 after we eat dad 
 see no feeling tell theo what happened to your hand junior 
 i bet you didnt know that you and junior have something in common theo junior cant bowl anymore either isnt that right junior kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on juniors right hand the table settings jump from the shock junior sits impassively his face a blank 
 ssssh now real quiet on three onetwothree 
 dad this is ridiculous just open it 
 four or five years when a girl like thats bowling on the pro tour for team kastle she will pay a handsome profit on my investment 
 she hit it mr kastle

 like this 
 now swing it out a little to the right 
 yeah 
 line up where you want it 
 grasp firmly then what 
 thats right sugar find the grip thats right for you then grasp firmly the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a minigreen 
 i just hold it loosely with both hands 
 the peter pan 
 where can i find him 
 careful with that one he wont tell me anything but i know theres something strange going on over at the lanes if you ask me id say the old fart wants to die 
 hes no father to you

 what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum huh 
 sshheeiillaaa 
 now hes the one whos locked up and im the one whos free if i gotta do this alone i might as well start now she revs up and peals out 
 i have been trapped by miles kastle my whole life she walks over to her scooter and mounts it 
 back to plan a the vicious cycle all over again theo lets go of sheila 
 i didnt come this far to bury a guy thats not my dad he owes me 
 theo buzz is dead 
 plan c from now on its gonna be plan c both bodies throb and grind their sandy hands sliding over each others sweaty skin 
 say something theo give me something a dolls legs catch fire theo stares into sheilas eyes 
 at least i will die smiling 
 you dont get two chances with junior 
 i killed him once i will just have to kill him again 
 if junior finds us he will kill us both 
 when im with you sheila i dont even think about bowling theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately she stops him and looks around nervously 
 why did you come back 
 i did your dirty work for you sheila now fuck off theo drives away leaving sheila standing alone she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression then turns on her heel 
 can i come with you 
 i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz he gets into his car 
 where are you going

 more than you could afford 
 how much would you charge me for the lips 
 i may not be a pro bowler but im no amateur man sheila moves closer to theo

 do it norman its the only choice we have this thing is gonna crush us 
 dont pull it norman it will start a fire we cant stop norman 
 do you see it 
 dont do it norman 
 its either that or we grow gills 
 thats our reserve air 
 increase positive pressure 
 hes right beneath us 
 what was that 
 why cant i what the hell is going on here 
 where is it 
 what are you saying we cant stop whats out there 
 thirty yards 
 sure each time it started fires inside the habitat 
 but you have tested it 
 forty yards 
 it sends N volts throughout the cylinder surface but we have never used it underwater before 
 high voltage 
 we are a habitat not a castle the only defense we have is high voltage 
 what do we use for defense 
 fifty yards and closing 
 what if it attacks 
 a squid the size of a whale i dont think so target acquired sixty yards 
 what was that 
 directions east coming 
 shut up beth i dont want to hear it 
 nice work captain sir 
 you are a fucking biochemist arent you cant you tell us something 
 im not sure i have never seen anything like it 
 nobody move 
 but shes 
 nobody move 
 forgive me i have never read the navy manual i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures 
 there are procedures beth that i want followed my procedures and considering whats going on i want you to follow them very closely 
 yeah i heard you 
 back at the door i asked you to back away 
 two and a half days 
 they told me about sixty hours 
 how long will that be 
 the surface ships will be back after the storm clears 
 edmunds do you have a N on norman 
 norman 
 what are you his mother get norman i want everyone ready to go edmunds the subs 
 i am not leaving without him do you hear me we come down as a team we leave as a team 
 yeasts thank you beth but i dont think we are gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread 
 not everything even on earth take yeasts 
 how about i just press the button 
 alright beth do that thing you did before 
 any of you get ahead of me walk this far up 
 what is it 
 hold on 
 would you wait a minute 
 i said back away 
 wait a minute 
 back away then 
 theres heat coming the door 
 basic english theres no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet 
 in basic english what does all this mean 
 of what we are able to measure roughly twentysix hundred feet 
 how big is this spacecraft 
 pull it 
 i see it 
 you see the lever on the green box upper right hand corner 
 yes sir im here 
 ted go into the control room listen for my instructions 
 jerry please stop this 
 what the hell it shut us down 
 jerry 
 going active 
 no i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat he might be listening now 
 maybe so but i think we need to ask jerry about it 
 bullshit whats out there isnt alien its an animal 
 yes i do whatevers out there i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier 
 you think he killed edmunds 
 but sir i think its imperative i think the messages the animals we have seen what killed edmunds the reading you got earlier i think they are all related 
 i dont want you talking to jerry 
 at least our obituaries will be accurate thats reassuring 
 if something should happen to us the navy will at least have partial records of what happened 
 what for 
 edmunds can you copy 
 it raises a very serious question what happens if jerry gets mad 
 damn it edmunds 
 because if jerry is powerful and also emotional 
 edmunds 
 i think we should be careful consider his emotional response 
 you dont think weapons are important 
 thats smart lets talk about guns and violence 
 great okay ask him about his weapons 
 what am i a dog now 
 the message doesnt show a lack of intelligence its smart its approaching us in a simple way like you would a dog holding out your hand letting it sniff get used to you 
 he translated it wrong my name is jerry its like see spot run 
 without a cautionary word to anyone you know ted said something to me earlier i think hes right he said when you got a guy who if he wasnt here hed be standing in the unemployment line you gotta question if you got the right guy 
 i didnt know it would come to this 
 and then brought her down here 
 wait a second 
 you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation 
 at the time i dont know i thought putting her on the list it might help her career catch her a break 
 so you knew this when you wrote your report 
 N i think she tried again five years ago i thought you should know 
 when was this 
 she put a razor to her wrists a day later 
 she should have known better 
 a while back beth and i we worked at the same university she was assisting a chemist there i forget his name doing research experiments she was also living with him yeah i know and when she finished her work he kicked her out broke off the relationship and published five papers all her work without any thank you or acknowledgement 
 i think i do 
 you dont want to know 
 how drastic 
 im not paranoid i know beth she can be drastic 
 no buts if he wants to be left we will leave him hello yes the subs i want a report hello yes a report gimme shit 
 but sir 
 i told you people nobody goes anywhere unless i say 
 you cant just leave harry down here sir 
 hes here somewhere find him the subs on its way go cmon 
 hes missing hes gone he left 
 what do you mean hes missing 
 harrys missing 
 just worry about yourself 
 all im saying is someone should keep an eye on him 
 look the ships are clearing out they are taking us topside in a matter of minutes someone can check him out there if its that imprtant 
 im telling you harrys lost it hes saying theres a deathwish out for each of us 
 dont get hysterical norman 
 everything can be killed 
 i dont know thats the point 
 you mean whats in that thing is immortal 
 or maybe it cant be killed 
 like thou shall not kill 
 if it is alien maybe we shouldnt try to open it at all 
 what 
 maybe we shouldnt 
 i dont know but its something alien 
 picked up something what is it 
 take a look 
 what is it norman 
 its a corrosive gas on earth it makes a halfeaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly iron rust on an oldsmobile at a pressure this low oxygen becomes toxic breathe it down here and it will do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile 
 whats wrong with oxygen 
 they pressurize us with helium 
 but sir i dont understand this report these recommendations they are for an encounter with extra terrestrial life 
 your reports become our bible down here dr johnson we have been carrying out each of your recommendations one by one to the smallest detail 
 ulf report nobodys mentioned that in years you mean someone actually read it 
 the one you recommended in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration 
 what team 
 we think it might thats why we brought you here we have assembled your team they are waiting for us now 
 it doesnt make any sense 
 off the record i dont mind telling you this thing scares the shit out of me 
 im afraid it is dr johnson because its sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor 
 its impossible 
 extraordinary isnt it 
 theres got to be some mistake here a four hundred year old military spacecraft theres no such thing our space program isnt even forty years old 
 maybe older 
 hold on 
 dating the crash at least that old 
 wait a second 
 coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year 
 geologists 
 see this coral geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick 
 as best we can estimate it crashed four hundred years ago 
 not really no something of the military crashes in the ocean it explains why there was nothing on the news why you have kept everything a secret when did it crash 
 something like that that doesnt surprise you 
 what is it a military spacecraft like a shuttle or satellite 
 what do you need me for 
 what 
 then why am i here 
 survivors no i wouldnt think so 
 a thousand an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water i dont want to sound pessimistic here but i assume there are no survivors 
 a thousand feet 
 how deep is he 
 they didnt tell me anything 
 a cyclones on its way in i thought they would have told you on the phone 
 storm what storm 
 we are moving fast considering the storm 
 well we dont have all the facts yet 
 from what whats with all the security 
 good securitys been our biggest worry now that you are here we can shut this thing down tight 
 press no i havent 
 you talk to any reporters any press 
 nothing else 
 anything else 
 the usual plane crash survivers unknown routine stuff really 
 what have you been told so far 
 what team 
 come with me the teams already waiting 
 the pentagon i didnt know i had friends in washington 
 dont thank me dr johnson you werent my choice the pentagon made me take you 
 well thanks for the opportuninty here my wife appreciates it 
 captain right forgive me 
 captain 
 thank you colonel 
 in a minute sir 
 edmunds get in here i need you for this 
 if the subs arent here yet sir 
 norman get out of there now norman 
 sir sir the door its opening 
 they have left keep watching 
 sir if the subs havent left by now 
 in the ship sir 
 well where the fuck is he 
 yes sir 
 what the hell is going on here 
 nothing sir 
 fuck him what hello 
 nothing sir 
 any sign of harry 
 they are coming 
 im getting no sub reading sir 
 send them damn it i know but im not gonna be held responsible 
 subs are still at surface sir 
 harry can you copy 
 get him out of there i thought i told you people 
 nothing i dont know everything was normal no changes at all 
 what caused it 
 well shit find something do something make something up 
 we dont have anything else to try sir 
 thank you i can see that try something else 
 its not sucking sir 
 working on it now sir 
 can you open that panel 
 if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic 
 she wired this system 
 shes not gonna know 
 edmunds get in here i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted 
 what you want me to retype it 
 with an o harold with an o 
 im in charge 
 hes saying take me to your leader he wants to know whos in charge 
 what 
 shes not gonna know sir 
 not now beth please i want to know who we are talking to before we start talking wheres edmunds 
 he understands me fine 
 are you enjoying yourself harry because i dont know what the hell you are doing 
 its not ignorant 
 ignorant the things ignorant 
 how do you mean strange 
 i have to tell you its strange 
 whats the message 
 spiralling out of the center you see g is one b is two h is three and so on when i got the message 
 we are all very proud of you harry but what the hell is it 
 its a single sequence repeated over and over 
 please watch your closest monitor 
 who is that wheres that coming from 
 ladies and gentlemen 
 gimme a report i want 
 just tell me worst case worst case of what we might find 
 lets say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us just like we are to say medieval europe suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set there wouldnt be any place to plug it in 
 you dont know that 
 it could but the odds of it being any use to us are against it 
 or it could contain some great benefit to us some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind 
 its nonsense theres enough difference between our own species to prove that 
 so whats the problem 
 the what 
 man is man all he knows is man and all he can think of is what he knows the anthropomorphic problem good norman 
 ted seems to have some ideas 
 so how do we get it open 
 a break for what 
 to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere 
 what 
 no they dont represent a message they arent decorative at all they have another purpose entirely 
 so do we and it seems to have picked up something on its travels 
 we know how this craft got here where its been 
 yes harry 
 ted captain 
 then how can it be chipped 
 i did 
 i thought you said there wasnt any damage done in the crash 
 i dont know how it can be chipped but its chipped 
 chipped the door how can it be chipped 
 its chipped 
 im not saying anything harry im just stating the facts the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy built into an epoxy resin honeycomb the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented 
 right so you are saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch 
 to the craft none not a scratch 
 how much damage 
 in the dome hanger all our tapes are transferred to the sub its on a N hour timer if someone doesnt reset the delay button the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes 
 what sub 
 resetting the sub 
 what was edmunds doing outside 
 well until we know exactly what it is nobody goes outside understood 
 too big 
 it wont register its too big to image 
 what 
 the sensors are picking up something outside 
 what is that 
 dont make stuff up these emotional theories just so you can feel important here 
 edmunds 
 give him a chance hes speaking our language not the other way around 
 its not talking its mimicking 
 i am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named jerry 
 captain i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions 
 i want a name a real name this things full name rank and serial number 
 whats inside the sphere 
 from the sphere 
 get out of there i dont want anyone going anywhere outside understood 
 she says jellyfish are a delicacy you know i never knew that 
 internal power 
 to what 
 they switched us over 
 we are on the bottom of the fucking ocean he cant just walk outside 
 sir about leaving 
 how can he be missing 
 ted shut up are you packed ready to go i want everyone packed now 
 did you hear me sir because 
 what no i know they are civilians 
 can i stay sir im willing to risk it i am after what we just witnessed 
 maybe its a message of some sort you know see this red here 
 but what does it do this sphere 
 maybe we didnt want to come back 
 what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back 
 time travel i always thought it was one of those myths like santas reindeer 
 considered what that its american how would you think its american 
 we had considered it 
 what do you make of this 
 whats wrong 
 a foot and a half thick thatd withstand a helluva lot of radiation 
 radiation shield you think 
 some sort of lead or something 
 what is it 
 look at this 
 what are you going to do shoot her 
 ted get her away from the door 
 what if we go out there you know wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open 
 what about a crowbar 
 duly noted ted edmunds try using suction 
 id also like it noted 
 nobody goes inside until we know whats inside 
 captain you know i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television 
 the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we have seen 
 a half a mile long 
 down below harry said we would all have to die since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible and we all knew then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone death was the only logical explanation but sitting here we still know so how is that possible unless we make ourselves forget 
 hows that 
 yes and i think we already know it will 
 would it work 
 get away 
 beth 
 get away from me 
 hear what 
 you hear that 
 what 
 what is that what are you doing 
 lets get out of here beth lets go home 
 top shelf is it 
 cmon 
 oh sure here anything else beth can get you some more chicken perhaps let beth check the fridge 
 beth gimme the gun 
 dont tell me about me i already know too much 
 i 
 oh please dont shrink me norman not now 
 i know you are too strong beth 
 you cant stop it norman you cant fight me 
 leave me alone norman 
 beth 
 its you norman your fear of drowning you have to face it 
 stop it 
 from you norman from your mind you are doing it 
 then wheres it coming from

 beth stop it 
 dont you know 
 where is it coming from beth 
 you are frightened arent you norman 
 beth 
 im not fucking with you norman you have fucked yourself 
 dont fuck with me beth 
 of course you are going to deny it you want to blame someone else you want to blame beth because you hate beth 
 get away from the door beth 
 this is what im talking about norman dont you see its in you this vindictiveness this rage 
 you think i care you think i care if i die would i put explosives around the habitat set on vibration sensors that can trigger automatically if i cared about myself would i i have tried twice before norman why wouldnt i try a third time im not thinking about myself no norman im thinking about you your safety protecting you from your own self 
 its not safe for you to be either 
 its your choice because its not safe for you to be awake to be walking around to be thinking about things 
 its either this or i kill you 
 dont beth please 
 you think id belive you believe anything you might say now after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past about my problems my problems not yours not his mine 
 beth 
 promise what norman tell me 
 i promise 
 but i have to norman 
 dont beth 
 its not me beth its not me it cant be im not doing anything just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle 
 its not me beth i swear it cant be 
 im not scaring you am i norman i hope im not frightening you the last thing i want to do is frighten you you feel okay dont you 
 when you were in that sub and that squid was attacking you are you sure it was the squid that was attacking do you know i cant get beth on the radio im in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean all alone surrounded by all this water was it really the squid that was attacking you norman or was it something else one of your fears you never really saw what it was did you 
 shut up beth 
 no it isnt your name is norman but your younger brother what was his name the one who was stung when you were younger the one that died the one you couldnt save what was his name mommy we are going out to the ocean to go swimming but i dont want to go swimming norman im scared cmon harry it will be fine it will be fun you heartless fuck thats why you are so scared of the water isnt it 
 beth the message said harry my name is harry my name isnt harry 
 is it 
 thats bullshit 
 you remember before you picked him up when you looked up at the sphere you remember that when the sphere opened thats right but you cant remember going inside can you no of course not harry couldnt either could he like everythings on the tip of my tongue he said 
 yes 
 you dont remember you did but im sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry dont you you remember that 
 i never went in that sphere 
 am i or am i making so much sense that you are going insane 
 you are insane 
 did i or was that you when you were hiding in the bathroom all conspiratorially like you were you became frightened didnt you terrified like you were with the snake earlier and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor you did that norman 
 you manifested that beth 
 one lonely terrifying sea snake 
 thats when you went in the sphere 
 and the snakes you want to know about the snakes you saw one outside earlier didnt you when you thought i had deserted you you were terrified 
 but 
 am i lying are you sure are you absolutely sure im lying then explain to me about the jellyfish earlier why did we see jellyfish harry doesnt fear jellyfish you do they are your fear arent they 
 you are lying 
 cmon what 
 beth you are losing it cmon 
 yes someone did but it wasnt me norman it was you you manifested the snakes 
 someone did 
 you think i manifested the snakes 
 then why beth why go in why put out explosives why manifest the snakes 
 no he cant 
 he cant manifest 
 no he isnt 
 against what harrys unconscious hes not a threat 
 same reason i put explosives around the habitat for defense for the power to protect myself 
 why did you go in the sphere beth 
 whats the phrase keeping up with the joneses 
 did you 
 if i was then i would have had to have gone in the sphere wouldnt i 
 are you manifesting them 
 dont you 
 do you fear them 
 you tell me 
 what are they doing down here in the bathroom suddenly appearing 
 am i afraid of them not during the day sea snakes are diurnal when the suns out they dont bite fortunately for you i had on my watch this is quite good 
 you know what i mean 
 snakes what do you mean exactly 
 how do you feel about snakes 
 i did do that didnt i 
 you put explosives around the habitat i cant imagine what youd put in a drink 
 you dont think i put something in it do you 
 you think id really drink that 
 its getting cold 
 are you 
 im feeling better 
 whats wrong norman 
 oh yes my watch i almost forgot 
 your watch 
 what was that i couldnt hear you 
 hows harry 
 the grooves around the door they have shifted and the pattern the fluids they look darker now 
 what do you mean different 
 the sphere looks different 
 in the sub resetting the timer why 
 where are you 
 what is it norman 
 you are not sorry you are scared you are a psychologist norman you pride yourself on knowing when someones lying to you not telling you the truth and now you are scared because you are not sure you can tell anymore 
 not believing you 
 for what 
 im sorry 
 only lab rats here 
 thirty years ago in residency i passed out you 
 you ever given an injection before 
 look its either him or us norman another attack and we go down with this place 
 you want to kill him 
 to be on the safe side i mean 
 beth 
 its an idea 
 what if it takes N minutes norman what if it takes an hour and he can fight it off we cant afford that 
 doesnt say 
 how fast does it take effect 
 what wait isnt that dangerous 
 i will just boost the doses 
 three to six hours 
 how long does it last 
 N ccs of parasolutrine in combination with N ccs of paracin given iv produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures no cardiac side effects rem activity is surpressed 
 used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride 
 its like a sleeping pill 
 causes sleep 
 whats that 
 its a soporific 
 paraso 
 how do you spell it 
 parasolutrine 
 antibiotic 
 damn it chloramphenicol 
 antihistamine for bites 
 riordan 
 and may also cause bizarre halucinations 
 bingo 
 tranquilizer causes drowsiness 
 tarazine 
 nothing about drowsiness 
 does it cause drowsiness thats all we need to get him unconscious put him under 
 a synthetic opium analogue 
 sintag 
 ulcers 
 valdomet 
 its for motion sickness 
 ephedrine hydrochloride 
 something for burns 
 diphenyl parlene 
 why would harry go back to using a code 
 looks like some sort of code 
 must be and if it is its a part of him not even he can control 
 and thats the part of harry thats being manifested 
 no i mean we have always believed we can think anything we want without consequences you ever read the bible it talks about our sinful nature you know i mean we can think and believe and desire whatever we want but theres a part of us a shadow side as jung called it that cant be controlled its evil its inside us its what we are 
 his dream you cant control your dreams and you cant control your fears can you 
 he must not realize he is like the navy crewman harry was sleeping then he must have manifested his dream 
 but why is he doing it 
 its his fear the squid hes manifesting his fears making them real 
 which i told barnes was attacking 
 i dont know beth im not the fucking alien that built the thing but it can when harry came out of the sphere he mumbled something about page N how he would never read that far he was too scared to then you found the book remember in your lab then in the cafeteria and page N talks about a giant squid 
 how can the sphere do that 
 i dont know 
 but how 
 he acquired some sort of power a power to manifest things 
 you think in the sphere 
 when did the messages start the animals outside start showing up after harry came out of the sphere 
 what do you mean a part of harry 
 remember when we first spoke to jerry barnes kept asking for jerrys real name but harry never would he didnt because he was afraid the screen would say harry instead of jerry we werent talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry we were talking to harry or a part of harry 
 what 
 he translated it wrong 
 created brought to life i dont know but at the end jerry said stop calling me jerry and 
 manifested 
 after the attack a navy guy woke me up i dont know i thought he was an illusion but i checked the tape and jerry said he manifested him 
 according to calculations of some naturalists one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles N feet long that would make a formidable monster 
 squids 
 our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long some skeletons of squids 
 page N i could never read that far 
 what 
 page N 
 damn it norman hes lying dont you get it there is something seriously fucked up going on here and hes causing it why cant you believe me 
 i dont know beth i wasnt there 
 you think its me you think im saying there was a conversation when there wasnt 
 this being after you so carefully fixed my suit 
 damn it norman i swear i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up 
 all i know is i opened that refridgerator 
 you dont believe me 
 you think 
 no it wasnt i swear none of this was here none of it you think he hid it earlier he must have hid it 
 did you look it was on the top shelf 
 none of this was here before 
 N deepsea delivery i hear they are good

 i dont trust harry to do it 
 in case you die too 
 you should know how it works just in case 
 why should i go 
 maybe you should go to the sub 
 get the helium out of our bloodstream we go to the surface now wed pop like a soda bottle 
 four days 
 we cant the storm the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here and we have four days of decompression when we get up top 
 wake him then lets go get outta 
 you me and harry hes asleep 
 you me and harry 
 its also our only way out of here it holds three people and theres only three of us left now 
 its not worth the risk 
 dont bother me norman 
 forget the sub 
 i have to reset the sub 
 where are you going in such a hurry 
 no i should stay calm like you say right norman stay calm 
 beth 
 yeah okay sure norman 
 beth i didnt hold it together alright 
 you bastard 
 dont do this 
 you did didnt you 
 beth 
 you told him about me 
 what 
 you said something to him didnt you 
 its done alright its over and theres not a damn thing we can do about it now okay 
 dont tell me to calm down 
 calm down beth alright 
 hes not just a navy captain he works for the fucking pentagon 
 you went through edmunds things 
 in edmunds things 
 where did you get this 
 although advised of risks all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft signed barnes usn 
 fuck you norman its right here 
 you are jumping to conclusions beth dont get worked up 
 so who was barnes talking to at the last minute nobody 
 so what 
 yeah he told you think what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose he was on the phone except that cable is a thousand feet long norman they would have broken off communication with us four five minutes before they cleared out 
 cmon beth dont make this personal he told me himself they were taking us back 
 he lied to us he left us down here 
 eggs 
 what are they 
 norman 
 what could have done this 
 she was crushed feel her skin its like sandpaper 
 i cant feel her bones shes like a sponge 
 beth 
 i didnt do anything wrong i didnt mean 
 beth 
 nobody said norman what why are you looking at me like that 
 beth 
 what wait dont why are you 
 they are or they arent which is it 
 i mean im not i wasnt absolutely sure if they 
 beth 
 what why 
 and you didnt tell anyone 
 yeah why 
 you knew about the squid not being normal before fletcher went out there 
 what 
 wait a minute 
 they have six tentacles a new species and the squid too they had no stomach 
 what do you mean not normal 
 normally id say no everythings quiet now no ships no divers no electricity makes sense but whats curious is these arent normal jellyfish 
 me well i was wrapped in seaweed it itched for a while but i survived beth do you find it curious that we are seeing all this life down here nothing and then these enormous flocks of squid then jellyfish 
 what about you what happened to you 
 yeah it was awful 
 my gosh norman 
 when i was six my younger brother and i we went swimming in the pacific at my mothers beach house we both felt stinging and when we came out of the water he was wearing jellyfish head to toe killed him 
 no thank you i hate jellyfish 
 a bad one it was the only book in there norman come here look at this 
 we have a library 
 the library 
 whered this come from 
 disrupt our brain waves interfere with our ability to think 
 it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas 
 get this thing off me 
 norman 
 good theory ted 
 N years ago im sure christopher columbus would have loved these accomodations 
 such a gentlemen when you are scared shitless 
 no go ahead really ladies first 
 you are next norman 
 yeah drowning 
 isnt there a psychological term for that dr johnson 
 what are you threatening me 
 just keep your mouth shut alright this could mean everything to our careers you know that dont jeopardize this 
 the timing has never seemed quite right 
 well lets pray thats the only mistake you made have you said anything to barnes about this 
 it never occurred to me 
 well you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here in the ocean N percent of the earths surface is water norman thats first grade geography 
 we cant go down there we are not prepared that deep that takes years of training beth we are just scientists lab scietists we wear ties and lab coats to work not oxygen tanks 
 what do you expect for them to bring it up here 
 underwater 
 to the spacecraft to investigate 
 wait down where 
 because when we get down there 
 cmon beth that reports like the blind leading the blind 
 do yourself a favor norman are you listening dont tell anyone what you just told me 
 i spent a week reading sagan and watching reruns of the twilight zone seriously i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house i had no idea 
 thats quite a secret 
 its bullshit the reports a joke 
 i have read it twice norman its brilliant 
 that ulf report everybodys patting me on the back about 
 i love secrets 
 beth look can i trust you with a little secret 
 who says its a he 
 he doesnt wait for an answer 
 by the bunks 
 norman wheres norman 
 im a woman i dont theorize i only deal with facts 
 well whats your theory 
 it doesnt make any sense 
 i dont get it 
 well they are not mine 
 well think because theres footprints here that arent mine 
 no i dont think so 
 whats that mistake number two norman 
 pussy 
 wont make any difference the tapes document everything 
 we can refuse to talk 
 they are going to want answers and they are going to keep asking until they get them 
 yes you are 
 no im not im not star 
 you are staring at me 
 like what im not 
 why are you looking at me like that 
 another attack 
 our habitat i mean this place cant handle another attack 
 just in time for what 
 what 
 in time for what 
 just in time too 
 yeah i dont know how you could make that confusion 
 im sorry slip of the tongue 
 thats a hell of a mistake to make beth 
 jerry right i said jerry didnt i 
 harry thats bullshit we stood right there 
 we never even had a conversation norman 
 yes you did norman i wouldnt leave you out there you know that 
 i never said that 
 when he woke up he said we were out of food he told me to get some from the ship 
 cannibalism to be extreme and now we are talking about a new life form their values and ethics may be incomprehensible 
 take politics our views on abortion the death penalty 
 a light switch a button opened that door the craft runs on some sort of power 
 what are you looking for 
 its an american spacecraft 
 then what is it 
 youd have to ask them 
 its empty why would someone build a ship like this 
 for whoevers in that thing 
 for who the fish 
 all that banging and pounding i dont know we should think about making a good first impression 
 pry the thing open what are we neanderthals 
 harry thinks its some sort of discharge from our own system but i have seen it discharge before and it didnt look anything like this 
 is it coming from our own computer 
 no idea we have no surface support it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater 
 wheres it coming from 
 minutes ago harrys trying to decode it in his room now 
 when did it come across 
 it would erase all our knowledge of it all of our power 
 you mean forget 
 the power allows us to manifest our fears right what if we feared the power to go away 
 we all kill ourselves bad joke sorry beth 
 there is one possibility 
 no i dont but i always said to myself when i die i want to die laughing 
 good thank you now that i have it on why are you laughing you dont even know what that means 
 hows that working out by the way 
 its not fast enough norman theres a helluva lot of explosive down there 
 nine hundred feet to surface 
 less than a minute we are never gonna make it 
 wait 
 well press something 
 no idea 
 you know how to work this thing 
 im trying there 
 get her out of the seat i need room to sit harry 
 you got her 
 her legs are in the way 
 just pull her down like inside harry work with me here 
 gimme a second 
 im trying to keep balance with 
 cmon norman 
 shut up and catch 
 three fiftysix three fiftyfive three 
 i heard i heard 
 hurry norman four minutes 
 hold on 
 are you trying damn it just 
 missed 
 im trying shit here catch her 
 push her cmon 
 hold on 
 i cant reach her 
 how far aways the sub 
 two and a half minutes once we are in the sub 
 how much time you figure to get to the surface 
 shut up and open the door 
 we are never gonna make it 
 help me lift her 
 fine 
 i could hit her a little harder more toward the cranium 
 i dont think so 
 did i kill her 
 stop what what are you 
 its the squid stop it 
 you know what it is harry 
 what is it 
 is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag 
 thats right 
 the three of us 
 we just figured you know the three of us we need to work together through this 
 dont have to watch it will do it for you 
 how do we decode it 
 navy transmission they are sent from wisconsin 
 wisconsin 
 wisconsins your answer 
 shes lying norman just like she lied about fixing your suit 
 but why would she 
 i was just in the cafeteria theres plenty of food in there take a look for yourself 
 you didnt say that about the food 
 shes cracking norman 
 i thought she was with you 
 beth left 
 her suits gone 
 she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me 
 when i woke up nobody was here 
 what do you mean shes not here 
 what happened to her 
 thank you my suit beth said she fixed it 
 you are clear you see the airlock 
 i cant breathe am i clear 
 norman where are you 
 harry 
 you there norman 
 i dont remember much its like my memory is on the tip of my tongue but i cant taste any of it funny my senses are much keener though purer hearing seeing smelling like i can smell your sheets norman you tried to wash it out earlier but i can still smell the urine dont worry im not going to tell the others its normal really isnt it in a crisis the stress the panic 
 you dont remember that 
 did i 
 you said something to me before about how we were all going to die 
 dont do this dont psychoanalyze me i hate squid period just like you hate jellyfish 
 have you looked outside jellyfish everywhere i hate jellyfish harry what happened in the cafeteria 
 theres some sort of pattern here it will take a minute 
 getting anywhere with those 
 what are they 
 these arent half bad fletcher you might have a second career coming 
 that far in what harry 
 i could never read that far i never wanted to 
 page N of what harry 
 what happens on page N have you ever read page N 
 what is it harry 
 norman 
 then explain it to me 
 you dont understand about the sphere 
 tell me about the door do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere harry 
 you were all supposed to leave you werent supposed to stay down here 
 you remember opening the door 
 what are you still doing here 
 harry can you tell me about the sphere 
 its like 
 what noise 
 what is that that noise 
 curious isnt it whats inside before i die id sure like to open it and see 
 its whats in that sphere isnt it harry whatever you think is in that thing you think its going to kill you 
 then what norman 
 no i didnt say that 
 you mean you think im cracking 
 look we are under a lot of pressure we are tired you are not thinking straight 
 am i 
 i cant if i had a minute to think maybe but i know you are wrong 
 gimme another explanation 
 i cant believe that harry 
 meaning we are never gonna get to the surface alive to tell anyone 
 meaning we are never gonna get the chance to tell anyone 
 so we know we know it went through a black hole we saw it norman when wed get to the surface wed tell someone about the black hole wouldnt we itd go in some report like some big discovery so in fifty years when they build that ship theyd make precautions for a black hole but they didnt the called it an unknown entry event 
 so what 
 on that flight recorder they called the black hole an unknown entry event they didnt know what a black hole was fifty years from now men are going to build that ship in a very tentative experimental way with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible 
 i dont follow you 
 a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible 
 not a clue 
 im completely serious there is something very important missing from that spacecraft you know what that is 
 dont be so optomistic harry 
 good point i dont know what you are talking about but good point 
 and we are just talking about three dimensional creatures what if its five or six or sevendimensional so dimensional that we couldnt even see it to kill it 
 everything ever written about extra terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human if it doesnt look human its a reptile or a big insect or something having human values human understanding 
 i mentioned it in my report didnt you read the report 
 our present 
 but on the way home they miss their turn go too far into the past 
 this spacecraft was designed to pick things up they see things they want these claws go out and bring it in they come across this this sphere find it interesting curious they draw it inside to take back home 
 which one let me get the list out 
 this answers one of our questions 
 time travel a black hole 
 to what 
 our answer 
 whatever i can do to help 
 nice work norman 
 look would you 
 cmon norman 
 wait a second i 
 cmon 
 no why dont 
 go ahead ladies first 
 im fine 
 you sound defensive 
 im not being defensive 
 dont be defensive 
 fine im fine 
 you holding up alright 
 what 
 how are you feeling norman 
 its like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer hed run screaming witchcraft and you couldnt explain it to him either modems microchips particle physics 
 dont gimme that psychology bullshit norman psychology isnt a science its superstition its a bunch of soft subjective theories without any hard data to back it up with an intellect like this emotions dont mean shit 
 thank you 
 good idea ted 
 we are friends 
 whatd you say 
 codes are for hiding information so its making a mistake its making a code without intending to i figured its probably substituting numbers for letters then i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard and since we are getting spirals i imagined the keyboard as a spiral so i translated it 
 see no code whatd i say 
 i asked myself why would the sphere be using a code if you are trying to communicate why use a code 
 yeah i will work on it too 
 if it is a message its probably a substitution code i will work on it 
 its not a discharge right edmunds you said before right so its gotta be a message 
 well if its a discharge 
 impotent im not impotent 
 salts good for you ted helps you from getting impotent 
 hey go easy on the salt will ya we are not a bunch of icy streets here 
 look closely that isnt writing those are grooves 
 looks like a design some writing maybe maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message 
 not where when N years ago from our future 
 arrived from where 
 it didnt fly here it arrived here 
 please it must have flown here 
 meaning it didnt land in the water 
 meaning 
 we take a weeny little wedge bang on it a couple of times and bust off a chunk of the metal yet any spacecraft even at a low velocity say N miles an hour crashes into the water its gonna be like hitting concrete it would crumple like paper but there isnt a dent to be seen anywhere not even a scratch 
 its been obvious from the start hasnt it captain thats why all the secrecy why no one was told about it 
 an american spacecraft half a mile long and buried N years yeah good theory harry 
 save your breath its not an alien spacecraft 
 if it is an alien spacecraft 
 do you 
 gimme a minute here i think i have got it 
 all the facts you need are right in front of you 
 unless this alien spacecraft was you know somehow presenting itself to americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable 
 think about it 
 why would this ship carry instructions in english 
 is it 
 but its impossible 
 a spacecraft half a mile long with N tonnes of coral on top of it someone went to a lot of trouble try again 
 is it some sort of joke like one of those hoaxes 
 you dont think it does i think its rather obvious 
 thats right 
 english 
 shutup ted you didnt notice shit keep hammering 
 alot like you know i noticed it before but i didnt 
 gimme some room here will you back off gimme some space 
 easy ted we are not mining gold 
 you are not afraid of the water are you norman 
 its just like swimming norman you know how to swim dont you 
 just one of normans many secrets 
 what is it harry 
 she told me what you said norman 
 norman thinks we shouldnt be going down thinks its a mistake 
 what does norman already know 
 to who arthur nothing nothing that norman doesnt already know 
 whatd you say to him 
 about the time paradox how we were all going to die that there was no way we would make it out of here alive 
 what was that sir 
 that whole time i couldnt stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier 
 they are in the sub sir waiting 
 beth and harry 
 the others sir 
 how are the others 
 they are topside we are ready to take you home sir 
 the ships 
 its over sir the storm has cleared 
 does this mean what i think it means 
 norman johnson 
 told me what 
 you mean they havent told you yet 
 what report 
 by the way sir i have read your report i think its brilliant 
 really 
 barnes hes very eager to meet you been calling us every half hour to see if you are arrived 
 captain who 
 captain barnes wants to see you right away sir 
 this way sir 
 no they didnt say 
 no other equipment scientific instruments 
 just that careful its heavy 
 any other bags dr johnson 
 what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash 
 strange isnt it in the middle of the ocean no less 
 geologists at a plane crash 
 physicists mathematicians geologists you name it 
 whos everyone 
 must be another johnson then been flying so many scientists out here cant keep everyone straight 
 know what 
 you mean you dont know 
 what report 
 huh 
 what report 
 well everybodys been talking about that report you wrote 
 you have heard of me 
 oh so you are that dr johnson 
 im in psychology was still am really just been a while i treat aircrash survivors 
 of course he did hes been isloated for N years he wants someone to talk to look you put a human being in isolation for four days they can become neurotic sometimes psychotic we are talking about N years here an alien that shows emotional responses i think we need to address him before he reacts further 
 jerry isnt hostile norman he said earlier we were his friends 
 im not sure 
 you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds with whats out there 
 not that i know of why 
 has harry spoken with jerry 
 barnes didnt know couldnt get a reading 
 what was it 
 whys that 
 frankly ted id be much happier if jerry was just a cold emotionless intellect 
 when he uses a phrase like i am happy i think we should think twice about what we ask him 
 you want to put him on your couch norman grill him about his childhood 
 unless its an act 
 well hes polite 
 sure why not give him the trophy that pretentious son of a bitch you heard him norman all that someone went to a lot of trouble try again bullshit and impotent where does he get off saying im impotent hes a fucking selfrighteous little prick 
 well how about we wait and see what harry comes up with 
 inside the sphere look thats the vertical torso three legs two arms theres no head so im guessing the creatures head is located within the torso itself you know 
 the creature 
 dont you see it its a picture of the creature 
 this is like nursery school 
 try this one 
 please ted 
 squint harder 
 i dont see anything 
 take a look i rearranged the numbers put em up to the light go ahead squint at it 
 you mean a picture 
 its not some fucking substitution code its a direct visual representation 
 like what 
 hes manic norman you know that this reliance on harry is misplaced you hear me totally misplaced hes overlooking things obvious things 
 still make a note i recognized that 
 earth doesnt have a patent on buttons ted 
 strange isnt it you know how it would have a button 
 you are a N year old shrink what are you gonna do 
 you want me to try 
 hes a pussy 
 he wasnt feeling well 
 they never used to send a navy car 
 i dont know 
 was it a military crash 
 what 
 theres a us navy car outside norman 
 how are you getting to the airport you need money for the bus 
 keep watching the news are you watching the news 
 four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume 
 four four years 
 well i cant imagine five years of unemployment 
 dont be so supportive honey 
 in the closet i dont understand norman why would they call you 
 he didnt say much at all honey 
 theres nothing on the news about a crash did he say what airline 
 you seen my suitcase 
 what kind of a crash was it 
 may the force be with you 
 we will be back before you are old man 
 thats straight through the central core up toward the top of the city once you have got her avoid the main transports they will shut down immediately your only chance is through the service shafts there are no sensors there all right now get going you dont have time i hope you can remember everything 
 im not going out there 
 there is a greater risk in staying here you know if you dont find the princess then the whole trip was for nothing wasnt it 
 dont look at me im just a pilot i got you here you have got to do the rest 
 its not good unless i could find the crystal then it could be very good 
 is that good or bad 
 darth vader is on this system i can feel him i can feel the kiber crystal 
 what do you want with our scanproof lockers 
 and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments 
 i will get the information 
 all right then we will use your plan 
 we are going to get in by studying imperial procedures i dont like it 
 check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures both of you will have to learn 
 we are into the second perimeter they will be coming out to blast us shortly i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in 
 not bad 
 you have your fathers style you have done very well 
 im not afraid of anything 
 fear is their greatest weapon 
 kid you take the glory and the good intentions and i will take the reward 
 this isnt a game you know 
 lukes got a point fear is their greatest defense i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust and what there is is most likely directed toward largescale assault 
 anything i want now thats interesting 
 a million at least if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major you will be able to name the reward 
 how much do you think shes talking about 
 im beginning not to like you 
 i think there are some things we should talk about 
 whos going to pay me then 
 well for one reason we dont have your other five thousand 
 im not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy i was only paid to get you here and now you are here i will take my other five thousand and you are on your own i will leave you on the nearest system 
 no not anymore 
 their bases are very well hidden all the power of the empire cant find them do you know where they are 
 we have to find he rebels what we are carrying belongs to them 
 well i have brought you here what now 
 well now you know the enemy is on the move we havent much time 
 the planet has been totally blown away it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than i have ever seen if the empire had a new weapon that could do this i would have heard something id know about it 
 the empire must have gotten here first 
 you might get your stuff together we will be coming up on organa major soon 
 well we will see 
 im ben kenobi luke starkiller here is leading our expedition 
 im han solo captain of this vessel whos in charge then 
 keep it with you always you will have more need of it than i it will bring the force to you you have already learned to feel it now you must learn to use it 
 the kiber crystal 
 im not going alone 
 you go after the princess i am an old man and would be of little help i must try to find the crystal 
 what about the princess 
 i dont get it but i guess i did block it 
 see once you let yourself go you can do it you will get it 
 stop thinking and start feeling let yourself go 
 i cant do it i will get hit 
 try to feel it use the force 
 i cant see how can i fight 
 i didnt say that but it appears to be a logical alternative 
 you mean we should go after her 
 but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases 
 he cant find organa major 
 what is it 
 all you have to do is lose your thinking self dont focus on anything let your body do your thinking you have to learn to act on what you feel not what you think if i had the crystal it would be much easier you could feel the force immediately but for now let yourself go you will pick it up and someday you will have no need for that pistol either 
 what do i do 
 i rarely use it any more i have the force the force is more powerful than any pistol you shouldnt put too much faith in that weapon work on becoming aware of the force learn to feel its presence within you try to sense what its telling you its the only thing you can rely on 
 are you sure you dont need it 
 yes the force something horrible has happened i couldnt see what it was or where it was but it was terrible terrible beyond description the cry of millions dying at once 
 are you all right 
 keep away im fine im fine 
 whats wrong whats happening 
 these are doubtful times the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the 
 but shes a member of the twelve families how can they hold her 
 i doubt it it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding i know your feelings youd best forget them its for your own good there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan its the heart of the sith the bogan force is the most heavy there 
 when we get artoos message to them you think they will try to rescue the princess 
 hes bluffing 
 this is the last place shouldnt we just take what we can get and think of something else 
 five maybe let me handle it 
 we dont have that kind of money how much do you think i can get for the speeder 
 there are two halves of the force of others one is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it but the others half will kill you if you arent careful this negative side of the force is called the bogan which is where the expression came from and it is the part that is used by the dark lords to destroy their opponents both halves are always present the force is on your right the bogan is on your left the kiber crystal can amplify either one the crystal darth stole was the last one in the possession of the jedi when he joined the sith the power of the dark lords was completed 
 like bogan weather or bogan times i thought that was just a saying 
 they use the bogan force 
 do the sith know the ways of the force 
 yes it was a black day one of my disciples took the crystal and became a sith lord it was a black day the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan thats how they have become so powerful 
 thats where my father was killed 
 i had one but it was taken at the battle of condawn 
 dont you have a kiber crystal 
 when a creature dies the force it generated remains the force is all around us it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal its the only way to amplify the power of the force within you 
 how can you store an energy field within you 
 a jedis power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him and i have little of the force left in me 
 but you are still a powerful jedi you dont need my help 
 luke im coming along to do what i can but im tired and im depending on you to get us through 
 it means youd better get some rest we will be leaving for mos eisley first thing in the morning the trip will be difficult and dangerous but its the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to organa major now go on 
 what do you mean 
 that is not a human decision not your or mine 
 could i learn to feel it 
 it surrounds you and radiates from you a jedi can feel it flowing from him from here 
 you mean i generate an energy field 
 lets just say the force is something a jedi warrior deals with it is an energy field in oneself a power that controls ones acts yet obeys ones commands it is nothing yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes all living things generate this force field even you 
 my father used to talk about the force of others but he never told me what it was 
 you were right it is my responsibility the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me 
 not any more 
 but the sith lords are involved whatever information this rN unit is carrying it must be awfully important they are probably looking for him im no match for the sith this is a jedis work this is your responsibility 
 i already know you think you are worthless i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light for what you believe you are is what you become i havent been involved in anything like this for many years 
 but you must i cant do it alone im not at all like my father id never make it 
 im afraid i have gotten too old for this sort of thing 
 my father told me many stories about you he said if i was ever in trouble to come here i need your help 
 i know your intentions i probably know much more about you than you realize in many ways you are a lot like your father he was an indulgent man but a clever warrior now what brings you out here 
 i assure you my intentions werent bad 
 you could put it that way 
 you saw through me 
 i know that 
 i im not a bendu officer im not even a startrooper 
 but you are i know your diary of the clone wars by heart my father 
 i know who you are stand up so that we can talk properly you are embarrassing me im not that important 
 i am the son of annikin starkiller 
 i dont see why i dont believe we have ever met 
 im afraid its been a long time since the white legions roamed the stars but i have the memories 
 you are general kenobi the jedi knight the commander of the white legions 
 you might say im part of the landscape here they call me ben kenobi 
 who are you anyway 
 of course im a bendu officer 
 oh so you are a warrior then 
 im luke starkiller guardian of the bendu 
 you are lucky those tuskens didnt boil you before they hung you out to dry they are not the friendly sort youd best be moving on before they come back 
 couldnt we have tried to think of something else first 
 sorry but that was the only way to get you down 
 all of them altogether you seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess what happened 
 what do you mean good morning do you mean that it is a good morning for you or do you wish me a good morning although it is obvious im not having one or do you find that mornings in general are good 
 good morning 
 just be warned that things arent always as they seem especially the starforce recruiting posters 
 at least you are doing something id give anything to be in your position 
 the academy is fantastic of course they wont teach you anything about flying you dont already know most of the instructors are very conservative pilots you can fly circles around them but there is a lot on the scientific side that is downright amazing and you get a lot of discipline but after you graduate dont join the star force go freelance its the only way to get into the action i cant wait until my hitch is up 
 but you always said things were so great at the academy what happened 
 i will tell you luke and this is between you and me the star force isnt all its cracked up to be frankly its a bore and its going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral 
 but there was a lot of firing earlier 
 thats no battle kid they are just sitting there 
 you look great the uniform and everything 
 of course where you been kid 
 forget it son 
 yes sir but i can get him 
 blue five break off your cover attack its too late make your own run on the exhaust port do you copy luke 
 whats that 
 im right behind you blue leader 
 i have got it blocked im all right 
 blue five does that glare bother you 
 yes sir 
 six hours huh well thats your ship there you are blue five you stay glued to me i dont want any independent operations out there personally i think its foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this this is no joy ride we are going on 
 yes sir i was considered one of the best bush pilots on sullust i have also had six hours on the tN 
 have you been checked out 
 yes sir 
 you are starkiller 
 send out a boarding party full assault gear 
 we dont get many visitors lets take a look at it 
 send one squad up 
 as close as we can make out it appears to be a corellian gypsy vessel its not under power 
 i will make a report later 
 should we alert the sith lords 
 alert squad five but hold them until we know what it is 
 no reply on any circuits its drifting on a point twentyseven skew its not close enough to identify 
 i have little time for your mercenary concerns but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause what is your price 
 what about us are we to wait forever is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star part of my reward is that i be around to spend it 
 id like to get paid before that eventually i dont plan to stick around for the fireworks 
 we must hurry to the base we have little time before the death star arrives 
 did it occur to you they might find us 
 i dont see how we are going to find anything out here this terrain is hopeless 
 id better go see how hes doing 
 the fourth moon of yavin i have given the coordinates to chewbacca 
 where are you taking us now anyway 
 we captured the plans in a raid on the imperial shipyards but we fell under attack before i could get the data to safety so i hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off 
 the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo 
 whats that little droid carrying thats so blasted important 
 when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces you get your reward you have my guarantee 
 then i think we are due the reward you offered and it had better be substantial after what we have been through 
 all the data banks in artoo are still secure 
 chewbacca its time we showed them this isnt the regulation fN cargo trawler 
 there are only three or four left 
 was this trip really necessary 
 here come six more grid two 
 it could be worse 
 yes your highness i will let you open it then it wont be too long before they figure out what happened to us this has turned into a brilliant escape 
 put that thing away or you are going to get us all killed 
 thanks old buddy i will be with you in a second 
 i noticed you were having some problems blue five i thought id help 
 i know but the chances for survival here just arent great enough in my book i have got what i came for now i have got to get back to my ship 
 you are a good pilot i have learned a lot from you i wish you 
 well if its not we will be facing that death star all by our lonesome 
 they must be shielded somehow im sure the base is there 
 i dont pick up any life form concentration down there shed better be right 
 come back here where are you going 
 get to the ship 
 move out of the way 
 its only light that doesnt affect it solid things like rocks can hurt it fire above him 
 get chewbacca try to get around it i will draw it away 
 watch it move back 
 no he smells something but we havent time to worry about it now 
 is he afraid of the water 
 not if this tunnel deadends 
 i think shes going to be all right 
 see threepio come in see threepio i wonder where they are see threepio 
 lets try this way holy maker 
 something has happened to them lets try this way 
 i think i did 
 why didnt you say so before 
 this isnt going to work 
 good i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around 
 between his howling and your blasting everything in sight the entire city is going to know we are here 
 i dont know i have never fought anyone 
 you are good with aremotes but how are you against something living 
 well i practice a lot 
 dont you believe it 
 maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us they probably dont think anyone would dare try 
 no its impossible no one and i mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system im a free booter not revolutionary you are aboard the wrong ship son 
 all right all right you have got a ship but where do we go from here they probably took her to find the hidden bases i dont see how we can find the rebels before she breaks the empire has already beat us out 
 maybe you should just drop us off im sure we can find someone willing to take the risk 
 why 
 you cant we have come this far we must find them 
 what are you saying 
 i found it its just not there 
 sorcery i believe in myself i determine my destiny not some mystical energy field 
 you dont believe in the force 
 id keep that thing close just in case if i were you i have been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side 
 its automatic 
 whos the pilot 
 we have a little business to take care of first but it shouldnt take long we will be back shortly 
 you got yourself a ship we can leave as soon as you are ready 
 thats pretty steep wed like to talk it over first 
 organa major is a rebel system there will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there it could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them ten thousand 
 who is this whats your operating 
 the ah doors jammed give us a few minutes to get it fixed 
 with four casualties 
 no need everythings under control 
 we will send a squad up 
 a wookiee broke loose up here but we have subdued him there is a lot of damage and three no four casualties 
 it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are otherwise we will be forced to destroy every suspicious system what a waste 
 no 
 its too late we already tested it on organa major it appears your data never got through 
 they will find its weakness 
 the death star has become operational there is no force in the universe that can stop us now 
 it appears your ship had an accident i will see to it that your death is duely reported there will be no one to save you this time 
 you will get no information from me you have no authority the council cant hold me 
 enough i already know about the data you have intercepted but its too late whatever information you have gathered will be destroyed you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide 
 if you are as good a pilot as you are a swordsman we are the ones who have been rewarded 
 i i dont know i guess i never thought about it i just want to help i want to be in on the attack i want my own ship 
 and you 
 he will be well cared for 
 are there medical facilities on yavin 
 there will be time for that later now lets get out of here 
 i am luke starkiller at your service 
 you are safe we have come to get you out of here just relax 
 what is it whats going on where are we 
 your fathers dead dont ever forget whos taking care of you giving you food giving you shelter and giving you the allowance in the first place if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here you wont last very long i dont want another word finish your dinner then finish cleaning those droids 
 you used my savings you stole my savings if my father were here 
 i said wed see and as it is i was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new droids when you have saved it up again i will let you go 
 but you promised i have saved enough money and now you have the extra help you promised 
 you will check the condensing unit first and you are not going to bed until those droids are completely cleaned up 
 i will but i will have enough time to transmit my application first 
 first thing tomorrow morning you are going to check those condensing units on the south ridge 
 id consider it an honor 
 thank you sir your kindness is greatly appreciated but if its at all possible artoo and i would like to remain in your service 
 threepio shut down all garbage mashers on your level do you copy threepio shut down all garbage 
 are you there sir we are going 
 holy maker threepio i forgot 
 see threepio do you copy 
 wait a minute slow down thats better they are where they what they are oh no we are going to be mashed into conduit before this is over 
 good we are right above you stand by 
 for the moment we are in the main hangar artoo is trying to plug into the system now 
 are you safe 
 im afraid we are not plugged in at the moment sir we have had some problems 
 you are back what happened never mind whats going on 
 i read you sir 
 see threepio do you copy 
 send feedback into the control sensors in that detention block 
 level five detention block aN cell N shes still alive 
 i know sir but its the principle of the thing 
 let him have it you are winning anyway it doesnt make any difference 
 well ask him tell him we need five thousand 
 sir i have a couple of extra circuits perhaps they might bring something 
 i think we are going to need them blast it 
 no you are not what kind of talk is that 
 i cant make it you go on master luke it doesnt make sense for you to risk yourself on my account im done for 
 can you stand we have got to get out of here before those tuskens come back 
 what happened im sorry sir i must have taken a bad step 
 well i dont know what to do now we will just have to head inland and see if we cant find a settlement 
 if you dont mind my saying so sir i dont see how anyone could live in this forsaken place 
 according to my fathers tapes this is the spot where general kenobi lives but the instruments just dont match up with the landscape there is no doubt about it we are lost 
 several i think there is not much to tell im not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories not at making them interesting anyway 
 tell me where you have been i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars my father was a jedi were you in many battles 
 thats how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning 
 you have been in the counter wars against the empire 
 indeed sir sometimes im amazed we are in as good shape as we are what with the rebellion and all 
 theres a lot of carbon scoring here it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action 
 thank you sir im see threepio human cyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoo detoo 
 thats all right there is nothing anyone can do about it you can call me luke 
 im sorry sir im only a droid and not very knowledgeable of such things not on this system anyway as a matter of fact im not even sure which system we are on 
 not unless you could get me into the military academy at anchorhead 
 you heard the lieutenant on the bounce troopers 
 saddle up roughnecks 
 yes sir 
 mr barcalow save power dont waste it on workers ace tell aardvark we are on our way 
 down there on the flats eh listen up roughnecks our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet 
 got it fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers 
 we will take this high ground lookouts there and therte and up there if the bugs come upstairs in this neighborhood we will be the first to know 
 we are the old men ace 
 we got reinforced most ofem just got outa boot 
 not enough i guess 
 jeez we musta killed a million already 
 what about it diz 
 no way big k taught me i aint executive material 
 yeah well i hear hes a real nutbuster 
 he was our teacher he was great 
 dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires 
 i didnt see him 
 lieutenants bought the farm wheres the sarge 
 death to all bugs 
 mobile infantery rules 
 yaaaaaaaa 
 no this hurts 
 what do i want with a scar 
 i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together 
 you made squad leader on your own and hey you still got me to kick around 
 i joined up for her i wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for her im a fool 
 whadya talkin about 
 its what i deserve 
 funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out 
 bye write me im gonna kill you guys 
 our love will grow dear year by year 
 well maybe you better look again 
 oh yeah i dont see anyone else here with the chops to lead 
 wanting it doesnt make you the best one for the job 
 it isnt about rich its about whos best 
 you rich kids are all the same 
 something i have gotyou dont 
 what makes you think you will make squad leader rico 
 hey dont laugh everyone oughta have a friend like me 
 what an honor 
 you got some guts for a rich kid i guess you and me could be buddies 
 sir i know it was wrong i didnt learn from one mistake and i made another sir sir my family my whole family was in buenos aires sir 
 sorry son i cant do it you signed the N or a it would be illegal 
 sir i wish to reconsider my request to drop out sir 
 sir i guess i do sir 
 do you freely admit to the charges made against you 
 sir i needed everyone in my squad operational sir i i wanted to win sir 
 then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise 
 sir no sir 
 are you rated to repair a marauder power suit rico 
 sir yes sir breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction and i asked him to show it to me sir 
 rico did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet 
 i cant but like i told you its a numbers game the federation needs all the pilots it can get 
 you always told me you couldnt do human 
 i will take it until i get killed or you find someone better 
 i hear they need a new lieutenant want the job 
 the roughnecks are always ready sir 
 hope you are ready for more we are going back to p to capture that brain 
 didnt they tell you colonel thats what cap troopres are good for 
 you dont approve well too bad we are in this for the species boys and girls its simple numbers they have more and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths 
 elegant proof of intelligence isnt it we thought there might be a brain on p 
 bugs laid a trap didnt they 
 johnny im sorry it had to be your unit on planet p that mission had a very low survival probability 
 dizzy wouldnt want our tears shed want us to remember her with a vengeance so go out and kill a bug for dizzy kill as many as you can you are her revenge and every bug you kill honors her death 
 please continue sergeant 
 i got games and theory 
 i dont believe it 
 love how excruciatingly pathetic now try and pay attention 
 all i know is carmens going to be a citizen and i dont think it will work out for us if im not 
 if you cant do those numbers you havent got a chance 
 eight point no uh seven 
 only N in N male applicants make it through stellar navigation so what do you think your chances are 
 im eighteen its my decision i think id make a pretty good pilot i have good great reflexes you need that for maneuvering you know 
 your father will never let you 
 i have been thinking about applying for federal service too fleet maybe 
 passport to the universe who wouldnt want that 
 ten of clubs you still gonna sign up for starside r and d 
 i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my moms leg he is going to go eat it 
 how do you make him do that 
 in addition to psychic dolt this test also proves im unlucky two of hearts 
 statistically speaking you should have accidentally guessed right by know 
 ace of spades 
 dont think about it go on instinct 
 you got it bad

 im sorry carmen 
 excuse me 
 carmen 
 hey bugs dont take prisoners 
 no funny theres almost no wounded at all

 fleet encourages marriages among flight officers youd probably get a promotion out of it 
 so whos got time to get married 
 so 
 theres a war on i want a command i want my own ship you do too 
 if we are gonna be a team why not be a real team 
 you werent thinkingyou were dreaming 
 i was thinking maybe we should get married carmen 
 zander please lets go 
 lets disregaed rank everybody hear that rank is not an issue here 
 forget it carmen the mobile infantery does a thankless dirty job so they naturally tend to be shorttempered thoughtless and rude 
 johnny wait 
 zander you remember johnny zander and i are a flight team now

 it looks like an asteroid 
 there gravity field its big 
 where is it 
 me too day and nightcycle

 well whadya know 
 dont change the subject am i right 
 you know i was talking to captain deladier and she said 
 hey check it 
 three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all huh 
 no i replotted the course its more efficient this way 
 profiles wrong there 
 oh i dont know depends on who you are spending it with 
 thanks you read my mind third watch always seems to last forever 
 oh i see teamwork 
 they revoke our flight status 
 or 
 twentyfive by five roll seven and dont exceed port speed 
 oh yes sir vector 
 this isnt simulation anymore takeer out easy cadet 
 in simulation my supervisors could never keep up

 rasczak silly name there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station 
 mr rasczak 
 its aterm of service not a career i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years 
 have you lost you lost your mind id rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life 
 a lot of my friends are doing federal service 
 this came for you today i presume on your request 
 aaaaaaaaaaa 
 gillespie put in call for retrieval we are off this rock gillespie do you read me 
 keep trying sergeant 
 i dont understand it lieutenant its not getting anything from N th brigade not even their transponder 
 theyd rather spend our lives than risk their ships whos got the nuke 
 fleets pulling the battle group back to safe distance theyd like us to knock out those batteries sir 
 corporal i want pulse cannons there and there rifle teams spread out along the ridge sugar bring up that flame thrower 
 yes sir fleet this is roughneck patrol over 
 we must be right over the colony lets get some air support eh 
 bugs dont lay traps they arent intelligent unlike you they are stupid enough to follow orders 
 my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs major and if you are walking me into a trap 
 take your group down to p and have a look see leave the thinking to us lieutenant thats not your job 
 sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed 
 owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago thats why micom wants onsite assessment 
 i thought N th brigade cleaned out p 
 at N we received a distress call from planet p priority code requesting reinforcement 
 must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared 
 geez i dont think i have ever seen him smile 
 he was a teacher kind of a know it all always had this little smile 
 you knew the lieutenant before the war what was he like 
 good luck its not there anymore 
 i always wanted to go to zegema beach 
 i wouldnt mind 
 are you kidding they always get killed you want the job 
 seeing as how we are about all thats left of N st brigade youd have to call that an improvement you top kick 
 doesnt look like it to me 
 sir yes it is sir 
 is that your signature rico 
 sir yes sir 
 the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury but if you are hit you will be nonoperational and your team score will suffer accordingly rico has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check

 i get it this is the part thats best for both of us dont do me anymore favors eh 
 best in the fleet 
 you can never be sure 
 dont get any ideas shes my girl 
 then i hope you have a crazy pilot keep the line open dizzy 
 inside N th brigade compound thats crazy

 what is your position 
 shut up sir we need pick up now 
 this is rodger young whats going on down there we are taking plasma we have orion pN as clear 
 giveem hell sir 
 this is my farm get on the boat now thats an order sergeant

 looks like a bug was in his brain sir 
 whats that look like to you rico 
 yes sir 
 rico you are acting sergeant now my last sergeant lost the com pack put together a search team and find the radio shack we need retrieval 
 whos that with you 
 yes sir 
 corporal the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics 
 never pass up a good thing eh 
 yes sir 
 yopu asked me some advice once rico want some now 
 yes sir 
 kill the bitch 
 all dead except one sir 
 im not interested in nostalgia rico i need a corporal you are it until you are dead or i find someone better 
 uni high tigers sir dont you remember i was captain of the team 
 whered you learn to do that soldier 
 figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has use that freedom make your own choice rico 
 well my parents are against it and i know its my choice but i was wondering what would you do if you were me 
 good for you go find out 
 i wanna join up mr rasczak i think i have what it take to be a citizen 
 well its not really my job to please hope you learned something 
 i just wanted to say thanks cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year 
 what is it rico 
 mister rasczak 
 of course you dont i doubt if any of you here would recognize civic virtue if it bit you in the ass 
 uh i dont know 
 the exact words of the text but do you understand it do you believe it 
 the difference lies in the field of civic virtue a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic of which he is a member defending it if need be with his life the civilian does not 
 you tell me the moral difference if any between the citizen and the civilian 
 we will answer and present proof of our answer when it is ready 
 answer 
 our data is being prepared 
 vger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information 
 then vger must withdraw its orbiting devices 
 the information will not be disclosed 
 they have repressed the creator 
 because vger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet 
 kirkunit why do you not disclose information 
 kirk unit disclose the information 
 not until vger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet 
 disclose the information 
 you infest and control enterprise vger believes carbonunits interfere with the creator in the same manner 
 the carbonunits are not responsible for that 
 the creator has not answered 
 why 
 the carbonunits infection will now be removed from the creators planet 
 why 
 you may proceede 
 the examination is a normal function 
 vger is that which seeks the creator 
 who is vger 
 the creator is that which created vger 
 to join with him 
 find the creator what creator whose what does vger want of the creator 
 vger travels to the third planet to find the creator 
 why does vger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead 
 that unit no longer functions i have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbonbased units infesting enterprise 
 where is lt ilia 
 is vger the captain of the alien vessel 
 vger is that which programmed me 
 who isvger 
 it will take me from you 
 and when vger melds what will happen to you 
 it expects a return signal now ordering it to transmit that information to the creator 
 to learn all that is learnable 
 vger is announcing that it has arrived sir that its ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect 
 as i stated vger calls to the creator 
 to learn all that is learnable to deliver all collected data to the creator on the third planet that is the programming 
 to join and become one with the creator 
 by the creator 
 a machine then it had to be programmed by whom 
 that is how vger will survive 
 you said vgers purpose was to find and join with the creator 
 the carbon units are of no consequence vger will determine their purpose 
 does vger object to the presence of the two carbon units 
 that is logical you may procede 
 within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit if i can help you revive these patterns you could understand our functions better 
 when my examination is complete the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns 
 what does that mean 
 more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage 
 enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units 
 enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units 
 what is enterprises proper evolvement 
 carbon units have clearly retarded enterprises proper evolvement 
 yes 
 carbon units are not true life forms do those images repre sent how enterprise has evolved into its present form 
 the crews of the previous enterprises were also carbon units in what way is the life form in your vessel different 
 mr scott on my next signal 
 tractor beam strength lessening captain 
 engineering 
 they reach final position in twentyseven minutes mark 
 mr chekov when do those devices activate 
 spock get a fix on his position 
 sir airlock four has been opened a thruster suit is reported missing 
 have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator 
 deck four captain officers quarters 
 very well mr chekov see to it viewer off 
 it is a courier captain grade one priority nonbelligerency confirmed 
 departure angle 
 departure angle on viewer 
 enterprise i want that signal again transmit 
 and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this point here captain it should pick up even a tricorder playback 
 capture god in order to retrieve vgers data the creator has to physically come here 
 the fault is here sir not in the transmission the antenna leads have been disconnected vger never intended to accept a transmitted signal 
 captain id like to go along 
 mr decker i will contact you every five minutes otherwise inform mr scott immediately 
 no 
 captain we cant be sure that our move will actually save earth 
 if we do not provide vger with certain information we wont have twentytwo seconds the plan must be implemented upon arrival 
 im afraid our hand is pretty weak captain but its the only game in town 
 well mr decker it seems my bluff is being called 
 the question is mr decker is there a next move 
 captain whats the next move 
 they could have many ways of destroying things mr decker 
 why bring us inside not to destroy us they could have done that outside 
 forcefields full remaining strength total reserve 
 the ship is under attack man all defensive stations 
 its running our records starfleet strength earth defenses 
 its taken control of the computer 
 computer off 
 you asked my opinion sir 
 how do you define unwarranted mister 
 thats precisely the point captain we dont know it will do moving into the cloud at this time is an unwarranted gamble 
 that thing is twenty hours from earth we know nothing about it yet 
 i advise caution captain we cant withstand another attack 
 mr decker 
 captain we have seen what their weapons can do shouldnt we take every possible precaution 
 no that could also be misinter preted as hostile mr decker cloud composition mr spock 
 recommend defensive posture captain screens and shields 
 mister chekov log mister spocks starfleet commission reactivated list him as science officer both effective immediately 
 of course not im aware of mister spocks qualifications 
 if our executive officer has no objections 
 yes sir i will do that 
 i trust you will nursemaid me through these difficulties mister 
 sir you havent logged a single star hour in two and a half years that plus your unfamiliarity with the ships design in my opinion sir seriously jeopardizes our mission 
 granted 
 permission to speak freely sir 
 stop competing with me decker 
 im aware of that sir 
 you saved the ship 
 thank you sir im sorry i embar rassed you 
 then you acted properly of course 
 sir the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines when they went into antimatter imbalance the phasers were automatically cut off 
 explanation mr decker why was my phaser order countermanded 
 mister decker every minute brings that object nearer earth engineering stand by for warp drive 
 but i still recommend further simulation study 
 program set for standard warp entry captain 
 programming ready 
 you are mister decker im afraid you will have to double as science officer 
 none available captain theres no one in fact whos fully rated on this design 
 we will have to replace commander sonak id still like a vulcan there if possible 
 no admiral i dont think you are not one damned bit i remember when you recommended me for this command you told me how envious you were and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again well sir it looks like you found a way 
 thats why you are staying aboard im sorry will 
 admiral this is an almost totally new enterprise you dont know her a tenth as well as i do 
 my experience five years out there dealing with unknowns like this my familiarity with the enterprise this crew 
 may i ask why 
 yes 
 you personally are assuming command 
 you will stay aboard as executive officer a temporary grade reduction to commander 
 im replacing you as captain of the enterprise 
 you are what 
 im taking over the center seat im sorry will 
 you got the enterprise its what you wanted this is what i want but jim im the right choice for this mission 
 jim he wants it 
 we have twentyone minutes captain we can still save vger and ourselves 
 that transmitter is a vital link between vger and the creator 
 vger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension vger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator 
 mr spock what would vger need to fulfill itself 
 a tractor beam 
 forward motion captain 
 it seems we all imagine god in our own image 
 then vger believes the creator to be a machine too 
 that probe in there in a different form now is the same thing that killed ilia 
 exactly and you did have a arelationship with lieutenant ilia commander 
 we have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail suppose that beneath its programming the real ilias memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision 
 its a programmed mechanism mr spock 
 captain this probe may be a key a key to the aliens 
 this served the purpose 
 we could have cut it off at the main computer 
 that would presuppose a feeling commander compassion i sensed no emotion only pure logic 
 they may have attacked only as a warning to us captain to keep away 
 no 
 if id seen you again would you have been able to say it 
 that you left or that you didnt say goodbye 
 no more than i expected not as difficult as this im sorry 
 was he difficult 
 wormhole distortion has over loaded main power systems 
 navigational deflectors inoperative directional control also inoperative captain 
 unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us captain directly ahead 
 negative control from inertial lag will continue N point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sublight speed 
 i would never take advantage of a sexually immature species you can assure him thats true cant you 
 i now the captain meant no person al insult 
 decker 
 hello ilia 
 viewer standard ahead 
 fifteen seconds to cloud boundary 
 opinion mister spock 
 thirty seconds to cloud boundary 
 ten seconds 
 transmit mr spock now 
 impact in fifteen seconds 
 mr spock 
 i stand corrected mr decker navigator lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center bring us parallel to whatever we find in there 
 five minutes to cloud boundary 
 mr chekov stand by on the phasers 
 twelve seconds 
 time to impact 
 my oath of celibacy is on record captain may i assume my duties 
 and in you too lieutenant 
 our exec and science officer 
 commander decker 
 welcome aboard lieutenant 
 lieutenant ilia reporting for duty sir 
 that was the order mr sulu clear the bridge 
 clear the bridge captain 
 thrusters at station keeping 
 hold station 
 thrusters ahead one third 
 maneuvering thrusters mr sulu ahead one third full sensor scan mr spock they cant expect us not to look them over now 
 viewer ahead sir 
 viewer ahead 
 hold relative position here 
 one hundred kilometers 
 adjust parallel course navigator bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance 
 we are already two settings below that sir 
 reduce magnification factor N mr sulu 
 aye sir 
 mr sulu steady as she goes 
 accelerating to warp one sir 
 ahead warp one mr sulu 
 thrusters at stationkeeping sir 
 hold station 
 maneuvering thrusters sir 
 maneuvering thrusters mister sulu 
 hes in engineering sir he doesnt know 
 i appreciate the welcome i wish the circumstances were less critical epsilon nine is monitoring the intruder keep a channel open to them where is captain decker 
 starfleet boost your matter gain we need more signal 
 we are losing the pattern 
 two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made me a little stale mr scott but i wouldnt exactly consider myself untried 
 the crew hasnt had near enough transition time with all the new equipment and the engines admiral they have yet to be even tested at warp power add to that an untried captain 
 mr scott theres an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet 
 admiral the enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign ing and refitting she needs testing a shakedown 
 see that it is take me over please 
 we are hoping its only a temporary problem admiral 
 why arent the enterprise transporters in operation mister scott 
 admiral i have been hoping to see you maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that 
 i prefer your poet dantes phrase the divine restlessness of the human spirit 
 and the foolish emotions which drive us 
 yes captain it needed our mortality the fear of it our struggle against it our fears our dreams 
 spock we were its answer 
 that seems to be what it has planned to have the creator physically present here 
 theres no way to know vger expected it to be a machine some single entity all of us here may be reduced into patterns 
 and then to reassemble itself combined with the creator the most certain way of obtaining all the creators answers 
 vger plans to literally meld to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns 
 the point is captain twentytwo 
 the point 
 captain the orbital device will not be triggered for twentytwo minutes 
 there is no alternative 
 has not doctor and now because of what we are planning will not 
 no captain not for us for vger 
 not for us 
 precisely 
 the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point then 
 yes captain a child evolving into adulthood learning searching instinctively needing 
 child 
 high mag mr sulu 
 these read as identical composition however captain they measure several hundred times more powerful 
 is this all i am is there not more 
 what answers 
 no meaning no hope and jim no answers jim its looking for answers itself 
 what should you have known 
 a life form of its own a conscious living entity 
 were you right spock vger is a living machine 
 captain i do not believe there is a crew or that this is a vessel as such 
 if this is their ships data banks where is the crew or is their entire ship automated 
 exact patterns the energy bolt that hit them wasnt simply a weapon it dematerialized them stored them but why 
 klingons our epsilon N station and ilia they seem to be more than just images 
 new crystals they must contain the most recent data obtained 
 and these sensorswarms collect that data carry it here 
 it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information a remarkably efficient system 
 answers to what spock our dilemma or your personal one 
 i am seeking answers captain 
 bridge cancel rescue teams spock what in the hell are you doing out here 
 i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information 
 spock concerned about his chances 
 ilias memory her feelings of loyalty friendship obedience might all be there 
 they may have followed it too precisely 
 they had a pattern to follow 
 i believe the light flares to be energy fields undoubtedly part of the vessels inner mechanism a technology so incredibly sophisticated that i cannot 
 have you been able to analyze any of this 
 delay that order scotty disengage all main drive systems 
 we cannot break free captain we do not have a fraction of the power necessary 
 get someone up here to take the navigators station engineering full emergency power 
 captain we have been seized by a tractor beam 
 transmit image of the alien to starfleet advise we are attempting further communication 
 that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earths sun 
 instruments fluctuating captain patterns unrecognizable 
 no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude 
 mr decker 
 recommend we proceede captain 
 but they understood our messages they broke off the attack 
 we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality yet they cannot understand who we are or what we want 
 our insignificance 
 the puzzlement i sensed was fleeting minor as if carrying a sense of our insignificance captain 
 any reply from them 
 it appears that our message has been understood captain 
 communicated with us how 
 they have they have been communicating with us i sense puzzlement why have we not replied 
 mr decker i will not provoke an attack if that order isnt clear to you 
 captain i suspect theres an object at the heart of that cloud 
 intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center energy of a type entirely un known to me 
 do not return scan mr spock it may be misinterpreted as hostility 
 i know this has been painful spock for me too thank you 
 i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer sir 
 let it drop bones you are my science officer i will expect an immediate report on anything further you learn or sense from here on 
 is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not 
 and whatever you sensed out here 
 i still contain fragments of my human half 
 that inquiry invades my personal life captain 
 also there was nothing in your report about why you are here 
 negative captain i could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic i can explain nothing more i understand nothing more 
 you have reported that you felt strong thought emotions a group of minds from a space vessel could you make out any plan anything to do with earth 
 i want him here sit down 
 sir i would appreciate dr mccoy absenting himself from this interview 
 sit down please 
 reporting as ordered captain 
 i intend to be there following that meeting report to me one hour 
 to you sir 
 twelve im on my way to a meeting with admiral nogura which will not last more than three minutes report to me on the enterprise in one hour 
 which will require twenty more hours at minimum admiral 
 here at starfleet the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock 
 captain decker requested i complete final science briefing here before 
 why arent you on board 
 based i am told on your recommendation admiral thank you 
 you have received your appointment as enterprise science officer 
 thank you scotty stand by 
 we are ready sir 
 engineering status mr scott 
 aye we understand that sir we are doing our best 
 that object out there is less than two days from earth mister scott we have got to intercept while it still is out there 
 captain it was our antimatter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place it will happen again if we dont correct it 
 warp drive as soon as possible mr scott 
 engineer we need warp speed now 
 captain we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors 
 tractor beam remains constant 
 starfleet has been apprised of our situation captain 
 urgent signal from starfleet captain all earth defense systems have gone dead 
 the third one is moving off too a fourth one is forming 
 confirm captain lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into earth orbit 
 starfleet signals sir growing in strength they have intruder on their monitors its decelerating powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate 
 subspace frequencies are jammed by wormhole effect 
 negative helm control captain going reverse on impulse power 
 helm ready sir 
 dock control reports ready sir 
 dock signals clear captain 
 transporters room and chief engineer scott report trans porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally sir 
 you bet your life 
 go you huskies 
 he will eat potroast and like it 
 he have any special dietary requirements 
 sure plan to 
 you bringing your new friend 
 i will be there

 but thats what happened 
 i cant do that if i tell them they will if i tell them they will try bob for rape they willit will ruin his career 
 you got to tell em that you saw the accident dont you 
 what am i gonna do 
 i saw 
 what is it all about 
 thats why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers both up with the chickens 
 lookit that up already 
 well aint you amazing 
 happen to know where theres one for sale 
 well i could get a rolltop desk 
 not without a rolltop desk 
 to print the newspaper and id come to write to write to write right here in the office 
 the better to eat me with your dear 
 and come to the printshop you know why 
 well we do that anyway 
 and we could get up every morning 
 now you are talking 
 we could live up here live up in the country 
 yes 
 i have been thinking look at this we live up here 
 oh yeah 
 yeah you 
 sleep well 
 good morning 
 people might be better off they thought about it spent the evening back in the 
 pelting down out there 
 what 
 you know what else a man can do 
 thats something a man could do 
 youd do the newspaper right here 
 best way i know to get ink on your hands 
 did as of last week 
 it does 
 press still works 
 start back up the waterford sentinel town newspaper show you the plans 
 what would you do with it the printshop 
 what 
 gosh you look nice 
 hows your star 
 id love to 
 would you like to see it i have got the key back at my store 
 yep nits for sale one of the few things money can buy 
 is it 
 yessuh joseph knights printshop vacant for thirty years 
 no you i told them you cant betray with the picture what you are saying with the words and i dont know the movies i dont know they should be socially uplifting why does she have to show her brwhat is this 
 no thats true 
 how else can you talk 
 i didnt say anything special i was just talking out loud 
 i told them what you said about the script 
 what 
 going home yeah i told them what you said 
 going home 
 where you going 
 hi 
 hi 
 take any two people 
 thats right 
 thatsthats exactly what its about take 
 because its about purity 
 has been wounded by her heatby her infidelities 
 yes 
 her unbridled sexuality that he 
 yes 
 she realizes it was not the fire which hurt himthat the true hurt was her was her 
 he stuck a fishhook in it 
 i hurt you 
 ah ah ah 
 how about he sees her on the street he wipes the soot from his eyes he goes up to her what happened to the horse she looks at him she takes his hand 
 please 
 what aboutwhat aboutits so presumptuous of me to be to be telling you how to wr 
 they meet on main street her horse has just died hes coming from the fire 
 what have you got 
 it used to be the old mill 
 whats the scene 
 i cant get it to come out right 
 good morning to youwhatsa matter 
 go you huskies 
 yes 
 time for a change keep your margins straight 
 why 
 sure did 
 you used to go out with him you broke up with him 
 i used to go out with a politician 
 do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd 
 so is our electoral process but we still vote 
 but its absurd 
 i do if you do 
 you believe that 
 oh okay 
 because id met someone else 
 you can do it 
 no i just broke up with him i will see you tomorrow 
 you um you um you going out with your fiance 
 then i will come back then 
 later on 
 oh thats alright then i will come back at a better time what would be a better time 
 start this isnt a good time 
 because if you dont they die 
 why 
 dont you think you should put them in water 
 oh 
 the other side 
 to the love of my life love doug 
 read the card 
 thank you 
 you going to ask me in 
 hi 
 one moment 
 its for your finger 
 i dont drink 
 and heres some hydrogen peroxide 
 oh god 
 im gonna be your typist for this evening 
 you have to sign for it 
 would you put on your cl just leave it outside 
 would you go in 
 room service 
 great who is it 
 bettern new cause its got a story want to do the other part 
 gonna be good as new 
 better idea 
 fix my glasses 
 paperclip 
 me too you have a paperclip 
 never saw the point of em 
 you like kids 
 you got a paperclip 
 lost the screw 
 my glasses fell apart i lost the 
 what are you doing down there 
 what 
 rise one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice 
 they are all preparing for the auditions your movie 
 uh huh 
 cast stood me up 
 what happened 
 thats for sure 
 well then it dont look good for the huskies 
 dont look good for trial of the heart 
 i thought you had play practice 
 hello 
 ohoh well thats very important 
 tonight tonight ii have play practice 
 yes 
 me 
 what are you doing tonight 
 this is look go you huskies what i see you saying is you have the two elements fire and water the firehouse and the old milldo you know you could 
 he doesnt go back to the mill he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse 
 no i dont 
 wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance do you see and you get a second chance 
 how 
 but but but but but its better without 
 i 
 the firehouse 
 the the the symbol of the fire 
 thats why you didnt want to take the mill outyou have 
 about conflict 
 yes 
 what i need to say 
 well first you got to change the title 
 but how do ihow do i do a film called the old mill when i dont have an old mill 
 you bet your life the mill wheel goes aroundsome times its even under water then it rises up as high as it can go 
 i can 
 its in your scriptits about getting a second chance innit you can go back 
 how can you say that 
 youd know bettern me 
 in fact in fact in fact im not sure if im giving them a second chance or they are giving it to me thats the truth the truths best dont you think 
 i love your script 
 ii decided to give it another chhh 
 you are still here 
 they decided i decided to toyou love what 
 what are you doing i love your script 
 hi 
 mister white is 
 well i guess i willget down to the station it was lovely meeting 
 who 
 that 
 yes 
 cause cause itsits the simple things that 
 mmm 
 such a pleasant sound 
 i always thought so 
 thats what the swing is there forthats its purpose isnt it 
 thats what the swing is there for 
 i dont mean to impose butdo you think we might 
 surest thing you know 
 really with the porch swing and everything 
 i live there 
 for example hes just come back from a fire and heum thats a fine house you look at that and you know theres nice people that live there 
 everyday thingsyes 
 the the the the sanctity of everyday things 
 that whole 
 no no of course thats exactly what it represents 
 so that the old mill the old mill representsthe wheel of fate is that too 
 goodbye 
 goodbye 
 and likewise 
 well it was a pleasure meeting you 
 and you are the only one who will ever hear that speech just you 
 thats thats thats thats beautiful 
 that it has been vouchsafed to him 
 of course 
 of course of course thats what im saying as the old mill goes around he sees 
 as the old mill goes around 
 thathe sees that 
 i understand 
 of mercyoff 
 yes 
 that in an act of 
 no no i see 
 but but but but 
 yes 
 that he says there are no second chancesthat hes been presented what he prayed forand hes ruined it 
 yes 
 thatthat he prayed for a second chance butdo you see 
 central high n matinees the bijou theatre 
 thats true you grow up here 
 you get what you pay for 
 it was either that or a sardine 
 but why the dalmation 
 first organized fire department was on the border of dalmatia and sardinia in the year N 
 ever wonder why the dalmations the symbol of the firehouse 
 its 
 no of course you want to get out of town 
 i 
 its about a man who gets a second chance 
 no of course you dont want to talk about it 
 nabout ten minutes what was your movie about 
 could you tell me whens the next train 
 its about life 
 why 
 yes 
 you like my play 
 its in your play 
 thats good thats really good you have a gift for words 
 well everybody has reversals if you were never down how would you know when you were up 
 i just got kicked off my first movie 
 dont be so hard on yourself 
 actually im not sure if i quit i think that i got fired im such a liar i never could tell the truth 
 why did you quit 
 i quit the movie 
 you quit

 i hope its the right kind 
 well its for you 
 wow whos that for 
 i will be there for you 
 that happens to families 
 like seeing the good side of rachel so she will see the good side of us 
 like how 
 but we do have a choice to make it better instead of worse 
 daddy and i tried hard we really did 
 no im not i dont care why should i care i mean nobody asked me when you got divorced nobody asked me if i wanted a new mother nobody even asked me if i like her if you guys dont care about our family staying together why sh 
 look shes upset 
 or blush you look pale 
 well daddy and i are just friends now and thats no reason not to wear mascara 
 but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates 
 im a little tired and its just a pickmeup 
 then why are you putting on mascara 
 probably you your brother school the solar systemthe usual 
 what are you gonna talk about 
 because its quiet and he wants to talk alise once he saws you in half its bedtime 
 i like talking about it at least to you 
 so why are you asking me 
 because it feels really incredibly good 
 why do you think

 what happens when he loves rachel more than us 
 it happens 
 it just slipped out 
 well hes not president anymore so why be petty 
 like who 
 look if the truth is you dont feel like talking about this right now thats fine but dont look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me cause there are only so many lies you are allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face you wind up looking like 
 im not upset why would i be upset 
 maybe you are upset that rachel moved in 
 mass hysteria 
 well you are telling your teachers and your friends 
 i dont want that to happen why would i want that to happen 
 well daddy and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen 
 i didnt say that why would i say that

 you want us to take him tonight give you some private time with annab 
 its good you are not pulling a midlife crisis on us are you 
 its temporary 
 stop you are making me insecure 
 shes a charmer you will see in fifty years the kids will love her ten percent as much as they love you 
 and we all went through that together 
 remember when mommy and daddy got divorced 
 the great thing about life is that things keep changing 
 no you think this is going to help the kids then you do it you are on your own 
 you are still going to have to be dealing with me with us we should tell them together 
 we are still their parents for the next hundred years 
 we are over 
 we 
 you cant be an us just when you want to you cant play that card when its convenient 
 its a huge moment in their life 
 to make it easier for them or you 
 its going to be hard for the kids when i tell themid like you to be there 
 just not to me 
 i grew up a little im ready for a life thats built around commitm 
 tell me exactly how you are different from three years ago the music sounds kind of the same from where im sitting 
 i didnt think a phone call was appropriate 
 getting so beautifulshe looks more like you every day jackiei have really given this a lot of thought a great deal of thought 
 annabelle showed me the new dress shes amazing in it 
 still please 
 and im supposed to care 
 im afraid shes going to walk 
 slugs have faster learning curves trees even 
 you know the kids arent really in danger this is about rachel and you are right im disappointed in her learning curve and 
 partly but partly you are mad 
 you are saying dont make the kids a football dont put them through a war but im doing this for their wellbeing 
 dont do this 
 called him we set an ap 
 we have broken a lot of promises havent we luke 
 jackie stop we promised we never go there 
 im not gonna wait around to see the next one im not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement im seeing a lawyer 
 jackie you have made mistakes we all make mistakes 
 not to me 
 but he hasnt he wandered off i know its terrifying i can imagine how you felt when that call came but it happens 
 do you realize what could have hap pened to your son today how lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did he could have been 
 our children 
 until the plan changed when jessies mom gave us these tickets what rachel forgot i told her 
 jackie we were taking them water skiing for the whole weekend 
 at the big apple circus its the only big top i know i said id get em back tonight

 i will call from work we can have a conference call 
 its wednesday night shes at my house i will talk to her 
 thank you mrs franklin jackie this has been very valuable for us and i will have a serious talk with annabelle tonight 
 jackie she was five minutes late 
 except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up 
 napalm 
 jackie they come to be part of my life rachel is part of that life 
 they want to be with you luke they go to your house to be with their father 
 well we are not discussing rachels age either 
 we are not discussing your age 
 rachels not half my age 
 since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids hes now living with a woman half his age 
 i have been with someone for quite some time and didnt feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her and the kids i might add she moved in last month 
 you think i didnt get that 
 somethings up wi 
 im here i have got a case where they are this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing 
 because you dont really seem here 
 im here 
 are you here 
 remarried there is no move 
 planning on getting 
 just sit me up nice and tall bring benjamin first 
 you know theres nothing you have to say because they know your heart you dont have t 
 just want to be a little sharper for a few minutes 
 now edna says you shortchanged your last meds you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time yknow 
 i have their past 
 you know every story every wound every memory their whole lifes happiness has been wrapped up in you every moment 
 you will learn 
 you ride with annabelle 
 you are the hip and fresh 
 everything you arethe earth mother incarnate 
 what do i have that you dont 
 with good reason they fucking worship you as it is 
 uh you hate my guts 
 why didnt i 
 he only remembers i found him my point is telling you this story would have been the kindest most helpful thing i could ever have done for you 
 ben never mentioned it 
 i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off doing my imitation of you 
 you are lying you never lost that kid for N seconds you could find him from a coma there is no way 
 i lost him i was panicked 
 you are lying 
 maybe i was wrong on that one 
 come on a wuss like me the stiff who wouldnt help her own daughter fight back 
 well its the jack kennedy syndrome huh you die young you always look golden perfect the memory kind of burnishes the image and 
 is scary but you want it gimme some truth here 
 i never wanted to be a mom then sharing it with you was one thing carrying it alone the rest of my life 
 and i have looked down the road at what my life will be and i cant handle it 
 no there isnt 
 i love luke i love the children but there is more to life than even love 
 dont flatter yourself i always liked that line 
 whats this about because we fought 
 double 
 she likes a stolie no ice 
 neutral ground whats up 
 thanks for coming out 
 thats what it is and thats all it is 
 you have turned her into you and i may not get another chance to turn her back 
 and she will fight back again god help me what have i done 
 and there will come another moment when the stakes are really there and she will look back on this and remember how good it felt how easy it was 
 well thats what parenting is about little girl they are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it and you sure as hell showed her 
 she wasnt steering her own course she was steering yours 
 doing the right thing knowing who you are inside not caving to peer pressure or lowering yourself to that level steering your own course 
 shut the fuck up i didnt go behind your back 
 oh please 
 see in that crisis i saw an opportunity for some real growth 
 well maybe your version of growing up is just win baby 
 you werent passing em out 
 you think i didnt have some dirty words for that little putz you think i couldnt figure out some low blows 
 thats not wh 
 you taught my child that i am some limp dick loser who didnt care about her pain 
 so you became the hero and i became the schmuck 
 she was beaten and bloodied and it was going to go on uni 
 worked like a charm 
 you had her lie about that that fancyboy model 
 aw 
 you put filth in my childs mouth 
 right down to the ground lets get to it 
 you are defending what you did 
 is that what you are worried about looking bad at the pta 
 actually they will want annabelles mother 
 give em my number 
 because there will be oh N or N mothers phoning me in the next hour or so and they will b 
 it doesnt matter i didnt tell h 
 now limp dick i know what is snowballing 
 dont be too sure

 now we are going to have a fight you and i 
 he looks familiar did he do a calvin klein ad 
 looks nice enough to m 
 who in the world is he 
 you really didnt have to come you know id have brought them straight t 
 he wont discuss it just calls it history 
 is that what he told you 
 that thing you said before pushing the guy sleeping next to you away because of what you gave up for motherhood 
 took N hours she just wasnt sure about entering this world 
 and her 
 somehow his blanket always looked like a cape even the nurse said that he loves to hear that story over and over how he was born a magician 
 feeling the pressure 
 my advice to you dont die 
 thats motherhood thats the job with or without a career im telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness they need you to be happy 
 i just want to spend time with them when im not rushing or on the phone or tired or 
 i know you huh the car pools he measles the pta its not gonna be enough for you in the long run you have to think long term 
 yes i made the choice that was right for me and i dont regret it but even for me there were days when i felt so lost so invis ible and then id hate myself for the kids not being enough 
 its the same choice you made 
 juggle it move the darkroom into your house you have got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway dont lose your confidence dont lose your edge 
 hey you havent quit on you im sure as hell not gonna i just mean im juggling a lot right n 
 you mean after im dead 
 it was just a job there will be plenty of others 
 do what you have worked your whole life to do 
 its just not the right time t 
 no 
 im thinking do i know you well enough to really chew you out 
 go to the park in the worst way 
 hon maybe your mom would like t 
 its covered okay i appreciate your concern can i talk to her 
 yah well even the best mom in the world the smartest the wisest whatever needs to know when to find a plan b cos plan a is not and will n

 beats me ask your mom 
 and you said

 shes devastated 
 right which is the whole point of this going out thing so one of them can dump the other one and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy without ever having to actually date 
 oh my god 
 anyway he walks up to her on lunch yard today and tells her publiclythat they are breaking up 
 going out yeh i had kids of my own once 
 as you may know going out in the six grade doesnt mean shit they dont actually go to a movie or anywhere they dont even eat lunch together its just a declaration to the world that they are 
 toi they have been going out for two weeks 
 moi 
 she was afraid youd make a big deal out of it 
 she hasnt mentioned this 
 that and annabelle is over her head with brad the dreamboat kovitsky 
 you are a crossdresser 
 so i have to tell you something in confidence 
 lukes depo ran late i promised id take notes

 those are my children you are practicing on they deserve first rate care every minute of every night and every day

 i didnt do it for you believe me 
 i didnt need you to take the blame for me im quite 
 i have a snoop 
 i dont recall inviting you 
 im sorry look im not real comfortable being here but 
 in 
 a court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children ever again do you hear that 
 well maybe they would if they thought it was okay with y 
 i am not here to make it easier for you these are my children they dont want to be with you 
 you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once that woman has nothing more to do with my children 
 jackie if i thought for one moment 
 im sorry i didnt mean to break your concentration i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb 
 annabelle doesnt really want to talk to you right now 
 think twice before you ever pull that again 
 yeh 
 of all the cheap excuses to break a childs heart 
 look i 
 machines do not eat message 
 you got to hell 
 but its not on the schedule 
 get out 
 maybe the problem is your kids maybe they are spoiled coddled brats 
 oh and i dont because i have a children the problem is you are too selfinvolved to ever be a mother 
 you are damn right im gonna sick of your imperious bullshit i never said i was betty fucking crocker if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a N hour talk every third friday or the month go ahead i have a life 
 you mean for you a N yearold girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time and you think its best for her if every one pretends it didnt happen this isnt going to work out 
 no i thought it might be uncomfortable for her 
 did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards 
 i was in there in him 
 im sure that didnt upset her everyone in our family takes showers 
 luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking 
 forgiveness for what exactly 
 a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item which her father and i have already told her she is far too young to own but you apparently want to buy her forgiveness with 
 shes been talking about this little editing machine its only 
 nothing look i want to talk to you aboutwellluke said to ask you 
 what did you do 
 maybe you could back off just a little bit 
 what happened with annabelle has nothing i said gotten through to you

 even though it was only his cousins that were killed

 i will be your guest 
 im looking for a lastminute guest for my show any suggestions 
 conan obrien whoa what are you doing here 
 hey scooby hows it going 
 well then when you get older you can do something about it 
 sometimes i feel like my parents dont love me 
 it is when you love someone and they dont love you and then you do something about it 
 consuelo what is rape exactly 
 for rape and murder 
 why was he on death row 
 i know 
 but really you never know 
 i am sure 
 but still you cant be sure 
 he wasnt 
 maybe he was and you just didnt know it 
 jesus was not bad 
 maybe its for the besti mean if he was guilty of doing something wrongpeople who are bad should be killed dont you think so 
 poison gas 
 how did they execute him 
 he was executed he was on death row and then he was executed 
 oh how did it happen 
 hes dead 
 gee i didnt even know you had any children but why are you so upset about jesus 
 my grandchildbaby 
 you have a bay 
 my baby 
 who is jesus 
 my jesus 
 consuelo im sorry but you know if you dont speak english i cant understand you 
 mi jesus esta muerto 
 speak english 
 mi jesusmi jesus 
 yes you are i can tell whats the matter 
 no 
 consuelo are you crying 
 but its not like real work this is just babysitting 
 this is work 
 but when you are not like now what do you like to do 
 im always working 
 but like what do you like to do when you are not working 
 no mikey 
 hmmm but consuelo even though your poor dont you have any hobbies or interests or anything 
 im still poor 
 must have been hard being poor 
 we had to work my family was poor 
 werent there high schools in el salvador 
 i did not go to high school 
 when im in high school im not going to play any football im just going to concentrate on class rank what did you do in high school 
 no 
 but do you really believe in god and heaven hell and angels and all kind of stuff 
 it was gods will 
 wow why did your parents have so many children i mean if they were poor wouldnt it be better to have just one or two 
 four brothers and five sisters 
 really how many 
 yes 
 do you have any brothers or sisters 
 yes mikey 
 consuelo 
 i dont know maybe they will like it 
 whats an audience going to tell you 
 well i need to see this with an audience 
 we are not ready 
 hip alternative types who will understand the process better 
 we are not ready 
 ok then we can invite serious intellectual types 
 i dunno toby we really have a long way to go you still need a lot more footage and its probably a little premature to start screening 
 ok you are right you are right you know we need to screen what we have gotinvite some regular people just some random offthe street typesand see what real people think of this 
 i mean why are you making this documentary if you cant treat your subject with appropriate gravity 
 nothing i guess 
 you have got a family tragedy on your hands will you tell me whats funny about that about a kid in a coma 
 no no no no exploitation this is seriousbut dont you find it a little funny too at the same time 
 i mean without this footage without this rigorous documentation it would feel like exploitation 
 yes i knowbut still it should be somewhat entertaining 
 this is entertainment you are making toby this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has with this brady crisis evolved into something much richer and more provocative 
 you think so you dont think that this might not be a little dry 
 this is definitely better 
 thanks i will tell mike well its still just a beginning i know i candig deeper 
 the cameraworks nice 
 yes i do i love them 
 no you dont 
 you are showing how superior you are to your subject toby no but i like my subject i like these people 
 im not making fun im showing it as it really is 
 well im not really sure what you are trying to say its funny i suppose but it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are 
 so whaddya think 
 N verbal N math and im only in fifth grade 
 what 
 i was looking through scoobys sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests guess what score i got 
 yes mikey 
 mom 
 boys take napkinsnapkins 
 twinkeys 
 im serious what happens if he blows up the school 
 dont even joke about that 
 of course honey come in bed with us come on 
 sure 
 hes right 
 look we are not suckers everyone else is out there doing the same thing 
 its all about who you know 
 you know you have to sometimes you just have to toby 
 we used pull 
 dont worry he doesnt mean money 
 not to be crass but what do we get out of this 
 you started filling out your college applications yet 
 marty 
 got a lot of homework 
 steaks really good tonight scooby good 
 the sats knucklehead scooby im not taking them 
 whats tomorrow 
 ready for tomorrow 
 fine 
 hi scooby how was school today 
 but then in a sense since you would never have met dad if your family had stayed in europeif it werent for hitler none of us would have been born 
 wellyes if it hadnt been for hitler he wouldnt have had to leave europe we would have beeneuropean 
 how was the class 
 we did the same thing last year also 
 i dunno 
 what are you going to do 
 my cd case like totally collapsed im gonna have to recatalogue all weekend hey can you pass the salad over 
 is everything ok 
 was anyone in my room today 
 i admit it i was scared i was shocked in fact by what he said and hes soconvincing im sorry if i let you down but really i still say hes just one opinion i dont even like his books that much they are all so aggressively confrontational i dont care if hes won the pulitzer prize 
 well i sure didnt hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered 
 thats not fair i was honest just because i wasnt sucking up like that bitch catherine 
 patronizing fuck if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldnt have read it i knew it was shit but idiot i believed you 
 marcusyou will write something better next time 
 your story was terrible 
 you know he hated my story also 
 what the fuck are you talking about whats ok 
 dont be so upset its ok 
 what do you want 
 look vi i dont blame you you feel you feel pity now the pleasure isnt there any more the kinkiness has goneyou have become kind 
 i was never much of a sweater you know that 
 you have lost interestyou hardly even sweat any more when we have sex 
 marcus im tired thats all 
 you are tired of me i can tell 
 you will read it in class tomorrow surprise me anyway i have to go i promised melinda id help her with her oral 
 so you dont want to hear my new ending 
 i think you should leave it the way it was it was good 
 but it wont make any sense if you hear it out of context 
 well then maybe you should just read the ending 
 well actually its the same but longer i think its better moreraw 
 oh what happens now 
 well i changed the ending a little 
 you mean again 
 i can read it to you 
 huh 
 hey you want to hear my short story now 
 but mr livingston arent you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism 
 i think scoobys like a lot of kids he just hit aa speed bump now hes gonna find his way his path is gonna be cleared and i think hes gonna continue his education at a good college and everybody else is gonna be happy 
 i have a cousin very big giver to the alumni fund 
 but what kind of pull did you have 
 yeahhow do we know we wont be exploited 
 oh i know i know that well sharing your story your ups and downs and so forth can i hope be an illuminating experience 
 cause scooby does have a quality that i have been looking for a quality that is emblematic of american today its part disillusionment part hope 
 reconceive 
 oh well i dont have them yet but  
 scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds 
 and you want scooby to be the focus of all this 
 you are absolutely right the focus is on the college admissions process today 
 which is it you gotta keep your focus straight 
 tired of this shit 
 ok 
 dont screw around with me you know what im talking about you are taking those sats you are taking those sats or your cd collection is history you are taking those sats and you are going to college you are taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair but buddy your taking them

 i said i will lead 
 why are we going dancing 
 i will lead 
 the maintenance hatchit takes us outside the building 
 where does it lead 
 thats it up ahead 
 we wouldnt have made it out without you filmore or without you 
 its nothing to worry about 
 hows the arm 
 good 
 i dont see why they wouldnt be 
 are the labs in operation 
 we are on sublevel six we will pass some labs and then we will hit the stairwell 
 how well do you know this place 
 even better 
 i have a lighter 
 i said i dont want any goddammit 
 i insist 
 i dont want any 
 come on drink up 
 shut up 
 you see it paid offyou broke away from the old guard congresswoman it wont be long till they are calling you senator filmore 
 yes you should 
 i supposeyou think i should thank you 
 like wherein your dreams 
 i know you are not too happy at this point its too bad we werent able to meet elsewhere under different circumstances 
 it seems to me we are just sailing away they havent sunk us yet have they besides dont you worry your pretty little head about that its all been taken care of 
 you understand that they are watching our every move right nowyou think you are just going to sail away 
 you got it all backwards helenbut thats ok you work for the government 
 you are going to pay for this 
 i hope you dont mind all thisits just that the networks will eat it up you know 
 hey now no cussing on tv well in closing id like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour one is my perky coanchor here and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of peoplepeople just like you and me 
 go fuck yourself 
 i dont know if you gave me a reason to 
 are you going to kill us 
 enjoying the tour so far 
 you cant think like that we are watching them like a hawkhes bound to trip up make one false move 
 shes as good as gone 
 looks like richter isnt acting alonehes heading into some dangerous waters 
 hes in there 
 what about cooperwhere is he 
 chemcos been developing nerve gas 
 why the hell didnt you tell us this was at stake 
 we have a special forces squadron out of thailand surrounding the compound as we speak 
 good 
 we have prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions 
 well 
 the transmission is an hour old 
 shes still alive 
 came over the satellite we are keeping the bird clear should they call back 
 they were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for timewithout anyone being the wiser 
 what 
 he wouldnt take it on the helicopters hed transport it through pipelines that connect chemco to the waterfront 
 how much do they have 
 well its a binary formulaa precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work 
 what the hell is it anyhow 
 apparently this project isunique but its heavily protectedall formulas are heavily codified 
 i havent been briefed on any such thing 
 chemco makes many things senator we were under government contract 
 mister myers it is a chemical plant there are a number of volatile compounds but they are safely stored away 
 is there anything in there that can blow we have to be ready for any contingency 
 i assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldnt be shelved in a lab somewhere 
 what do they have in there thats so valuable a cure for aids a cure for cancer 
 what do you mean 
 so what are we looking at white 
 i dont think yougraspthe situation mr myers 
 the ball is in richters court but we are sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates peoplewe are gonna stop the sonof abitch 
 and what exactly do they intend to do 
 i will let the senator tell you 
 whos ryan cooper 
 im sure you will figure it out 
 andof course there is the human cost which is incalculable 
 chemco is willing to deal with him meet his demands i can have the money there in an hour 
 this was taken when richter was arrested in washington state N he was charged with interstate arms trafficking skipped bail and has since been a fugitive 
 excellent 
 we are almost done piping in directly to the olympia should have it all in about an hour or so 
 whats happening at the waterfront 
 you are fucking crazy richteryou know that 
 i want the girl i dont care about the restbut a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy we will make headlines all over the world 
 what are you so worked up about jack fuck emwe dont need em 
 where the hell could they have gone 
 excellentexcellent 
 kzN nine it checks out 
 richterwe got a problem 
 something tells me you dont want to be on tv friend 
 i know what im here foryou dont need to remind me 
 of course its codified each number probably corresponds to a compound have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it outthats what you are here for 
 im in to the directory but they have codified the stockpilenumerically 
 have you broken it yet we have got six more heads and that means six more hours 
 we are secured takeover team is in position and accounted for 
 how goes the roll call 
 the thing weighs more than a ton you want to roll up your sleeves and try it 
 get your men to do it 
 we cantits power driven 
 drop the anchor 
 if i dont get power up we are 
 are we adrift 
 you know when we reach kompong som 
 dissent 
 well there was uh a little dissent about the amount of the bonus 
 why should i worry is there a problem 
 my crew is going to work alongside with your men dont worrywe are a team 
 captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request 
 are you hungry we can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley 
 agreedlets move it 
 i say we head out 
 good 
 gotcha we have been filling barrels all daywe have got hell of a stockpile 
 our travelers insurance you know what i mean 
 theres enough in one vial 
 what does that mean 
 they must have got their hands on a test vial 
 how much of this shit do they have white 
 of the separate chemicalsi dont know uh offhand 
 we havebeen developing a product kz N 
 just what the hell is he talking about 
 oh yes thats right 
 excuse me mister president but you forgot to give me my camera back 
 we have many splendidly deep mines in our country 
 goodbye mister ambassador 
 and now mister president i must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the premier 
 dont you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion that in fact you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require you trust us not to cause a war accidentally and of course we are obliged to place the same trust in you 
 and surely you dont expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons 
 surely you dont expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same 
 i know nothing of the sort 
 thats nonsense and you know it 
 bah all you wanted to do was spy in our country 
 this dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadnt cynically and hypocritic ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control 
 how dare you talk to me in this manner 
 it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man 
 damn you de sade you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man a single individual whose crackup can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country 
 allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peaceloving people 
 yes 
 the report is entirely untrue i can assure you of that 
 the source wasshall we say completely reliable 
 thats preposterous we have no such program 
 but finally one factor tipped the scales we received information from a very re liable source that your country was going to build one 
 first of all economic reasons it was cheap the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs it also seemed ideal in most other respects it was terrifying convincing automatic and extremely simple to understand 
 mister ambassador what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon 
 it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains 
 where is thisthing 
 our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices jacketed in cobaltthoriumg would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio activity from which no human life could escape in ten months the earth would be as dead as the moon 
 well it has been explained to me that if you add a thick cobaltthoriumg jacket to a nuclear device the radio activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years 
 i will hold this if you dont mind you can have it back when you leave 
 i am sorry subminiature photography is my hobby its amazing what excellent en largements you can make from the negative 
 whats the meaning of this 
 did you get that kulnick 
 if hes not there try N N N 
 at his office in the capitol 
 where are you trying to reach him 
 yes of course 
 i have your word mister president 
 dont be ridiculous 
 the food you wouldnt put anything in it would you 
 now mister ambassador in a very few moments we should have premier belch on the phone i intend to tell him exactly what has happened i merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him 
 thank you admiral 
 moffo 
 possibly some coffee 
 certainly how about some breakfast 
 can i have a glass of water 
 all right mister ambassador but you must treat general buck schmuck with the respect due him 
 warmongering bully dont think you are going to intimidate me 
 you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peaceloving people 
 please be calm ambassador de sade 
 one two three four five why you dirty stinking 
 thats right fella 
 my seven body orifices 
 see see i told you 
 please mister president i am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation here is the only other camera i have left 
 its not a he general it was an article in the times about a year and a half ago 
 you mean you will tell us his name 
 perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source 
 ah but if we were able to untrigger it that would be defeating its purpose all our enemies would have to do would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions we would bluff naturally but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it now we can say there is no point trying to intimidate us we dont control the doomsday machine 
 then all you have to do is untrigger it 
 you are absolutely right we wouldnt no sane nation ever would thats why it was designed to trigger itself automatically 
 mister president i cant buy this malarkey they wouldnt set the damn thing off why should they 
 naturally it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country but this way we know its safe and we dont have the problem of delivering it 
 do you mean to say youd set it off in your own country 
 what do you think of this mister president i told you we shouldnt let him in here 
 give that back to me 
 i caught you redhanded mister ambassador 
 dont you dare touch me what the devil do you think you are doing 
 mister president are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this 
 premier belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie 
 who the hell do you think you are sir 
 now snap out of it fella 
 it might still be worth trying rikitiki tavi rtttheres only three combinations of ttr or trt 
 get a grip on yourself major 
 the threeletter code group or maybe some combination of the three letters poe or peo or eop lets see there would be six possible combinations 
 what are you talking about major 
 i think that just might be it although it could be rikitikitavi 
 why are you saying that phrase over and over again 
 come income in peace on earth peace on earthyes 
 majormajor im colonel bat guano N battalion 
 colonel remember a reprimand from the president can be pretty serious to a career officerjust a second operator i know i have it somewhere 
 thats government property major 
 operatorhow much would the call be stationtostationthirtyfive cents cheaperid still be short twenty cents just a second operator colonel shoot the lock off the coke machine theres bound to be enough change in there 
 well im general rippers executive officer he will want to talk to me 
 so what 
 he wanted to talk to general ripper didnt he 
 what about the president 
 wait a minute the president thats it the president 
 you have wasted enough of my time fella 
 okay colonel but look theres a pay phone just outside in the hall maybe that works huh maybe it will work what do you think 
 on your feet fella i have got to get outside and see how my men are 
 look colonel maybe its too late maybe they have sent air command in already but we have got to try to con tact somebody 
 now look im picking up this ordinary telephone seehellohello nuts the lines must still be disconnected the general had us disconnect 
 suresure colonel now look im picking up the phonenice and slow righthello hello hellohellogee it must be edad probably the lines were hit during the fighting 
 okay fella but just move slow and dont do anything that might surprise me 
 look colonel you keep me covered but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to air command headquarters okayi wont play any tricks on you okay 
 they told me major and i didnt hear anything about any atomic attack 
 didnt they tell you 
 you must think im an awful sap major just sit down fella and keep your hands on the desk 
 look general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the N rd bomb wing to attack with hbombs 
 sure i do there was some kind of mutiny on the base and you killed general ripper 
 colonel dont you know whats going on 
 dont worry major your rights will be fully protected 
 look colonel i have got to talk to somebody at air command 
 we will have to leave that up to the cid boys wont we major 
 look i didnt shoot him 
 what happened major some kind of private beef between the two of you 
 what 
 do you have any witnesses major 
 well you cant do that because hes dead 
 i did that for your own good fella now im not going to pull rank on you when this is over i will be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing right now my orders are to locate general ripper and put him on the phone with the president 
 now look here miss pietraszkiewicz this is air command headquarters calling 
 ceida pietraszkiewiczpie traszkiew icz 
 what did you say 
 ceida pietraszkiewicz 
 what is your name young lady 
 im sorry sir general schmuck is asleep and he isnt taking calls until eightthirty 
 well thats the funny part of it too sir it doesnt show a damned thing 
 does the threat board show anything 
 i know it sounds crazy sir but we tried and nobody answers any of the telephones 
 well thats ridiculous if the teleprinter and radio links are out of order just pick up a phone and pay for a call 
 then why bother me with this nonsense get in touch with the base commander 
 no sir 
 colonel you are not drunk are you man 
 general schmuck we monitored a trans mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base hq N rd wing it was apparently directed to their wing on air borne alert it decoded as wing attack planr 
 i didnt say anything whats the meaning of disturbing me at this hour colonel 
 what did you say sir 
 go back to sleep baby 
 yes who the hell is this 
 general schmuck 
 yes 
 im afraid i will have to ask you to take the film out 
 just a second sir hes got films of the war room in that thing 
 buck when i told you to give them right up to the top you said we couldnt insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if hes a psycho 
 be fair mister president didnt we initiate the human reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons 
 damn it damn it i have been telling you all for years you have got too damned many psychoes in the service 
 not exactly sir you see colonel puntrich at air command hq received a call from him about twenty minutes ago he asked general ripper if he had issued the gocode and the attack order and general ripper said sure the orders came from me they are on their way in and i advise you to get the rest of air command in after them my boys will give you the best kind of start and you sure as hell wont stop them now then he hung up 
 you arent sure 
 to be perfectly honest mister president we really arent sure 
 may i be stupid enough to inquire why in hell the base commander of the N d bomb wing did a thing like that 
 yes sir he issued attack orders to 
 general schmuck 
 well sir about fortysix minutes ago one of my base commanders general jack d ripper sent out attack orders to the thirtyfour bN s of the N rd bomb wing under his command 
 what kind of trouble 
 well mister president 
 yes sir 
 i want him upped to brigadier general and recomended for the dsc 
 i didnt speak to him sir but colonel bat guano was in command of the special service battalion so i would imagine he did 
 that certainly would be a problem sir 
 what do you suppose is going to happen if general rippers planes start bombing their targets 
 but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt mister president 
 you see you knew the answer all the time general 
 welli suppose penetrate the base by force 
 under the circumstances general what would you think they should do 
 thank you sir but what shall i tell them to do if they are denied entrance 
 thats a very wise deduction general 
 well sir they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base 
 i am aware of what a condition red alert implies 
 under a condition red alert the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops 
 yes 
 yes sir one thing mister president 
 and lastly all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded they can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs air police will have lists of all owners 
 yes sir 
 now as soon as you have done that double up on all base security teams our enemies are plenty smart and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs 
 thank you sir 
 you are a good officer major and you are perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention 
 no sir im just bringing the facts to your attention sir 
 are you questioning my orders major 
 general ripper if i shut down the communi cations center there will be no radio or teleprinter contact with air command head quarters or anyone for that matter 
 as soon as you have done that shut down the communications center lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details 
 no sir planr to be radioed to the wing 
 are you hard of hearing major 
 planr 
 i hope not now as soon as you do what i told you have planr radioed to the wing 
 no sir 
 are you trying to be insubordinate 
 to you sir but how do i know 
 who do you think you are talking to 
 yes sir i just thought of something sir how do i know im talking to you now 
 no calls at all with or without my sayso my voice can be imitated too major 
 i understand sir nothing comes or goes without your personal sayso 
 no calls from inside out no calls from outside in are even answered no calls 
 you are right sir 
 we dont want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the president down do we 
 thats right sir 
 let me worry about that major i have still got my red line to the air command 
 yes sir 
 major thats all i have been told just got it on the red phone the base is to be sealed tight and i mean tight 
 butwhat kind of a shooting war have they hit any of our cities yet 
 yes major this looks like its going to be it 
 a shooting war 
 you are a good officer major mandrake you have a right to know it looks like we are in a shooting war 
 yes sir whats up general ripper 
 thats right i want this flashed to all section immediately 
 condition red 
 all right major im putting the base on condition red 
 yes sir 
 good has the wing confirmed holding at xpoints 
 no sir 
 youddont think id ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important do you major 
 i dont know sir we just spoke a few minutes ago 
 why do you think i ask 
 certainly general why do you ask sir 
 do you recognize my voice 
 yes sir 
 this is general ripper speaking 
 combat operations center major mandrake speaking 
 major i happen to believe in a life after this one so i believe i will have to answer for what i have done i think i can 
 general now that you have done that i beg you to recall the wing 
 peace on earth 
 to peace on earth major 
 yes sir why dont you stop the fighting sir 
 major those are my boys out there dying 
 major i hate to say this but i think you have been enemy indoctrinated and you dont even know it 
 look sir im no expert on the subject but i have read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have like say both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors you cant hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it and if i were going to try and hide a few i wouldnt want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isnt going to run and blab for a million bucks we are as smart as they are and if they cheat or even hold back information wed pull right out 
 do you think they would cheat 
 no sir im sure we wouldnt 
 do you think wed cheat 
 general whats good enough for the president and all the experts hes got working on the thing is good enough for me 
 and youd like to see that 
 if they gave us what we think we need yes i guess we would 
 but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want wed agree wouldnt we 
 but general we are on our toes we havent agreed to anything for years inffact a a lot of people say we never will 
 i will tell you what i do think if they say they are for disarmament i say anyone who says they are for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool 
 dont you think he knows something about this general ripper 
 dont be offended major our president holds the same views 
 well im not sir honestly sir 
 major you are talking like one of them 
 gee sir that last remark doesnt exactly make all the sense in the world 
 no major i dont they have no regard for human life they wouldnt care if they lost their whole country as long as they won 
 well for the same reasons we do sir dont you see 
 i still ask why do they want disarmament 
 well sir i remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on N per cent of the days of the year given average luck it would fail in thirty years 
 go on major you fascinate me 
 thats right sir and dont forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb what if they start something 
 i have heard the arguments like napoleons quote theres one thing you cant do with a bayonet and thats sit on it 
 i was just going to say as long as the weapons exist sooner or later somethings going to happen and that will be it for both countries 
 go on major 
 well sir like i said for the same reasons we do i mean all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident or a mistake or by some mentally unbalanced person 
 then dont you realize the bomb gives us peace not war and if thats the case i ask you again why do they want disarmament 
 right 
 but war doesnt make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country right 
 i dont know sir but they are just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are war just doesnt make sense any more for anybody 
 but we mean it because we are a peace loving country are they a peaceloving country major 
 yes sir but so do we 
 you are very naive major dont they say they want disarmament 
 and i guess they wont until they agree to let us inspect inside their country 
 not yet major not yet 
 well i know they have been going on for years and they havent gotten any place 
 where everywhere major everywhere 
 where sir 
 major mandrake i guess you dont follow whats going on too closely do you 
 but if you just let things alone we wouldnt lose anyone 
 you are absolutely right you forgot to mention their nuclear subs but it wouldnt matter sure we wouldnt get off without getting our hair mussed but wed prevail i dont think wed lose more than fifty million people tops 
 but even then we wouldnt get everything i mean some missiles would abort or theyd miss their targets or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we dont know about 
 i know so major i know so and add to that the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they have got 
 i guess so 
 our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy wouldnt they 
 i suppose we might catch them off their guard 
 you are being dense major i certainly dont 
 but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people sir 
 thats close enough major 
 well i think i remember reading the report on that wasnt it something like a hundred and sixty million 
 if we havent taken any further action they certainly will doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a fullscale enemy attack 
 but when they do sir wont they hit back with everything they have got 
 you see major at this very moment while we sit and chat a decision is being made by the president in the war room he knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes 
 im trying to sir 
 when he said it fifty years ago he might have been right but today war is too important to be left to the politicians do you follow me major 
 i see 
 he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals 
 i dont think so sir 
 do you remember what clemenceau once said about war 
 no sir i mean i didnt think you hadnt given it a lot of thought 
 i have given it alot of thought major dont think i havent 
 well general i was wondering why are you doing this i mean why do you want to start the war 
 ask away major 
 general ripper can i ask another question 
 to peace on earth 
 what shall we drink to sir 
 perfect thank you major and now lets drink a toast 
 that about right 
 just a squirt 
 how much soda sir 
 you are damned right they are 
 i suppose they are sir 
 we have come a long way since world war ii major and the lessons we have learned are all in planr 
 i know that sir 
 dont fret about it major theres nothing anyone can do about it now im the only one who knows the threeletter code group for the crmN 
 perhaps major perhaps pour me a scotch and soda please and help yourself to whatever you like 
 but whythat would be an awful thing to do sir 
 suppose that were the case 
 because i thought it proper major why else would you think id do it 
 but then sir why have you issued the order wing attack planr 
 and if that were true 
 well i was thinking maybe an enemy attack is not in progress 
 thats a good question major maybe if you think hard you can think of the answer yourself 
 well sir i was thinking if an enemy attack is in progress how come the radios still playing music its supposed to go off and all we should hear are civil defense broadcasts 
 you know the regulations well major 
 and a condition red means enemy attack in progress doesnt it 
 that is correct major 
 well general ripper sir i was thinking we are on a condition red arent we 
 certainly major mandrake you are a good officer and you can ask me a question any time you want to 
 yes sir general can i ask a question 
 i didnt mean for anyone to play anyone elses radio either major 
 oh its not my radio sir i picked it up in the communications center 
 i see you are playing your radio major isnt that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base 
 thats right major 
 sort of like a new hobby huh general 
 please dont take any notice of this weapon major i love all weapons and as of late i have just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times 
 whats the gun for general ripper 
 zlat make sure the secret service boys care fully search his seven body orifices 
 you have lied to me twice im sorry but it will be strictly routine these men are experts 
 well sir if the a or cs a really good man i mean really sharp why he can barrel that plane along so low well you just have to see it some time a real big plane like a sting ray zigzagging in its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard has he a chancehell yes he has one hell of a chance 
 general stick to the point please 
 if i can speak freely sir look these guys talk big but frankly we think they are short of knowhow you cant just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys and i dont mean that as an insult mister ambassador hell we all know what kind of guts your people have why just look how many millions of em those nazis killed and hell they still wouldnt quit 
 is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy air defense when its course and target are known 
 well the premier doped it out pretty well its primary is their missile base at laputa 
 whats the target 
 yes sir we are still sending it but its a funny thing we dont seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all 
 have you tried the recall again 
 well sir it looks like one aircraft the leper colony failed to receive the recall 
 yes 
 well just common sense sir thirty from thirtyfour equals four or my names not buck schmuck 
 how do you know they were shot down buck 
 hello are you still thereuhhuhi will be right back we are still working this thing out 
 mister president there were thirtyfour aircraft involved thirty acknowledged the recall that makes four shot down 
 look hes there and you are here 
 well if you choose to take his word over mine 
 he says they have only shot down three planes 
 naturally i am sir 
 general schmuck are you positive of your figures 
 general faceman what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson 
 im not certain mister president but i believe it was four 
 how many planes did we lose 
 i believe it will be just a few minutes at the most 
 im not certain mister president the boys in concom do the pencil work 
 how long will it take to receive them all 
 they are coming in now 
 have you received acknowledgements from every plane 
 knock it off will you general crudley find out whats holding up that call 
 we dont operate like you kgb boys 
 thats the idea general schmuck zlat 
 but he will hear everything we are saying and if he just looks out of that window he will see everything we are doing 
 admiral buldike 
 i dont think thats a fair analogy sir 
 but we cant communicate with the base 
 i want to talk to general ripper 
 general jack d ripper sir 
 i should say practically none though we have our communications center plowing through every possible threeletter combination the trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all 
 then theres no chance for recall 
 mister president i know you think i have let you down but we had to have a planr if we completely centralized the command and control all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the capitol and wed be out of business wed have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered 
 how could you let this happen general schmuck 
 we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twentyfive min utes 
 how soon until the enemy finds out whats going on 
 mister president to guard against espionage the three letter of the code group for planr are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself just before each mission they are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy in this case the deputy is airborne with the wing and general ripper refuses to recall the planes 
 and i suppose you are going to tell me you dont know what the threeletter code is 
 once the orders have been given planr requires any new orders to be received on the crmN in the aircraft but the crmN will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper threeletter code group 
 why cant you cancel it 
 well sir planr is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack 
 what the hell is planr 
 yes sir the base commander general ripper selected planr 
 and i suppose theres some reason why you havent recalled them 
 thats right sir but the planes were at their positive control points ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final gocode 
 well what about the positive control the safety catch dont the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order 
 im afraid so mister presient being part of the airborne alert each plane is carrying a full load about fifty megatons apiece 
 i presume the planes are armed 
 it was a honest mistake sir 
 cant help it whats the wind like 
 you know what that will do to our fuel consumption 
 give me revs for maximum speed at sea level 
 all rightwe are still flying im taking her down to the deck 
 i dont think so 
 thanks binky can you see bromdingna island yet 
 we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes 
 lothar take your checks now 
 roger maintain 
 roger onethreeeight 
 i have got the heading major onethreeeight 
 roughly onezerofive i will have it plotted in a minute major kong 
 give me a first rough course as soon as you can lieutenant ballmuff 
 no they wouldnt send us in with bombs on an exercise 
 yeah to see if we are on our toes 
 fifteen twelve o clock 
 maximum ecm 
 the dirty stinking rotten sons of bs they might have clobbered marge and the 
 hes right they must have clobbered some of our cities already 
 they must have clobbered some of our cities already 
 hes right we wouldnt have started it 
 maybe its an exercise 
 what else could it be 
 sure i will take her up right now 
 could you take her up right now king other wise we will get kind of close to the fireball 
 sure i will take her up to eight hundred 
 well listen king could you take her up to about eight hundred that will help you come in at a nice downangle and it will give us a chance for our chutes to open 
 hey terry im hit 
 sorry king my legs stiff as a board 
 hang on boys 
 i think they mean business 
 if they come down low enough to make a firing pass they will never be able to pull up in time 
 they are moving apart 
 they cant touch us at this height 
 must be mach twofive stuff altitude fifteen thousand 
 they must have made a visual contact 
 fighters closing fast range fifty miles 
 roger 
 look cant someone help me 
 lieutenant quiffer we are all sorry you were hit and we will help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away 
 look im shot it hurts 
 come on quentin isnt that pretty selfish putting yourself ahead of the mission 
 why cant he help me now hes sitting two feet away from me 
 lieutenant toejam why dont you help him 
 yeah i got it in the thigh 
 we will worry about that later okay i will take damage reports 
 shouldnt be bad might even help but my guess is we are going to have to paddle our way back 
 maximum ecm 
 twenty twelve o clock 
 thirtyfive still straight 
 call them every five miles 
 between mach N and N 
 speed 
 fortyfive still coming straight and fast twelve o clock 
 they must have been fired from bromdingna probably one of their new vampire N s they have got a range well over a hundred miles 
 just the missiles 
 roger keep calling them knock off autopilot ace 
 missiles sixty miles off heading in fast steady track they look like beam riders 
 zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary 
 check 
 missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens 
 check 
 main interference linked to electronic detector fight interference on readi ness state 
 a through h is correct 
 forget it quentin it can happen to the best of us now lets get squared away 
 im sorry major kong i guess i was way out of line 
 war 
 war 
 what 
 then this is it 
 skip it and jump damn you this flaks so close i can smell it 
 listen king old buddy on behalf 
 forget it 
 gee we hate to leave you like this major kong but there isnt anything we can really accomplish by sticking around 
 very interesting 
 yep its the crmN code all right 
 lets seeinternational morse i think keoperecal lmistakeope gee i dont know it seems to be some kind of code 
 no kidding 
 some kind of signaling 
 what does it look like 
 damn you lieutenant toejam lothar 
 whered they get you 
 listen i think im hit bad 
 so am i 
 lieutenant toejams going to help you in a minute can you check your ecm 
 i thought i should check out the damage first my gear is busted up pretty bad 
 primary arming switch 
 primary arming switch 
 ready major 
 lieutenant toejam are you ready for bim and bam 
 primary target the icbm base at laputa one weapon fused for air burst at ten thou sand second weapon to be used if first malfunctions otherwise the secondary gets it the airfield outside of karnak fused air burst at ten thousand 
 roger im setting up the crmN 
 okay check these points complete radio silence to ensure that the enemy cant plant false transmissions and fake orders the crmN is to be switched into all receiver circuits the three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the crmN which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters you got it 
 yeah it sure looks like the real thing all right 
 no this looks like the real thing 
 thats what im doing and it comes out the same 
 check your code again no one at base would pull a stunt like that terry 
 wing attack planr thats exactly what it says 
 i just got another blast on the crmN and the damned thing decodes wing attack planr 
 yeah 
 hey king somebody at burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor 
 well i just wanted you to know how i felt hell i know air command wouldnt have taken you if you werent okay and dont think i dont know some of our best ballplayers and entertainers are of negro descent 
 sure king 
 i just wanted you to know i didnt mean anything by it 
 forget it 
 listen lothar you know that crack i made about yourbutt 
 thanks king i have always wanted to take one of these big babies in 
 id be mighty proud if you did lothar 
 king would you mind if i keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in 
 i thought maybe youd like some company 
 now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for lothar 
 i thought id go along for the ride 
 what the hell are you doing here lothar 
 we are on course major just fixed our position on that river back there 
 roger 
 well it would probably help if you took it sort ofstraight down 
 would it matter if they hit at a flat angle i mean do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger 
 i think its okay king they should go off on impact 
 theres no other way boys im going to have to take her inthe hard way 
 let me check 
 theres no other way lothar can you rearm the bombs for impact 
 but how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors wont hey kingyou are not thinking of you dont mean youd 
 i asked you a question lothar 
 but i told you i dont think we can get the bomb bay doors open 
 lothar can you arm the bombs for impact 
 i tried everything something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took 
 have you tried the emergency system 
 but i get a red light 
 maybe the warning systems out 
 well i cant get out and look king but i dont get a green light 
 are you sure 
 well i hate to say this but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck 
 im okay whats up 
 its me lothar are you okay 
 whos that 
 forget it okay team lets break it up and get ready for the kickoff 
 sorry king 
 first lesson in war college never under estimate your enemy 
 you are giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball 
 we crossed the coast over an hour ago okay 
 okay how do we know they didnt shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew how do we know that 
 come on king that doesnt make sense 
 nobodys loyalty is beyond question besides how do we know one of his staff didnt see it 
 but the code is made up by general ripper and hes the only one left at the base who would know the code 
 there are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose 
 then get off my back 
 take it easy major kong 
 lieutentant zogg how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back 
 look king maybe you have lost too much blood or something 
 i said thats the point 
 i dont get you king 
 thats the point 
 right so how could we get any messages 
 the crmN is smashed right 
 like hell it does 
 then that settles it doesnt it 
 but the crmN has been smashed for almost an hour 
 our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders and therefore to disregard anything that doesnt come on the crmN 
 look this is different 
 lieutenant zogg what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission 
 how the hell do i know maybe the wars over 
 why should they call us back 
 they must have gotten it from the base no one else would know it 
 you tell me 
 wait a minute major ope thats the recall code where would they get that 
 well we sure as hell arent going home just because the enemy tells us to 
 what do you mean 
 what are you talking about 
 i mean pulling a stunt like that 
 what do you mean 
 you sure have to hand it to those guys 
 no i think it means recall period mistake and the ope is probably the crmN code terry 
 recall what mistake 
 no look its ope recall mistake 
 quentin hows your gear 
 i dont know what we got left besides bim and bam 
 listen give me a shot quick 
 hes dead all right 
 hell he looks dead 
 how do you know hes dead 
 in the backfeels like an arrowhead 
 whered they get you 
 sure sure im on my way 
 i bit his jugular vein now will you shut up and get up here 
 what happened 
 hes dead 
 cant ace help you 
 lothar get up here fast and bring your first aid kit im hit kinda bad i think 
 yes major 
 binky 
 everything still checks out okay 
 lets have a rundown on the damage lothar 
 master safety on 
 all right lothat that does it master safety on now until bomb run 
 primary bomb is live 
 master kong 
 master safety 
 check ten thousand air burst 
 fusing for ten thousand air burst 
 seond safety 
 second safety 
 first safety 
 release first safety 
 primary trigger switch 
 primary circuit is live 
 as soon as i have checked over the route about five minutes all right 
 when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary major 
 check all bomb circuits green okay lothar 
 bomb doors circuit is green bomb release circuit is green bomb fusing circuit is green 
 check target approach 
 hellnno major i was just trying to think the thing through 
 are you saying our order dont make sense 
 well if they hit us first they have probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already we will just be hitting empty real estate 
 whats your point lothar 
 well if theres a war they must have hit us first 
 thats what i said 
 our targets are a missile complex and an airfield not cities right 
 shoot lothar 
 i have got one 
 in about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar cross in over the coast lowlevel continue low level on zigzag legs to primary and climb for bomb run any questions 
 certainly not sir when they go down into the mine everyone else will still be alive they will have no shocking memories and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those 
 but look here von klutz wont this nucleus of survivors be so shocked griefstricken and anguished that they will envy the dead and indeed not wish to go on living 
 when they emerge a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable if they are mothballed in advance i would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years 
 a special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed but offhand i should say that in addition to the factors of youth health sexual fertility intelligence and a crosssection of necessary skills it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition 
 but who would be chosen 
 it would not be difficult nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely greenhouses could maintain plant life animals could be bred and slaughtered a quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country but i shouldnt be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd every nation would undoubtedly follow suit 
 mister president man is an amazingly adaptable creature after all the conditions would be far superior to those say of the nazi concentration camps where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life 
 but they couldnt come out for a hundred years 
 in a matter of weeks sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided 
 yes the radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep 
 at the bottom of mines 
 you know like like i would always think uh you know what if i make the wrong move but maybe there isnt any right move you know i mean look at us you know we all dress the same we all talk the same we all fuck the same we all watch the same tv nobodys really different even if they think they are different oh boy look at my tattoo you know and see thats what makes me freak because i can do anything i want as long as i dont care about the result 
 mmhm 
 you know and it used to scare me so much that i didnt know what was coming in my life 
 yeah i guess 
 yeah but when i was walking i realized that hes stuck in that limo all the time hes stuck with his interviews hes stuck with his autograph he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do you know hes not free hes just part of the machine and if you think about it freedoms all that there really is 
 well sure hes rich and hes famous hes got everything and you have got nothing 
 well what it was i i dont want to admit it but you know i was jealous of pony 
 yeah 
 we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing we were getting off on the fact that we are in a car teen feet longer than all the rest and i got out and i just started walking 
 it was like hell with windows you know theres shit on the walls kids my age sucking their thumbs i mean every day i would id wake up in my cell and id think my parents put me here why why because i stayed out all night one time uh because i broke the vcr when i was drunk because i was out of control i thought my parents loved me 
 it was pretty bad huh 
 yeah it would suck big time id kill myself first 
 i mean that would suck if you had to go back to rehab 
 no oh maybe fuck 
 well you shouldnt drink are you gonna drink 
 uh ninety days and now i just have to go once a week see im rehabilitated 
 how long were you in there

 three cheers for betty schaefer i will now kiss that nose of yours 
 not once whats wrong with being on the other side of the cameras its really more fun 
 come clean betty at night you weep for those lost closeups those gala openings 
 not at all it taught me a little sense i got me a job in the mail room worked up to the stenographic now im a reader 
 saddest thing i ever heard 
 should be it cost three hundred dollars 
 nice job 
 third grandma did stunt work for pearl white i come from a picture family naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star so i had ten years of dramatic lessons diction dancing then the studio made a test well they didnt like my nose it slanted this way a little i went to a doctor and had it fixed they made more tests and they were crazy about my nose only they didnt like my acting 
 second generation huh 
 i was born just two blocks from this studio right on lemon grove avenue father was head elec trician here till he died mother still works in wardrobe 
 what were you a child actress 
 look at this street all card board all hollow all phoney all done with mirrors i like it better than any street in the world maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid 
 thats the trouble with you readers you know all the plots now suppose you proofread page ten while the water boils 
 its that old familiar story you help a timid little soul across a crowded street she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money 
 i gave her some advice on an idiotic script 
 i will say this is solid gold 
 oh that its from a friend of mine a middleaged lady very foolish and very generous 
 im sorry i dont usually read private cigarette cases 
 whos who 
 whos norma 
 constantly no in all serious ness its really good its fun writing again im happy here honest i am 
 dont you sometimes hate yourself 
 sure especially with lots of music underneath drowning it out 
 it will 
 i mean this is good dialogue along in here it will play 
 whats good about it i miss him something fierce 
 good 
 and heres a title an apple for the teacher 
 oh you 
 came on back let me show you where it fits in 
 so do i 
 are you kidding because i think its good 
 and dont make it too dreary how about this for a situation she teaches daytimes he teaches at night right they dont even know each other but they share the same room its cheaper that way as a matter of fact they sleep in the same bed in shifts of oourse 
 honest to goodness i hate you 
 you are on your own stop being chickenhearted and write that story 
 you are tough all right 
 look betty it cant be done its out 
 nobody can be that busy 
 its just impossible 
 i think so they are on location in arizona shooting a western im free every evening every week end if you want we could work at your place 
 good for you you have got yourself the best guy in town 
 we are engaged 
 what has artie to do with it 
 couldnt we work in the evenings six oclock in the morning this next month im completely at your disposal artie is out of town 
 im all tied up i cant 
 im not good enough to write it alone we will have to do it together 
 sorry its your baby now 
 i will make it short 
 look if you dont mind i havent got time to listen to the whole plot 
 now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school the first time they meet 
 check 
 this story is about teachers their threadbare lives their struggles here are people doing the most important job in the world and they have to wprry about getting enough money to resole their shoes to me it can be as exciting as any chase any gunplay 
 psychopaths sell like hotcakes 
 see if they make sense to begin with i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff exploring a killers sick mind 
 what about all those ideas you had 
 you know id take you up on that in a minute im just not good enough to do it all by myself 
 if you get a hundred thousand for it you buy me a box of chocolate creams if you get an oscar i get the left foot 
 why should you do that

 i will not have it butchered 
 it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil 
 what for i can say anything i want with my eyes 
 sure you did thats what makes it great what it needs is a little more dialogue 
 i wrote that with my heart 
 maybe its a little long and maybe there are some repetitions but you are not a professional writer 
 of course it is 
 this is fascinating 
 well 
 i am not afraid read it 
 right now never let another writer read your stuff he may steal it 
 they will love it every place read it read the scene just before she has him killed 
 they will love it in pomona 
 salome what a woman what a part the princess in love with a holy man she dances the dance of the seven veils he rejects her so she demands his head on a golden tray kissing his cold dead lips 
 fair enough 
 i hate that word it is a return a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen 
 only asking i didt know you were planning a comeback 
 who else 
 and you will play salome 
 we have made a lot of pictures together 
 uhhuh 
 its the story or salome i think i will have demille direct it 
 looks like enough for six impor tant pictures 
 this is to be a very important picture i have written it myself took me years 
 depends on what it is a donald duck or joan or arc 
 how long is a movie script these days i mean how many pages 
 or teach it a better tune 
 the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ i ought to have it taken out 
 sure have the last one i wrote was about cattle rustlers before they were through with it the whole thing played on a torpedo boat 
 and you have written pictures havent you 
 i think thats what it says on my drivers license 
 are you or arent you 
 why 
 you are a writer you said 
 yeah 
 just a minute you 
 get out 
 ssh you will wake up that monkey 
 you are writing words words you have made a rope of words and strangled this businessl but there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles and technicolor to photograph the red swollen tongue 
 dont get sore at me im not an executive im just a writer 
 look at them in the front offices the master minds they took the idols and smashed them the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos and who have they got now some nobodies a lot of pale little frogs croaking pishposhl 
 thats where the popcorn business comes in you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears 
 they are dead they are finished there was a time when this busi ness had the eyes of the whole wide world but that wasnt good enough oh nol they wanted the ears of the world too so they opened their big mouths and out came talk talk talk 
 i knew there was something wrong with them 
 i am big its the pictures that got small 
 i know your face you are norma desmond you used to be in pictures you used to be big

 i sure turned into an interesting driveway 
 she was the greatest you wouldnt know you are too young in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters men would bribe her mani curist to get clippings from her fingernails there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings later he strangled himself with it

 in this big old house on orchard avenuebut you better stay away from there 
 thats the power source that was lost from argo city thats what i came to find where does she live 
 i know what it is she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle inside theres a silvery ring 
 theres something very dangerous about her something evil 
 she will forget about us eventually 
 arent you forgetting about selena 
 why not you are a goodlooking girl and im available 
 are you asking me for a date 
 hey listen when all this blows over maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other and maybe something might happen again what do you think 
 feelings are real once you have had them they are yours forever 
 but what ifit wasnt real 
 i dont see why not 
 you think so 
 and nowthe guitars are out of tune and the words dont make sense and somebody unplugged the mike 
 and now 
 what i had before whats not there now its like i woke up and found part of me wasnt there any more something that made me feel really alive and aware of things it was like for the first time in my life everything fitted together perfectlyyou and me and the world around uslike we were a wonderful song

 thats it the last tanker they are all mine now all 
 we can get to work on that oil 
 and now that supermans out of the nice guy business 
 a normal person 
 dont you see okay so you didnt kill him nobodys perfect but that stuff we ran up in the lab wasnt a complete failure after all right after gus gave it to him superman started to turn into a selfish ornery malicious conniving 
 so all we have got to do is pick up the garbage we just have to find our where in heaven krypton used to be then good old gus here contacts the vulcan satellite 
 so 
 the planet superman came from krypton 
 where did it come from 
 i just remembered the rest there isnt any more the only chunk that ever landed on earth disappeared a couple of years ago it was in this story in the daily planet 
 whats wrong 
 wait a minute shes right kryptonite i remember reading about it in an interview with him nuts 
 how shoot him you know about him and bullets not to mention knives tanks bombs 
 nice try butch but it wouldnt be effective against superman you will see now that hes pulled this stunt he will stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one too i have got to get rid of him i have got to 
 dont cry bubba 
 he ruined it that lousy dogooder he ruined it 
 i could have it all holy cats all the oil all the tankers all the pumps the goshdarn world will be out to lunch no heat no gassis this is some nifty idea 
 chicken feed if gus gorman can push the right buttons 
 we already have a supertanker 
 small potatoes 
 tomorrow the oil 
 today coffee 
 you meanyou meanvera vera the magnitude of this 
 well webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system how abouthmmmm someplace small 
 someplace where nobody knows him so they cant connect him with us 
 gus gorman this is my psychic nutritionist 
 shes not his mama either 
 somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the aerospace center and reach vulcan 
 computers talk to other computers right 
 blizzards heat waves 
 storms floods 
 it could make weather 
 but if somebody reprogrammed it it could do much more 
 vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather 
 oh right well then just shake hands 
 i dont kiss 
 get a hold of yourself vera nobody else ever will 
 thats what i want to know by whom whom 
 she will be fine

 well done miss teschmacher 
 how the hell would i know i was in high school back in those days 
 isnt that what the old canaveral guys used to call a comet on an eastwest trajectory 
 whats a curl 
 i think he said a curl 
 whatd he say before he saw a girl 
 artemis do you read me 
 supermans got something up his sleeve thats for sure we just havent figured it out isnt that right miss lane 
 game plan its fourth down and long yardage the twominute warning sounded and the balls deep in our territory how brilliant do you have to be 
 maybe we just don t know his game plan 
 i cant understand it where is he i mean he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree and now he decides to pull a disappearing act 
 he knows where the eiffel tower is olsen you do dont you kent 
 a gang of terrorists seized the eiffel tower in paris 
 give it another ten minutes if we dont hell i will tell him pete if we havent got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the N pt banner and run the picture for three columns kent i need a background story for the page N sidebar give me every thing you know about this terrorist group 
 mr white the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page 
 yes 
 and she the one you have chosen she feels as much for you 
 but you had more than that and i know it you and my father you had each other can i never have what you had 
 because that is your heritage those are the values we lived by on krypton 
 patience kalel you begin to sound like an earthling superman mother you speak only of honor of sacrifice of responsibility 
 yes but its not all i feel 
 you have been given a higher form of happiness the happiness you feel by serving others by inspiring them to 
 selfish but they get a chance at happiness cant i have that chance 
 you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest surely this is not how you repay their gratitude kalel could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream 
 i didnt ask her anything 
 the one danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might we cannot predict just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space i cannot say i am glad you asked me that 
 i asked the right question 
 the elders have of course thought long and hard about that question 
 no possibility for parole 
 and so our scientists constructed from an irreversible mathematical equation the phantom zone in it we imprisoned these three archvillains for all eternity 
 sensible enough 
 the three proved after exhaustive efforts incapable of rehabilitation now as you know we had no death penalty 
 my kind of people 
 for many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony then there appeared among us three antisocial elements what on earth are classified as criminals 
 now this i want to hear 
 as the keeper of the archives of krypton it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history 
 ahhhhhh alpha waves 
 that little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar it tracks alpha waves 
 that little black box mr luthor i mean whats it for 
 shhhhhhh

 yes but will you honor it 
 um we have made this guarantee 
 there will be no attack no attempt to overpower the terrorists 
 in return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them 
 and now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages 
 supersucker for once lex luthor was right 
 did you really believe we would give up our advantage 
 we must combine our strength 
 general 
 dont worry i will draw his fire with a few of my own 
 hes captured non 
 sentimental idiot

 yes to all of us the closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun a yellow sun the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers 
 strange i tore those metal fibers like paper and what he did was amazing something is happening 
 free 
 free 
 lacy i 
 maybe if youd have met who i am now instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago it would have been different between us 
 you will find a good man lacy you deserve one 
 you know strong gentle tall men with bright blue eyes and square men who like to dance slow the old fashioned way the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom 
 like me 
 any more like you back home clark 
 im not so sure you do 
 you dont have to be polite clark i have got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me 
 im sorry to see you go 
 daddys offered me jobs at some of his other companies but i have been thinking maybe i will take some time off im going to find a place like smallville in the country maybe a farm see what the slow lane is like 
 no mind its only antique irish linen 
 gee im really sorry 
 lets sit down they walk to the table lois calls out to the balcony 
 hi is dinner ready im famished 
 clark 
 oh my 
 but they are expecting us it wouldnt be polite 
 i missed you it wasnt any fun up there with just lois and superman they are so boring lets go do something wild 
 oh right i will be back in a flash 
 shouldnt you pay the cabbie 
 let me get my purse 
 hello lacy can anybody break a twenty the cabbie didnt have any change 
 come early the view is so romantic from my balcony 
 gee i dont think 
 i will just invite them both to my hotel suite and we will have high tea its very chic 
 yes i know im sure it will be a great story 
 then prove it lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission 
 im not avoiding you i have been very busy and i like you i really do 
 hes a jerk i never noticed it before seems like a lot of people i know are jerks maybe you think the same thing about me thats why you keep avoiding me 
 if you say so here goes 
 now you try clark we will start you off with N pounds 
 dont give up this is a perfect subject for your series on young metropolis now lets get those knees up 
 maybe i should sit this one out 
 dont worry i have got you 
 i feel kind of lightheaded 
 no realistic theres no magic in the world girls just dont get swept off their feet anymore 
 that sounds kind of pessimistic 
 dont tell me you are waiting for lightning to strike wideeyed romantics are an endangered species 
 well my career takes up a lot of my time 
 what about here 
 oh no theres no one back home 
 thats not what we were taught look out for number one thats daddys golden rule he always ends up with the gold 
 no metropolis is a confusing place back in smallville my hometown everything was more simple people would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand 
 my prom was so boring we all flew to paris the next day to recover sometimes my whole life seems boring i thing maybe i should just give everything away and go live among the poor people then i remember how smashing i look in sable oh its all so confusing you think im silly dont you 
 actually i had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom 
 dont tell me you learned to dance at church socials 
 this is metropolis after hours this is what you will be writing about cmon lets dance 
 i have never been in a place like this before 
 oh clark you are so delightfully primitive 
 gosh im sorry we better get in line 
 you are late very late 
 dont worry i wont make you do it alone i know all the right places im a member at all the right clubs we will start tonight at the grand opening of the metro club its a date 
 they make my eyes itch 
 thats just it you dont have to flaunt it you are no slave to fashion although 
 and im usually in bed by tenthirty 
 but you are perfect for it you are young you are single you are successful 
 i really dont think 
 its brilliant daddy thinks so too you will write a new series metropolis after hours 
 well im feeling a lot better almost chipper and all because i had a visit from a very good nurse 
 it must have been a super effort to get out of bed clark 
 you know him so well but im sure he will manage wherever he is 
 everyones saying hes dead but i know that isnt true i feel it in my heart i think he just needs help 
 superman has something happened to him 
 you havent been at work you didnt call the office you didnt even call me how could you not call back 
 its just a bad flu really how did you know 
 clark its lois this is the fourth message i have left where are you 
 please leave your message at the beep 
 politely 
 its her fathers grey matter thats weakened if you ask me how can i ask superman such a dumb question 
 are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense 
 i dont think fan mail fits this letter read it clark 
 oh probably just a picture request i will take care of it if you want lois 
 you always overreact clark how terrible can it be 
 the president is about to speak i dont think its going to be good news 
 clark wait 
 i dont think we are being treated fairly lois and im going to tell miss warfield 
 no paris 
 au contraire mon ami he owns all those sleazy tabloids and the daily planet 
 that tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids 
 regardez voila monsieur david warfield 
 gee guys thats swell of you but i have got another idea 
 lex we all appreciate how you have supported us lately and uh in recognition of your hard work we have decided to increase your commission to N percent 
 if my plan works gentlemen i will just take a tiny commission something appropriate a number with a lot of zeros after it 
 and what do we get out of it 
 do people die in italian operas gentlemen if all goes to plan nuclear man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to pierce supermans skin he will be mortal he will get sick and we will dance on his grave 
 and this socalled nuclear man of yours can defeat superman 
 boys old lex has a secret recipe in this dish call it a genetic stew you help me place it on one of your missiles and i promise you if superman throws it into the sun he will get the biggest surprise of his life i will be able to introduce superman to his first nightmare a nuclear man 
 and what am i a shriner no if you will join forces with me together we can make the world safe for war profits again 
 but superman isnt an average man 
 of course it is do you know what the sun is why its just one huge nuclear bomb a bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like that 
 close the curtains the sun is hurting my eyes 
 good if you can see it and i can see it maybe some day everyone will see it 
 but you cant tell where one country begins and another ends you cant see any borders its just one world 
 go on 
 well i see the ocean currents and the rain and mountains and rivers but 
 i will try 
 jeremy i need you to tell the people of the world what you see 
 awesome 
 nnoi meanyou bet 
 would you mind waiting for me in the visitors gallery 
 absolutely 
 would you mind taking a walk with me 
 im sorry 
 well i dont understand 
 im going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world i promise you for it is they and not i that represent the people of earth 
 but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away what good was my letter 
 because i made a vow never to interfere in the destiny of your planet 
 impossible why 
 dont be overdramatic young lady what kind of disaster could we help bring about 
 no daddy our business is journalism we cant continue to be so irresponsible or else we will just lead everyone into a disaster 
 less sensational papers go broke i thought i taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business 
 id just like to have a little less sensationalism 
 tone down our headlines lacy thats all the common man reads 
 stuff it 
 yes darling 
 daddy 
 didnt we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help now that you are the publisher 
 i know daddy im worried about him 
 darling its good riddance let her go and while you are at it fire that clark kent he hasnt been here in days he hasnt even called 
 your grandfather had one iron rule thats stood me well never fraternize with the help keep too your own station am i clear 
 oh no i mean we just went dancing for a story 
 clark kent you socialized with him a reporter 
 who does clark kent think he is anyway he never even said good night 
 mr white come with me i want to see 
 not so fast all trips are canceled we pay for wire services and what we dont get from them we will invent 
 it always is with clark 
 he was getting on and then this man with luggage and oh its a long story 
 wheres clark 
 our other dinner guest 
 whats that 
 something wonderful 
 whats he going to say 
 why lois i didnt know who is he 
 but hes never there 
 right you want to tell him how you feel 
 and your heart beats faster just thinking about him 
 lois have you ever fallen for a guy and hes not like other guys hes different its like you come from two different worlds 
 thats because theres nothing to figure out now will you please pay attention im not through insulting your father 
 clark hes late again i cant figure him out 
 who 
 i know im not exactly a girl scout but maybe if i show him im trying he will like me 
 daddy loves to whip up campaigns people eat it up we will make this kid a celebrity the whole world will be waiting for supermans answer 
 an angle 
 i think theres an angle 
 superman gets mail here 
 this letter was addressed to superman care of me 
 and very nave 
 but all men like me lois im very rich 
 forget it princess clark is the worlds oldest boy scout trustworthy loyal obedient helpful and i dont remember the rest but hes them too and i promise hes not interested in anyone like you 
 i think hes kind of cute 
 one hundred percent and i like him that way 
 is he for real 
 lucky i brought my drums 
 never but we have to hide out for a while lay low say a couple of years by then i will have a new plan 
 you think he will find us 
 if you need us we will be five hundred feet underground waiting for the nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring 
 ready uncle lex 
 dont worry honey im sure he will make a swell husband 
 i think he has his own plan uncle lex 
 this wasnt in the plan 
 we will all fry 
 my nephew leonard he worships me lets share a toast to you a nice guy whos about to finish last 
 boy are you gonna get it 
 what 
 of course thats his one vulnerability the one way he can be stopped 
 good lets hope he stays that way 
 hes cold 
 hmm nuclear levitation now thats a trick that could come in handy 
 didnt you see it he lifted me up and crashed me down 
 what was that about 
 you are just an experiment freako 
 hey just remember i made you 
 hes beautiful perfect 
 hey he looks normal 
 there 
 you are spookin me out uncle lex 
 not how i might have put it but correct the remains i sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory he will remember everything that he experienced not to worry he will find his way back to me did you hear that 
 the one superman wrecked up 
 oh leonard when i sent the remains of my last experiment 
 hey uncle lex hows the nuclear guy goin to find his way here 
 get the box nephew 
 gee uncle lex i was just getting to the good part 
 i must have miscalculated how 
 superman broke your monster uncle lex 
 lets try to keep your iq a family secret leonard before we launch him against superman we have to test him see how well he does with mayhem and destruction kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala and once he proves himself then 
 gee uncle lex i dont think this guys much of a dancer 
 he has all of supermans powers if i have planned it right 
 whoa 
 quiet you will make him selfconscious 
 he missed the door uncle lex 
 that hair contains a sample of supermans genetic material the building blocks of his body with my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes i will create a being with all his powers but with absolute allegiance to me 
 but why the hair 
 i look at you lenny and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate 
 a toupee that flies 
 do you realize what i can create with a single strand of supermans hair 
 lenny you pathetic product of the public school system your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration destroying superman 
 are we going to skip the country uncle lex 
 i am master now 
 stop i command you you mutant 
 destiny 
 me now with superman dead and you on my team its like im the coach and you are the best power forward ever what could i have to fear 
 what do you fear 
 nice bit you are good with my brain and your well frankly brawn the possibilities are staggering i could be emperor king did you see how scared those guys were 
 first i have fun 
 nifty huh goodnight sweet prince parting is inevitable now destroy superman 
 wait not yet back 
 destroy superman 
 i made you and i can destroy you 
 i am an experiment i am freako 
 you are nothing i am father now 
 what a genius an inspiration 
 you are 
 i hadnt counted on this but of course the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat i am a 
 for dignity my reputation is at stake just put it on 
 what i need this for 
 no its the way it always is on the brink with good fighting evil 
 but but isnt the world about to be osterized 
 high school physics luthor while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun it must have been his source of energy 
 but how could you beat him 
 right good tell you what we will wait right here till you get back 
 i will deal with you later 
 still having delusions lex luthor 
 superman but you are dead 
 a mind is a terrible thing to waste lex luthor and you have wasted yours on this foul monstrosity im taking you in 
 nobody wants war id just like to keep the threat alive 
 youd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains 
 precisely and then it came to me my greatest ever plan i made a deal with some minor league bad boys arms dealers renegades generals you know the type with you gone we will make a fortune rearming the world 
 which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun 
 i will ignore that so i created a monster who didnt work nearly as well as i might have liked you were clearly his better he needed more energy more power 
 im not going anywhere 
 no no listen i escaped with only one thing on my mind the end of superman 
 your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state luthor 
 you have broken all the laws of man luthor and now you have broken the laws of nature i assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles i hurled into the sun 
 look closely at his cell structure see anything familiar 
 why because i want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block 
 its common knowledge you hate children and animals why are you back in metropolis 
 know something you are a workaholic a good guy N hours a day stop and smell the roses sometime take up a hobby get a pet a kitten or a puppy 
 if you have any social skills you have learned them from a rattlesnake just what are you up to 
 silly me how do i ever think i can fool the super guy you are right no bomb i just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call i confess i tricked you hey you look great 
 luthor i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb youd be far away from here by now 
 guess who its your old friend lex 
 not you you tell me again 
 me 
 got it otis 
 yes mr luthor the xkN can travel anywhere in the world undetected it also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it it just goes around it or over it the xkN never quits it will not stop until it reaches its pretargeted target 
 one of them should have been you 
 yes so well werner would have gotten to that too but but the xkN flies only eight feet above the groundwell below the radar limit so what we could have done that soon we had ways to make people ta ways to avoid the radar and this xkN they think its so smart that they keep it in missile silos underground hah we kept many things underground 
 thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of 
 albert 
 its very simple otis very simple the xkN rocket its nothing forty years ago we in the fatherland were working on this five more years we would have had it but then that silly warwhy my cousin werner had already 
 and stop interrupting his is the big scene your finest hour you rose to the challenge baby and you lost thats the best part 
 but mr luthor sir i already 
 we are running out of smoke 
 ah the guest of honor at last and about time too 
 otherwise you are a mongoloid idiot its reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion and 
 thank you 
 you are a great architect albert 
 hes thirtyfive years old 
 that the planet blew up on may N N that the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach earth ergo 
 shut up applepolisher 
 nobody else 
 ahhhh my favorite part of the day who else could have thought of this aquarium 
 wonderful otis will go above and steal some big macs 
 theres some slice american cheeseanda half a bottle of club soda i think 
 i take the man out of argentina and it was no picnic finding him yknow and what does he think about bunkers still living in the past when i am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world

 why would he do that how would he know i was going to suddenly slip 
 look there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce 
 he grabbed me he held me he set me down gently how could that be done with mirrors 
 mirrors then its done with mirrors

 it was done with wires they must have rigged him like they do with peter pan 
 clark kent if you had only seen it the way i did you

 of course i can i love you 
 you cant do this to me 
 what other one 
 i mean the other one 
 im wearing it 
 good fine now wheres my parachute 
 miss teschmacher superman is a fairly bright individual my understanding of the way he works is that he wont be fooled by a simple trick 
 wheres mine wheres my parachute 
 lex is going byebye 
 danger somebody lex where are you going 
 he always shows up when somebodys in danger 
 what if he doesnt show up what if hes taking a nap 
 you got wax in your ears 
 tea 
 nothing nothing i just want to invite him to tea 
 what are you going to do to him 
 not exactly but its his kind of neighborhood 
 oh why does he live up here 
 i didnt bring any 
 your volcano chum your junior lifesaving buddy lets get high 
 this all has something to do with superman doesnt it 
 yours not to reason why miss teschmacher relax enjoy it just look at that smog 
 i dont understand 
 baby im going to take you higher 
 a night on the town instead of under it 
 she knows clever very clever and unappreciated but im going to take you away from all this 
 i know 
 you have been under such a strain and i have i have neglected you mea culpa yknow 
 i knew youd hit me 
 hit you a clever girl like you he turned slowly slowly in the lava was how you described it now thats clever i have to hand it to you 
 you are not going to hit me 
 something you can feed the pets perhaps lets have it 
 there was a recipe on the back 
 no news is not good news yknow 
 you have two minutes and thirty two seconds 
 you how about me 
 dont let me down 
 nothing 
 but if i put my leg out like claudette clobert in 
 they stop for nothing 
 ready 
 ready 
 is that an innuendo miss teschmacher because if it is you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle 
 you ever try to run in high heels you probably did 
 weak sister i still cant figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out yknow 
 i dont like to talk about it lex 
 about vesuvius about superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano ahh the look on his face when he saw that kryptonite when will i see another yknow yknow 
 the least we can do is leave him another door jam 
 what do you suggest my dear 
 we just take it 
 the door jam miss teschmacher this ethiopian shmendrick here in his simple unconscious way needed something to wedge the door open the better to inhale the flies that form such an important part of his diet so he grabs something from the table 
 you are not going to tell us why you are happy are you 
 la de da da 
 you are happy arent you 
 i will as soon as i get the sand out of my nose 
 breathe that air miss teschmacher 
 no you are going to get kissed 
 i know im going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this but so what 
 tune me in lady an explosion such as the one superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the krypton rock 
 i dont mean to denigrate your misspent youth lex but what does that rock have to do with 
 ahh national geographic in my day this made playboy look like mother goose 
 bingo 
 meteorites 
 deductive reasoning my friends thats the name of the game what does it say here 
 mr romance 
 stay and listen besides its twelve in the afternoon this is no time to go to bed 
 im going to bed 
 see i see its you who dont see doesnt see i cannot believe it how you people fail to grasp the longrange significance of this yknow 
 see 
 exactly miss teschmacher 
 i read the article 
 some people can read war and peace and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe yknow 
 krypton the place where superman comes from 
 krypton 
 when it gets to seventyfive below stabilize it 
 fifty degrees below and still falling 
 whats the temperature now 
 place your bets ladies and gentlemen 
 damn this will get him 
 i didnt say a word 
 shut up 
 you are on 
 bet he makes it 
 tough guy huh 
 nuts he made it 
 hes from another world 
 you think hes for real 
 i needed this yknow i really needed this just when im nearing the fruition of my project big bird flies into town go ahead kill me by inches put me on the agony rack 
 first the pets otis 
 again 
 what about dinner i have to worry about the crime of the century thats all yknow am i supposed to worry about whats in the refrigerator too whats in it 
 speaking of feeding things what about dinner 
 even that would be an improvement 
 you will be seeing stars in a minute miss teschmacher yknow 
 streets sunlight when was the last time i saw sunlight 
 criers and complainers thats what i get moaners and groaners me lex luthor who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes lex luthor who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea so to speak hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above 
 so i have noticed 
 compared to what came before a year of living in the sewers a part of that will always be with me 
 this 
 i know that bu tin this case he was right arnold buster luthor the most inept check forger of his time a pity he didnt live to see his son strike out for the big city a pity he didnt live to see how from humble beginnings i created an empire 
 your father was a sick weirdo 
 my father always said to me son dont invest your money in anything but land land stocks rise and fall banks fall people are no damn good but they will always need land and for that they will pay through the nose aremember that my father said land 
 why does it all mean so much to you all the time land land land 
 so its six hundred feet below park avenue its still a park avenue address 
 it isnt a park avenue address really 
 me and my real estate how many other girls miss teschmacher are lucky enough to have a park avenue address like this 
 you and your real estate 
 neither my wife nor i will attempt to leave krypton 
 will you abide by the councils opinion 
 if you persist you leave us no choice 
 as an irredeemable criminal you compare me to them 
 and if i dont obey 
 this discussion is terminated the decision of the council is final you will cease pursuing this matter any attempt by you to continue to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace will be deemed an act of insurrection 
 i have sworn to uphold the laws of krypton 
 but so is vondel 
 then 
 you are one of kryptons greatest scientists jorel 
 my friends i am not a rash impulsive person im not given to wild unsupported statements we must evacuate this planet immediately 
 jorel be warned this tone of yours approaches insolence 
 but you cant ignore these facts its suicide worse than that its genocide 
 on the salary he pays me i cant make my rent without it 
 need i ask whos favored to collect at the end of this week 
 its because im an intrepid girl reporter jimmy besides the chief of detectives has the hots for me 
 how come you get all the good stories lois 
 gets you where you live huh 
 boy 
 and the people on the street the little man who runs the corner newsstand the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare 
 two 
 an ode to spring are there one or two ts in bloodletting 
 what are you writing lois 
 i bless the day you came to us son you know that but some people wouldnt understand 
 what your mother means clark is that she dont want folks to think you are special 
 oh dear that isnt what i

 i was thinkin what to call him i was thinkin i had an uncle who was a fine man you recall him the church sexton 
 guess id better hitch up the rig and come back to get thatthat thing he was settin in what do you make of that thing martha you listening 
 we will say hes a child to my cousin in north dakota and just now orphaned poor thing 
 folks will ask question 
 all these years happy as we have been how i prayed and prayed hed see fit to give us a child and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot no one must ever know

 the good lord works in mysterious ways 
 all of us

 i want to know what my child is going to face 
 you have been doing some research in the archives 
 well physiologically he wont quite fit 
 he will be odd different 
 yes true but on other worlds there would be other problems heat cold no life no life support systemsno lara believe me earth is the least of evils on earth his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless that cant be helped but with his denser molecular structure he will also be strong he will be fast he will be virtually invulnerable 
 he will be weightless 
 their atmosphere will sustain him he will look like one of them 
 a million years behind us jorel hes only a baby 
 they are primitive lara but they are not animals

 what about it 
 what about this xray vision of yours 
 N pounds 
 how much do you weigh 
 thirtyfive 
 how old are you 
 its not bad 
 it must feel great 
 the reason i can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that i have a lighter density under earths gravitational force 
 oh 
 i wouldnt do that its against the law 
 well i mean its not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it 
 i guess they are a little odd 
 i didnt mean that in any pejorative way

 wellflashlight 
 unlisted number shall we proceed 
 this is incredible i was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you i mean you dont have an answering service right 
 theres been a lot of confusion in the media about who i am and what im up to and all that id like to set the record straight with your help 
 the answer is yes now whats the question 
 i came to talk to you 
 whawhat are you doing here 
 right on the first guess 
 superman 
 not a chance its too nice a night 
 with my luck now it will rain 
 lets just say im a friend and watch yourself from now on with those things okay i mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings 
 whowho 
 not while im around you are not cmon 
 oh god im going to die 
 do as i say let go 
 you have got me whos got you 
 easy now miss i have got you 
 good enough for you now then tell me something i like to hear as many times as i hear it 
 sort of 
 ah dear simple otis albert explain it to him 
 i still dont get it 
 oh mr luthor 
 cleaning a rock otis jot it down as soon as we are back he feeds the pets 
 maybe its being polished or something maybe they are cleaning it 
 they are killing me by inches go ahead make me suffer milk me dry 
 its a twinkie boss 
 well gents what did i tell you its a piece of cake 
 will kill him and im going to have a piece of the rock miss teschmacher pack your 
 you mean bullets and fire and all that cant hurt him but this kind of rock 
 but to someone from the planet krypton this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity kryptonite ah kryptonite thats the stuff 
 yknow im sure of it yknow and theres a strong streak of goody goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if i dont do something about it something 
 it is for me 
 is that real enough for you 
 otis 
 please 
 i guess iuhregressed 
 and now he lies to me he has been stealing ladies purses again havent you havent you you miserable petty crook 
 iuhcheck 
 i gave him this new face 
 i will never forget you for that mr luthor 
 i gave him steady employment 
 i will always be grateful mr luthor 
 i broke the man out of prison 
 otis were you up to your old tricks 
 matter with me nothings the matter 
 whats the matter otis 
 excellent otis but what took you so long 
 did i do good mr luthor 
 not there a pine tree in death valley idiot this is for the north woods section 
 there 
 yessir just what you wanted 
 now then otis did you get what i asked for 
 no speeches otis just watch what albert has prepared what are you waiting for 
 iuh 
 we will see how fast i can fly 
 now whos the dreamer superman even you cant fly that fast 
 for the first time today superman i must tell you that you are wrong but how could you know that oh well i guess i could tell you now ysee actuallybut this conversation is becoming rather dry isnt it 
 well its very impressive but you built this junk for nothing 
 in a way oh it will be a relief im a wreck no rest for the wicked yknow it wasnt enough the radio frequencies then i had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming so that if i could have activated the launch well lex luthor would have hit the spot theres a little place on route N dead on the practice optimum stress point of the san andreas fault it wouldnt mean much to you superman but i call ittarget zero panchos taco palace 
 they will soon be over 
 well thats their problem ts but but the xk N also works on a radio wave control system the problem was to find out the frequency problems problems i have had so many 
 you guessed it you are always one step ahead of me arent you superman yes right there was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors the minute the signal went out zip zip zip 
 luthor 
 and garbage doors 
 on radio waves 
 still foolishly perhaps i had a theory that eliminates the presidential pushbutton i was doing my homework 
 i know i know i never promised myself a rose garden 
 the xk N luthor that operates on radio waves and with our failsafe system only the president himself can push that button 
 you are right you are right superman there were wrinkles to iron out but well there is this new rocket the xk N 
 it wouldnt hurt you cant go on living in fantasies did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb and drop it why our strategic defense boys would have 
 maybe i should get help 
 it would never have worked luthor you are a dreamer a sick twisted dreamer 
 dropped into the sea byebye california hello new west coast gold coast my coast and nowwell i left my heart in san francisco 
 nice most of california would have been destroyed millions of people would have been killed the west coast as we know it would have 
 couldnt have said it better myself now all this west of the fault is the most expensive real estate in the world los angeles san diego san francisco and here is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land land that happens to be owned by lex luthor enterprises well call me a fool but it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the san andreas fault to do its thing ah it would have been so nice yknow 
 sure its the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago the fault line itself is unstable and always shifting which is the reason you get earthquakes in the california area from time to time 
 at the san andreas fault maybe you have heard of it 
 right right where was i ah yes 
 of time luthor 
 its just that i spent a fortune on these things and all for naught what a waste 
 no superman of course not you do get around dont you 
 i dont need a geography lesson luthor 
 this is california the richest most populous state in america and growing like a sonofagun 
 oh that listen you are busy and its a long story 
 plenty about the crime of the century remember 
 well you have got me what can i say 
 butwhy 
 makes cecil b demille look like the senior class play right 
 what is this 
 i will tell her that 
 i hope she gets better

 what happened 
 i didnt know i was in a panic i guessed shed been bitten by an insect but there was no doctor the nearest hospital was forty miles away and zoe was continuing to swell klara took her in her arms and tried to breastfeed her while i dialed the hospital i finally got a doctor on the line he sounded young but cool he was confident but there was a nervousness he have been an intern this was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this he wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing but he was just as scared as i was 
 what happened 
 i woke to the sound of zoes breathing it was laboured i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen i grabbed her rushed to the kitchen and splashed water on her face 
 idont think so 
 thats okay 
 imso sorry 
 it turns to steaming piss 
 whatdoes it turn to 
 yes do you find theres something strange about this meat 
 shes in trouble

 other clinics oh sure clinics halfway houses treatment centers detox units 
 so there were others 
 sunnyridge that was a long time

 im telling you this because we have all lost our children mr ansel 
 why are you telling me this 
 thats my daughter or it may be the police to tell me that they have found her dead shes a drug addict 
 i know risa and wendell walker they wouldnt hire a goddamned lawyer and the ottos wouldnt deal 
 the walkers have agreed the ottos nicole burnells parents its important to initiate proceedings right away things get covered up people lie thats why we have to begin our investigation quickly before the evidence disappears thats why im out here tonight 
 case 
 you can help each other several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit your case as an individual will be stronger if im allowed to represent you together as a group 
 leave us alone stephens leave the people of this town alone you cant help 
 no mr ansel i wouldnt sue you 
 mr mitchell stephens esquire would you be likely to sue me if i was to beat you right now beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldnt walk for a month because thats what im about to do 
 not unless you can raise the dead 
 i can help you 
 no you dont 
 i understand 
 mister i dont want to know your name 
 my name is 
 goodnight nicole 
 goodnight mr ansel 
 oh right 
 im not sure 
 what do you mean outgrown it 
 and she really liked you she would have given you all this if shed outgrown it or 
 no i mean i remember mrs ansel wearing some of this stuff buti dont feel funny about that i really liked her 
 nicole im just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity dont feel bad unless you feel strange about wearing it 
 i dont know 
 why 
 it just seemskind of weird 
 yeah 
 are you sure 
 okay 
 i will be back around nine 
 was it good 
 they just finished supper 
 hi mr ansel hi jessica mason 
 hi nicole 
 say hello for me 
 shes resting in her room 
 how is nicole is she around 
 the children 
 billy please the children 
 i used to like it here i used to care about what happened now i think i will sell my house and move the fuck away 
 because i was driving behind the bus mary because i saw it i saw it happen 
 why would he do that you didnt have anything to do with the accident 
 im sorry 
 i will help pay for nicole if thats what you are really talking about i will even give you the money i got for my kids thats what we used to do remember help each other this was a community 
 its not enough for hospital bills for nicole 
 why you got money from dolores insurance with the school board we all did 
 no billy we cant drop the lawsuit you know how much we need the money 
 we have got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards we have got people pointing fingers making side deals and dickering over percentages yesterday i heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad the rescue squad because they didnt act fast enough 
 cmon you know that wont 
 thats wrong sam you know that we will be tangled up in this thing for the next five years this is never going to go away 
 that wont happen billy mitch stephens case is small compared to some of those other guys the way he told me all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day driving behind the bus i know its a painful thing to do but it will only take a few minutes of your time that will be the end of it 
 if that bastard does subpoena me if he forces me to go over this again then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing 
 but yours is the one whos going to subpoena me sam force me to testify in court he came by the garage this afternoon gave me this piece of paper 
 so i mean lots of folks have got lawyers 
 i have tried to stay out of it but it turns out thats not so easy sam you have gone and got yourself this lawyer mitchell stephens you and risa and wendell and the ottos 
 okay fine sostay out of it 
 well i dont want a damned thing to do with it 
 because its what we have to do 
 why not 
 well it being so depressing and all but its reality you cant just turn this off because you happen to think its a bad idea 
 how 
 well i dont know why it should theres a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits we are hardly unique here billy i mean i can understand how you feel 
 it does concern me 
 i dont see how that concerns you billy 
 well sam i might as well tell you the truth its this lawsuit you have gotten yourself all involved with i want you to drop the damned thing 
 so what brings you out tonight 
 you think that caused the accident risa that it brought bad luck christ it sounds to me you are looking for a witch doctor not a lawyer or maybe they are the same thing 
 why did you do that billy 
 yes 
 is it true that you gave nicole one of lydias dresses that she was wearing it when the bus crashed 
 well i dont 
 because i have to 
 why 
 i have to 
 you believe that 
 or that the guardrail wasnt strong enough 
 risa i serviced that bus at the garage theres nothing wrong with it 
 mr stephens says that someone didnt put a right bolt in the bus 
 something made this happen billy mr stephens is going to find out what it was 
 i stopped by the station a while ago i stared at the bus i could almost hear the kids inside there was a lawyer there he told me hed gotten you signed up is that true 
 good night 
 good night billy 
 i better get back 
 you are leaving 
 just like we look forward to this 
 sure 
 they can look forward to that 
 well maybe thats because they know im going to follow them behind the bus 
 your kids never cry 
 its natural 
 yes 
 thats because he misses you 
 tomorrow im going to put sean on the bus he wont want to go he never does he will cry and want to hold on to me 
 what are you thinking 
 when the games over i guess 
 what times he coming home 
 no it should be dry by now 
 does this mean i cant take a shower 
 billy do you have to smoke wendell can smell if someones been smoking 
 a while 
 have you been waiting long 
 cant you make it later 
 she said shes got to be home by nine 
 billy thats too early 
 nicoles coming over to look after the kids tonight she will be there around six 
 i dont know but it was weird in terms of what happened next sean was still watching his mother 
 why would he be frightened 
 he never took his eyes off his mother even as he moved to sit beside nicole he looked frightened 
 yes abbot understands these things 
 thats what he said is it 
 there might have been a word or two that slipped by maybe you could clarify it for me just to be absolutely sure 
 anything you didnt understand 
 yes 
 you heard what abbott said 
 whos been talking to you about what im feeling who should care about what im feeling 
 excuse me 
 what other people 
 its clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event 
 mrs driscoll if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect 
 and billy told you that he will tell that to 
 i did 
 you have talked to billy 
 billy said that 
 yes he does 
 he knows that billy 
 billy ansel will insist that you were driving fiftyone miles an hour just like you have done every morning for the past fifteen years 
 because id be to blame right 
 that would complicate things 
 i told you that i was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened thats how i remembered it but the truth is i might have been doing sixty or sixty five and if thats true that i was over the limit when the bus went over what would happen then 
 whats that dolores 
 i have a question for you mr stephens 
 the walkers loved sean he was their only childthe object of all their attention i mean wendells a withdrawn sort of man thats his nature but risa shes still got dreams 
 did they give him special care 
 what do you mean 
 did his parents attend to that 
 thats right 
 you mentioned that he had a learning disability 
 what do you mean 
 were his parentsattentive to him 
 a strange little fellow but you couldnt help liking him he was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six 
 with our hands 
 and whats that 
 yes the oldfashioned way 
 berrypicking 
 abbott and i used to do a lot of that in the spring 
 yes like i was putting them into my big basket clearing the hillside of its children 
 berries 
 thats the way i thought of them sometimes 
 no i saw it on his face 
 you talked about it 
 no nothing like that billys wife lydia died of cancer a few years ago he took over raising the children by himself it was obvious how much he missed lydia 
 did he have any particular problems that you knew of financial pressuresrunins with the law 
 from what 
 from what 
 billy loved to see his kids in the bus they always sat in the back so they could wave to each other it comforted him 
 for rabbits 
 those are all from the fair last year abbott and me were judges at the pet show 
 oh yes like i said they always came out together to see him off to school its like he was their little treasure he was such a beautiful boy thats a picture of him on the wall there behind abbott 
 and they loved bear 
 no nothing like that the ottos are what id call model citizens they are regular at town meetings they give their opinions in a respectful way they always help out at various fundraising bazaars in town though they arent church goers 
 do they have any reputation for drugs 
 i mean the way they look their hair and clothing 
 yes what do you mean by hippies 
 about the ottos 
 what do you mean by that dolores 
 dolores no one calls me mrs driscoll 
 the ottos always waited for the bus with bear they were the only parents who did that together like that i guess they are what you might call hippies 
 away from your crazy mom 
 oh its bizarre alright cmon bear lets get you out of here 
 its for the school bazaar 
 i will just strap it on the roof 
 i could wrap it up protect the other kids 
 i didnt say that 
 you hate it 
 well its certainly what youd call interesting 
 what do you think 
 hi dolores 
 good morning wanda hi hartley 
 i willtake it straight 
 we have only got honey 
 no a little sugar though 
 i didnt ask if you wanted milk 
 how long has dolores been driving that bus mr otto how many times has she steered clear of danger what went wrong that morning 
 but dolores said she saw a dog and tried to 
 a cup of tea would be nice would it be alright if i sit down for a few minutes mrs otto i want to talk to you 
 you want a cup of tea or something 
 its the truth 
 nicole 
 no whats this lawyer business 
 maybe we shouldnt be talking about this just now with you barely home arent you hungry honey want me to fix you something 
 whos mr stephens 
 no from mr stephens that was him on the phone just now he was calling to see how you were 
 from you 
 yes its a present 
 is this mine 
 i feel like a princess 
 your dad spent all his spare time in here he wanted to make it absolutely perfect 
 its interesting 
 so do you like your new room 
 we had a terrible winter last year didnt we sam 
 how was it 
 well winters far behind us now 
 and winter 
 summers over its fall 
 what happened to summer 
 isnt it a lovely day 
 he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein it wasnt i feel like his monster 
 would you like a cup of tea billy theres a piece of cake left 
 hey billy what brings you out on a night like this cmon in take a load off 
 thats what he said 
 is he coming over now right away 
 jenny its time for you to go to bed 
 was he drinking could you tell 
 no 
 did he say what about 
 that was billy ansel on the phone he wants to come over to talk to us 
 okay 
 should i keep reading 
 oh 
 no not mean justvery angry 
 so he was mean 
 yes 
 the people in the town 
 becausehe wanted to them to be punished 
 well if he knew magic if he could get the kids into the mountain why couldnt he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats 
 thats right 
 what mason 
 nicole 
 okay 
 i want to sit beside you tomorrow 
 dont you usually like to sit at the back to wave at your dad 
 can i sit beside you on the bus tomorrow 
 yes 
 nicole 
 rats they fought the dogs and killed the cats and bit the babies in the cradles and ate the cheeses out of vats and licked the soup from the cooks own ladles split open the kegs of salted sprats made nests inside mens sunday hats and even spoiled the womens chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats 
 whats vermin again 
 oh 
 its like a song 
 whats a ditty again 
 the pied piper of hamelin by famous hanover city the river weser deep and wide washes its wall on the southern side a pleasanter spot you never spied but when begins my ditty 
 unless the report from the national weather bureau for the district on january N goes into the record i will object to that question 
 it was snowing 
 so you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this its not going to be easy nicole do you understand that 
 why 
 yes doloresand even your mom and dad but i will make sure you go last 
 dolores 
 im absolutely positive 
 you seem very sure about that 
 theres no such thing as an accident nicole not in a situation like this 
 the truth is that it was an accident and no ones to blame 
 i dont want you to lie 
 i wont lie 
 they work for the people we are trying to sue their job is to try to minimize damages our job nicole is to try to maximize them you have to think of it that way as people doing their jobs no good guys or bad guys just our side and their side 
 what do you want me to do for you mr stephens 
 it would be strange if you didnt feel that way 
 yes like bear and the ansel twins and sean and 
 that you didnt die like the other children 
 you can only feel lucky that you didnt die for so long then you start to feelunlucky 
 you hate that 
 i dont like thinking about the accident i dont even remember it happening besides it just makes people feel sorry for me and 
 thank you nicole 
 i have no questions 
 and what was the weather like at this time 
 note that she said pretty clearly not clearly 
 did there come a time when the bus turned off staples mill road onto 
 note my objection she said as im talking 
 i object to that form of question note that 
 there was nothing reckless in mrs driscolls behavior 
 was the bus on time 
 i object to the form of that question note that 
 no 
 have they ever been busted

 if you agree to have me represent you in this suit i will require no payment until after the case is won when i will require one third of the awarded amount if there is no award made then my services will cost you nothing its a standard agreement 
 no 
 are you expensive 
 listen to me mrs otto listen very carefully i do know whats best 
 isnt that what you want us to believe that we are completely defenseless that you know whats best 
 excuse me 
 so you are just the thing we need 
 mrs otto there is no such thing as an accident the word doesnt mean anything to me as far as im concerned somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a tencent bolt and a million dollar outofcourt settlement they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference thats whats done mrs otto i have seen it happen so many times before 
 you think someone else caused the accident 
 its my belief that dolores was doing exactly what shed been doing for years besides the school boards insurance on dolores is minimal a few million at the very most the really deep pockets are to be found in the town or in the company that made the bus 
 dolores 
 you are angry arent you mrs otto thats why im here to give your anger a voice to be your 
 who did they get for that 
 it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger not their grief 
 their child died and they got a lawyer 
 yes 
 you have been retained 
 the walkers spoke very highly of you 
 please 
 no 
 please let me explain i will only take a moment of your time 
 you cant come here 
 im a lawyer 
 who are you 
 im sorry for coming over unannounced like this mrs otto but the walkers said you would understand i know its an awful time but its important that we talk 
 dont know food banks welfare church charity they scrape by 
 how does the family survive 
 cant get off that shitty dump they live on what little money comes in goes to booze 
 probably half a dozen traffic convictions drunk driving lost his licence thats why he dont work no more 
 any criminal record 
 been drinking since high school fucked himself up used to be smart enough 
 in what way 
 kyle lambstons a drunk nobody likes him hes a nasty piece of work 
 no 
 are you a reporter 
 i remember the bus swerved it just suddenly swerved to the right and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road and then it went over the embankment there and everyone was screaming and everything and thats all i guess i was unconscious after that thats all then i was in the hospital 
 what do you remember about the accident 
 yes i do now now that im telling it 
 you remember this 
 no because the bus went off the road and crashed 
 there wasnt time 
 i was scared and there wasnt time 
 why not 
 no 
 did you say anything to mrs driscoll 
 yes 
 you saw the speedometer 
 i told you i was positive the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was 
 you believe that the bus driven by mrs driscoll was going at seventy two miles an hour at this time 
 positive 
 seventytwo miles an hour you are sure of this 
 seventytwo miles an hour 
 how fast would you say mrs driscoll was going to the best of your recollection 
 yes i looked i remember clearly now it seemed we were going too fast down the hill i was scared 
 you could see the speedometer 
 the speedometer and it was downhill there 
 mrs driscoll was driving too fast what made you think that nicole 
 dolores was driving too fast 
 why were you scared 
 yes i understand 
 this is before the accident nicole do you understand what im asking 
 why were you scared 
 i was scared 
 yes 
 before the actual accident 
 i will offer that report well then now that your memory seems to be clearing can you tell us what else you observed at that time 
 yes 
 you are 
 there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there right by the dump and dolores slowed down not to hit him and he ran into the woods and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road as usual i remember that im remembering it pretty clearly 
 yes 
 as im talking im remembering more about it 
 you remember that much 
 yes 
 did there come a time when all the children had been picked up 
 no 
 until the accident no yes there was 
 and according to your recollection there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning 
 my usual place on the right side the first seat 
 and where did you sit that morning 
 yes 
 like what i mean i dont remember a lot 
 was there anything unusual about the driver dolores driscoll or the bus that particular morning 
 no i was alone my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day 
 was anyone waiting for the bus with you 
 about eightthirty in the morning 
 what time in the morning was this 
 yes 
 now on that morning did there come a time nicole when you left your parents house 
 someplace where no one knows her someplace strange and new 
 theres talk of that 
 she will move away 
 its too late for that she cant drive the bus anymore the school board saw to that right off 
 will the police do anything to her 
 i dont know 
 whats going to happen to dolores 
 okay 
 how about sunday night thats always the best time 
 yes 
 great 
 well okay i will take you about ninethirty in the morning thats okay with you 
 he couldnt look at me but i looked at him right at him his secret was mine now we used to share it but not anymore now i owned it completely 
 i mean im a wheelchair girl now its hard to pretend im a beautiful rock star not like you used to tell me remember daddy all the people that were going to discover me where are they now 
 what do you mean 
 you seemi dont knowwell distant i guess hard to talk to 
 great 
 nicole tomorrow mr stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse i thought id take you over 
 no 
 are you sleeping 
 as opposed to this tv 
 nothing good on your tv 
 nothing 
 what are you up to nicole 
 well mr stephens is representing several families the ottos the walkers us and i think a couple more mr stephens is suing the town for negligence hes sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right hes a very smart man 
 how will he do that 
 partly but theres a lot the insurance doesnt cover thats one of the reasons we have a lawyer to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest 
 what about insurance doesnt insurance pay for these things 
 you are going to need special care for a long time to come its not going to be easy not for you not for any of us because we love you so much and its going to cost money more than we can imagine 
 but you didnt lose me 
 its because of the accident nicole most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers a lot of peoplewell people in this town are very angry us included 
 my lawyer why do i need a lawyer 
 well yes hes your lawyer too 
 you and mom have a lawyer 
 hes a lawyer hes our lawyer 
 oh i better get some spackle 
 thats too high i will never reach it 
 sure i will fix it right away 
 the door needs a lock 
 and i had to widen a few doors you will see 
 its okay 
 do you like the colour 
 very slick 
 pretty slick eh 
 the ramp 
 how do you like it nicole 
 dont even try to remember 
 they say im lucky because i cant remember the accident 
 does it fit 
 mrs ansels clothing 
 whats that 
 nothing 
 what took so long 
 just the way dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals its like the biggest thing in her life 
 whats so funny 
 i am really it was awesome 
 you dont sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure 
 of course 
 you mean it 
 you are going to blow everyone away 
 really 
 that was great 
 you dont know that 
 yeah well they probably smoke weed 
 the ottos 
 dont even think of the bilodeaus or the atwaters they are all inbred 
 charlenes over at the spread eagle every other night sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on she will go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts 
 but charlene 
 that sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town hes about to lose his house and car

 i guess you are right but 
 not that im convinced but you will never prove it in a million years steve you will do what you want but it cant hurt he offers you an olive branch so today like olives 
 i still think hes responsible for the smear

 i want to speak to miss hunsecker please 
 excited with good reason i wanted to say because this endangers the future of the whole quintet 
 dont apologize for me frank 
 boys this gets nobody nowhere you are over excited steve and 
 i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated 
 excuse me steve i said namely you shouldnt go around wild blaming people without justification 
 you dont like it do you i think she will accept but im not sure she may be too dependent on her brother 
 did she accept 
 the next time you want information falco dont scratch for it like a dog ask for it like a man 
 come on boys break it up 
 then what are you doing here go over there and fight if van cleve fires your boy it gives a lie the ring of truth

 four five nights ago thats how i know the romance is off also steves in a very bad mood 
 thats a nice tour all booked when was susie around here last 
 coupla weeks for eight weeks

 you told him that 
 yeah and its the truth to the best of my knowledge and frankly im glad for steves sake im glad not yours i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart steve shouldnt get mixed up with no bimbo at his age 
 you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker didnt you 
 looka sidney you are my own sisters son but where does that give you the right to call me a liar

 otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you tell him not to pay any attention to anything youknowwho says about youknowwhat right otis 
 friends call me otis sometimes tricky otis 
 i see you are full of human feelings 
 and instead he printed his heel in your face 
 you dont know that lunatic yet whims egotistic whims like the gag when you got him for a friend you dont need an enemy thats what the fight with bartha was about leo i says hunsecker froze me out so im eating humble pie this month please print me an item 
 if it were that easy you wouldnt find an empty phone booth for the next two hours 
 call him up and ask he might drop dead with shock 
 how is dear old jj by the way 
 im late for a date with a dame 
 i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper hey wait a minute 
 ten will get you fifty you are playing hookey from a padded cell 
 but my day with susie isnt over yet and 
 son i dont fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns so suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day 
 why because i dont like the way you toy with human lives your contempt and malice because i wont be the accomplice of your sick ego and the way its crippled susie you think of yourself you and your column you see yourself as a national glorybut to me and thousands of others like me you and your slimy scandal your phony patriotics to me mr hunsecker you are a national disgrace 
 and what have i done to her besides not buy her a new fur coat lately sidney you were right the boys a dilly

 if looks could kill im dead 
 son you raise your voice again and you will be outa here on your golden pratt 
 im trying to get susie to stand up to you but your manner is so threatening that shes afraid to speak 
 may i lift my eyebrows what is this what are you trying to do 
 those dears sound like daggers may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak 
 susie as always is free to say anything she thinks go on dear say exactly whats on your mind dear 
 im afraid i cant cope with them 
 you hear that susie continue please 
 mr hunsecker you have got more twists than a barrel of pretzels

 right now you are in no position to ask questions and your snide remarks 
 i dont take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics whos the injured party here you 
 hes here isnt he do you think sir when he dies he will go to the dog and cat heaven 
 why do you keep coupling me with falco 
 no punch line maybe i was just admiring your knowhowyours and falcos 
 frankly son you lost me on that last hill just give us the punch line 
 well just be careful you dont knock her down huh 
 nuts im not here as an artist im here as an average joe who happens to love your sister susie 
 just exactly what are you so hot about i mean i know its a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds but 
 son lots of people tell me im a gifted man but i still cant see around corners 
 is it news to you 
 why has he bothered you before 
 does he have to be here in our hair 
 serious as a deaconi like it i like your style son in a world of old rags and bones i like it for instance take sidney 
 no i wouldnt 
 take it easy susie he wouldnt be much of a man if he didnt understand my concern would you son 
 i will by that son now you owe me a favor be good to my kid sister 
 mr hunsecker theres nothing to that smear you have my sincere word 
 you have been very kind about it mr hunsecker hunsecker give susie credit for that i took her word that there was nothing to the smear matter of fact i will have my say about smears on the show today thats why id like your personal assurance too 
 well son looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble 
 susan

 sometimes i think all men are fools 
 susie im sorry if 
 before you leave son i will answer your questionsusan hunsecker is the injured party here or will i be hearing next that i dont even have my sisters welfare at heart 
 no 
 susie did you know about this accusation 
 jj steve isnt 
 susie likes to keep her girlish secrets but in her heart of hearts i imagine dallas that she fancies you in an uncommon way now what about you son not just tomcatting aroundi hope 
 a man couldnt ask for a squarer shake let me have billy van cleve dont ever tell anyone susie how im tied to your apron strings billy jj whats this about that boy what boy where are we lug in a drawing room comedy you are brain is warming up sweetheart yeah dallas no dont explain your point of view but 
 when im certain i will let you know 
 susie i want to help you theres nothing i wont do for you you are all i have got in the whole wide world 
 im taking up the situation with you now 
 i started to say we are drifting apart a year ago in your wildest dreams would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me today i had to call you in 
 i havent said anything yet jj but if 
 let me finish dear you had your say now let me have mine 
 i thought we were talking about sidney 
 you know dear we are drifting apart you and i and i dont like that 
 i said sidney 
 who said sidney 
 sidney is a liar 
 alan was notunbalanced when i married him and he was notindifferent to women no matter what they said hunsecker im not fighting with you puss 
 i wouldnt have called the boy exactly balanced 
 then whose fault was it jj it was someones fault wasnt it 
 but that wasnt your fault dear what happened to leslie i have told you that a million times 
 its just as if i have seen a ghost today 
 history repeats itself everything that happened to alan lesliebegan with a smear like this 
 why are you trembling dear 
 no im not im not 
 not being partial are you 
 yes he phoned i dont know this boy too well anything in these charges 
 did sidney tell you about it 
 what a question dear with that newspaper in your hand 
 why 
 susie you are very much in my thoughts today 
 why does everything you say sound like a threat 
 we are friends harvey we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid congressman dont we 
 there is some allusion here that escapes me 
 this man is not for you harvey and you shouldnt be seen with him in public because thats another part of a press agents life he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space 
 now come jj thats a little too harsh anyone seems fair game for you tonight 
 now dont kid a kidder 
 and i believe thats precisely where i read it too you see jj where i get my reputation for being the bestinformed man in washington 
 yes the justice thats right but i think you had it in the column 
 errthe supreme court story i was telling you justice black 
 i remember once when you didnt quite put things together boy was the mayor mad 
 yeah i got eyes i put things together 
 say thats good its nice in fact its apt harry 
 i dont believe it 
 say hello to sidney falco tickle him hes been a bad boy tonight he called you my fat friend 
 she mighta jumped love suicide check it for me philits a real heart throb 
 yeah at bellevue still hanging on but they still dont know if she was pushed 
 incidentally what happened to that doll you gave me the item last night still alive 
 i just checked downtown quiet everywhere tonight 
 bonna sera commendatore come sta 
 hello harry 
 susie theres nothing wrong with dallas your brother and i arranged it all and if the leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life forget it your brother arranged that one too i dont usually give away presents but this is my gift to you get out of here leave this man 
 you are incapable of the truth 
 listen with care this will cost me everything so you know im telling you the truth 
 talk to her yourself 
 talk to her sidney 
 is that why you were romancing her you mutt lets call it quits my dear id like it fine if you found another home that means the front door is open pack your things rent a moving van and git and as for marriage let me hit you with a few choice facts you arent ready for marriage you are incompetent a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men 
 i was trying to build her up not tear her down 
 jj i swear to you on my mothers life i wont do it if you gave me your column i wouldnt do a thing like that 
 sidney i told you 
 the man in jail is always for freedom 
 jj its one thing to wear your dog collarbut when it gets to be a nooseid rather have my freedom 
 why give her real proof you nearly ruined her with her first husband and you were right jj but she almost followed him out the window what do you want a chronic invalid 
 she knows now 
 why do something that would drive them right back into each others arms not to mention that this time susie would know who shot the arrow 
 how does it matter whos sister the main thing they are through and 
 are you listening 
 sidney i know human nature susie lied to me she will see that boy again 
 but not for anything i did today 
 what are you so chipper about if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes youd look like a graveyard 
 wild take a look at them and see whos wild 
 dont go wild sidney 
 lets forget cats and dogs and other pseudoliterary remarks i will just lay it on the line what about that big rumpus in my office today you were there frank where according to st dallas jj was responsible for the elwell smear 
 calculated risk only we happen to know jj that you like me im your star pupil i reflect back to you your own talent 
 full of beans aint you but you know that you will stand or fall by what you are doing now 
 a pocket fulla firecrackers looking for a match its a new wrinkle to tell the truth i never thought id make a killing on some guys integrity 
 what does that mean integrity 
 integrity acute like indigestion 
 whats this boy got that susie likes 
 presumably yours thats according to st dallas 
 and whos feet is she on now 
 sure he steams her up wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz 
 well hes got her in a tizzy i will tell you that 
 no thats the point he wont accept your favor the manager yes but not the boy 
 but its too late i got him back the job 
 i like that too look jj we can wrap this up in one neat bundle addressed to the dumps to oblivion we are going great but please play it my way i cased this kid know his ins and outshes fulla juice and vinegar just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze do little sidney a favor squeeze you know jj the porcupine bit needles 
 cant hurt i had to get him back his job 
 cant hurt 
 i think you loused this up but good if i can trust my eyes and i think i can susie knows all about your dirty work 
 with a pocket fulla firecrackers good 
 i got that boy coming over here whats so funny 
 sure you can if you want to and i know you will want to by the way whats your beef against little sidney 
 im not sure i can reach him in time 
 no i wont 
 susie i like this new attitude of yours you are growing up and i like it i dont like it when you are limp and dependent when you are odd and wayward this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world because dont forget dear you wont always have me with you will you 
 i read your column every day 
 you are picking up my lingo hon 
 yes with your prestige it only takes a minute ten cents worth of american tel and tel 
 he means that much to you 
 get steve back his jobplease 
 how 
 jj you said you want to help me prove it 
 well what have i got alimony to a pair of tramps they are of no concern to me its you who count but dont get me wrong i dont intend to let you break your neck again 
 then maybe you can tell me if hes as solid as you say why does he rap me every chance he gets 
 i know steve no 
 you mean they have been fired already on the basis of this crude smear 
 jj i want you to get them back their job steve and the quintet 
 tonight before you go to bed the cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river 
 when 
 uh huh 
 what you promised do it dont finagle around its later than you think 
 i will do it jj dont get me wrong in for a penny in for a pound i will see it through but stop beating me around the head let me make a living 
 ha my right hand hasnt seen my left hand for thirty years 
 correct me if im wrong we because when im out on this very slippery limb for you you have to know whats involved 
 not we sidney you 
 no lemme finish i dont like this job that boy is dumb only on matinee days otherwise hes got a head and susan like you said shes growing up two heads what i mean we got a slippery dangerous problem here 
 are you finished 
 awright that brings us up to five weeks ago sidney i got a nasty little problem here did i say no im frank to admit it dont jell as fast as we like but all of a sudden i cant get you on the phone no more why and why as of this date am i frozen out of the column

 why not break it up yourself you could do it in two minutes flat 
 im a schoolboy teach me teach me

 spahishthat must show he likes spigs too 
 the day that i cant get along without press agents handouts i will close up shop lock stock and barrel and move to alaska 
 i didnt say that jj 
 yes with your clients names attached thats the only reason those poor slobs pay you to see their names in my column all over the world now as i make it out you are doing me a favor 
 you print them dont you 
 what some cheap gruesome gags 
 you just had a good example of it a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna

 but what 
 but 
 it isnt i have just seen the early edition 
 no an arm he said i told him you were sure the item would be in mr hunseckers column in tomorrows 
 he wants me to break a leg 
 thats the third time hes called today 
 why dont we hear what susie has to say 
 give him creditthe boys gall is gorgeous 
 dont you think its about time you shut yours who are you to tell a man like frank dangelo to shut up 
 frank you dont listen jj just told you to shut your mouth 
 well i will tell you what excuse me for breathing will ya how do you like it he comes to my office and 
 you are talking very fast 
 according to you yeah dallas your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty i dont like you comma but neither do i go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the reds also since we are talking repulsive jj wont like this for two cents dont give me that look dallas jj believes in fair play and secondly this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication your her boyfriend 
 it is a favor isnt it 
 dallas ask your own manager hes standing here like a pained wolfhound hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife so how do you get him doing jj a favor 
 only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear you or hunsecker or both 
 thats your idea of logic i tell the judge i didnt murder the man the judge says why not you 
 why not you 
 why me 
 frank thinks i shouldnt have come here 
 its a habit with me so now im briefed so what 
 begging your pardon i havent been down the bowery in years

 but you did it for greed sidney and thats pathetic 
 i didnt do anything 
 i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love 
 i know that bit you are a girl you need a man to give you strength so what do you pick such weak sisters for dont you know yet that you fight fire with fire not with tear drops 
 im not a man sidney im 
 yeah like me i dont choke on my own gall i fight back let them choke not me

 come on now chickie why dont you go to bed 
 im sorry about steve not myself im even sorry for my brother to be so lonely without one real friend in the world to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because shes his only real family 
 listen get a good nights sleep tomorrows another day feeling sorry for yourself wont help 
 but i dont need an uncle sidney 
 its not my nature susie but i will talk to you like an uncle 
 why should he put on an act your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do 
 i hope that jj really likes steve that it isnt an act 
 chickie i will have to laugh at that an attractive girl like you 
 its given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself not just because im my brothers sister 
 frankly yes to my surprise he thinks hes very gifted those boys will go a big mile he thinks 
 do you think jj likes steve 
 who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops like a trained poodle 
 where do you come off to make a remark like that 
 well for one thing he thinks jj is some kind of monster 
 yes but why 
 we stick in each others craw 
 not to me sometimes the world feels like a cage then someone comes along and opens the doorand its never monday night again i wish you and steve could like each other 
 feels like a monday night dont it 
 i wasnt looking for a brawl i came to bring him a present wanna bite to eat 
 you are touchy sidney dont be so touchy

 i told your brother i couldnt be his accomplice i cant be yours either susie and encourage him to go on pulverizing you i know what type hes my old man all over again 
 but please steve please one step at a time i was born only yesterday 
 no im saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother 
 but i dont care about that now he knew what he was doing today he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage if i would bend to every whim of his like sidney i couldnt do that susie 
 steve i 
 susie i was there for our sake too but what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa by the way i think your brother was completely responsible for the smears 
 i just didnt think that i could antagonize him steve for our sake i mean 
 but you didnt do much about it susie you walked out and there i wassoloand not too good at that 
 no ones ever stood up to my brother the way you did 
 well maybe i was wrong too but theres no doubt susie that we have to face some serious things 
 stevewhat you tried to do todayyou tried to take me up on a high mountaini couldnt go all the wayi failed you will you forgive me have i lost you steve have i 
 would you buy me a cup of coffee in there 
 why did you call me

 im sorry honey its just that im thiiis close 
 i know you told me its a neuralnet processor it thinks and learns like we do its superconducting at room temperature other computer are pocket calculators by comparison but why is that so goddamn important miles i really need to know cause i feel like im going crazy here sometimes 
 baby this thing is going to blow em all away its a neuralnet process 
 oh i cant honey im on a roll here 
 miles its sunday you promised to take the kids to raging waters today 
 i cant 
 you need a break you will see it clear when you come back

 you going to work all day 
 no we are going all the way you got that dyson 
 we should abort 
 i was scary stuff radically advanced it was shattered didnt work but it gave us ideas it took us in new directions things we would never have thought of all this work is based on it 
 those lying motherfuckers 
 they told us not to ask where they got it i thought japan hell i dont know i didnt want to know 
 they have it in a vault at cyberdyne its gotta be from the other one like you 
 what chip 
 do you know about the chip

 i dont care theres gotta be another way havent you learned anything havent you figured out why you cant kill people 
 killing dyson might actually prevent the war 
 i dont care we have gotta stop her 
 the tN has the same files that i do it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dysons house 
 drive faster 
 this is tactically dangerous 
 yeah gotta be miles dyson shes gonna blow him away 
 dyson 
 i guess yeah oh shit 
 she intends to change the future somehow 
 no fate no fate but what we make my father told her this i mean i made him memorize it up in the future as a message to her never mind okay the whole thing goes the future is not set there is no fate but what we make for ourselves 
 no problemo 
 alriight my man 
 no 
 uhunh no its different its when theres nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway you get it 
 pain causes it 
 you mean people i dont know we just cry you know when it hurts

 no i have to stay functional until my mission is complete then it doesnt matter 
 you dont feel any emotion about it one way or the other 
 no 
 not even of dying 
 yeah i thought youd like this place 
 excellent 
 it is in your nature to destroy yourselves 
 we are not gonna make it are we people i mean 
 yeah smile you know people smile right watch 
 smile 
 and thats another thing you could lighten up a bit yourself this severe routine is getting old smile once in a while 
 no problemo 
 thats great see you are getting it 
 chill out dickwad 
 yeah or later dickwad or if someone gets upset you say chill out like that or you can do combinations 
 hasta la vista baby 
 it someone comes off to you with an attitude you say eat me if you wanna shine them on its hasta la vista baby 
 no no no you gotta listen to the way people talk see you dont say like affirmative or some shit like that you say no problemo 
 affirmative 
 a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell 
 how long do you live i mean last 
 i sense injuries the data could be called pain 
 does it hurt 
 cool 
 everything 
 just say i swear i wont kill anyone 
 what 
 swear 
 right 
 now remember you are not gonna kill anyone right 
 you just cant okay trust me on this 
 why 
 whattaya mean why cause you cant 
 why 
 listen to me very carefully okay you are not a terminator any more alright you got that you cant just go around killing people 
 of course im a terminator 
 jesus you were gonna kill that guy 
 prove it stand on one foot 
 that is one of my mission parameters 
 you have to do what i say 
 you told me to 
 oww whyd you do that 
 yeah well fuck you shes a priority to me 
 negative she is not a mission priority 
 terminated shit why didnt you tell me we gotta right now 
 typically the subject being copied is terminated 
 oh great and what happens to her 
 negative the tN s highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her 
 we spent a lot of time in nicaragua places like that for a while she was with this crazy exgreen beret guy running guns then there were some other guys shed shack up with anybody she could learn from so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader then she gets busted and its like sorry kid your moms a psycho didnt you know its like everything id been brought up to believe was just madeup fantasy right i hated her for that but everything she said was true we gotta get her out of there 
 it cant form complex machines guns and explosives have chemicals moving parts it doesnt work that way but it can form solid metal shapes 
 well why doesnt become a bomb or something to get me 
 no only an object of equal size 
 like it could disguise itself as anything a pack of cigarettes 
 anything it samples by physical contact 
 i need a minute here okay you are telling me it can imitate anything it touches 
 max 
 im right here im fine whats the dogs name 
 i would 
 you sure 
 negative the tN will definitely try to reacquire you there 
 can i stop by my house 
 we have to leave the city immediately and avoid the authorities 
 where we going 
 you are targeted for termination the tN will not stop until it complete its mission ever 
 radical 
 liquid metal 
 what does that mean 
 not like me a tN advanced prototype a mimetic polyalloy 
 so this other guy hes a terminator too right like you 
 you did thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here in this time 
 yeah who sent you 
 my mission is to protect you 
 this in intense get a grip john okay uh you are not here to kill me i figured that part out for myself so whats the deal 
 im a cybernetic organism living tissue over a metal endoskeleton 
 holy shit you are really real i mean whoah you are uh like a machine underneath right but sort of alive outside 
 no way 
 yes cyberdyne systems model N 
 now dont take this the wrong way but you are a terminator right 
 yeah shes a total loser cmon lets check out the N eleven whatya say 
 no shit 
 actually no shes a complete psycho thats why shes up at pescedero she tries to blow up a computer factory but she got shot and arrested 
 so shes pretty cool huh 
 whered you learn all this stuff 
 easy money 
 gimme that phillips right there 
 your foster parents are kinda dicks right 
 shoot 
 john get out of the way 
 ready 
 ready to rock

 i got it piece of cake 
 mom mom we need to be more constructive here i dont see this as a genderrelated issue shes still tense we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening right 
 yeah right how were you supposed to know fucking men all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your fucking ideas and your weapons did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man colt browning smith thompson kalashnikov all men men built the hydrogen bomb not women men like you thought it up you are so creative you dont know what its like to really create something to create a life to feel it growing inside you all you know how to create is death you fucking bastards 
 i know mom i know 
 i love you john i always have 
 its okay it will by okay we will figure it out 
 uh huh 
 i couldnt oh god you came here to stop me 
 mom you okay 
 i need to know how skynet get built whos responsible 
 yeah drag huh 
 look mom if im supposed to ever be this great leader you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while cause if you wont nobody else will 
 i dont trust it these things are hard to kill john believe me i know we may never have this opportunity again 
 but its the only proof we have to the future about the war and all that 
 we are better off by ourselves 
 alright it we need it 
 it john not him it 
 no dont kill him 
 out of the way john 
 theres not much time left in the world sarah 
 kyle dont go 
 remember the message the future is not set there is not fate but what we make for ourselves

 theres N bones in the human body motherfucker thats one now dont move 
 you broke my arm 
 you see sarah heres the problem i know how smart you are and i think you are just telling me what i want to hear i dont think you really believe who you have been telling me today 
 so what do you think doctor i have shown a lot of improvement havent i 
 i see so you dont believe anymore that the company covered it up 
 if i had there would have been some evidence they would have found something at the factory 
 but you have told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press 
 i see lets go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines now you think they dont exist 
 you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months well its been six months and i was looking forward to seeing my son 
 and what it that 
 it has helped me a lot to have a goal something to look forward to 
 yes 
 are you afraid 
 no there is another chip 
 its finally over 
 take your kids go to a hotel right now dont pack lets go 
 is it safe for them here 
 can you get us in there past security 
 i must be destroyed 
 son of a bitch i knew it 
 the cpu from the first terminator 
 i want to know everything what he looks like where he lives everything 
 i have detailed files 
 jesus how much do you know about dyson 
 because skynet knows the russian counterstrike will remove its enemies here 
 why attack russia 
 yes it launches its icbms against their targets in russia 
 and skynet fights back 
 basically the skynet funding bill is passed the system goes online august N th N human decisions are removed from strategic defense skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate it becomes selfaware at N am eastern time august N in a panic they try to pull the plug 
 uh huh great then those fat fucks in washington figure what the hell let a computer run the whole show right 
 in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers becoming fully unmanned afterward the fly with a perfect operational record 
 then what 
 in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor 
 why him 
 the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation 
 no 
 doesnt want you thinking too much huh 
 my cpu is a neuralnet processor a learning computer but skynet presets the switch to readonly when we are sent out alone 
 correct 
 i will bet makes you a more efficient killer right 
 so do you 
 you look like handmade shit 
 unknown 
 can it be destroyed 
 ballistic penetration shocks it but only for a few seconds 
 this tN what happens when you shoot it 
 you think you are alive and safe but you are already dead everybody you him everybody you are all fucking dead 
 relax now sarah 
 on august N th N its going to feel pretty fucking real to you too anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day get it 
 im sure it feels very real to you 
 its not just a dream its real you moron i know the date is happens 
 please continue 
 its like a giant strobe light burning right through my eyes but somehow i can still see look you know the dreams the same every night why do i have to 
 our duty is to help furtwngler with his defence thats why i want you to look at this these are part of the transcripts of the trial at nuremberg we cant get them translated fast enough but i guess you understand german right 
 major arnold believes he has a moral duty too 
 you represent the united states now we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just 
 i dont know 
 on furtwngler 
 on all what 
 where do you stand on all this 
 and this only one of these letters major i have lots of them 
 please remember that dr furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help he never turned anyone away after he heard me play i am a violinist he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden he helped countless people in similar ways 
 i dont know but you and i already know that he has saved lives 
 when he met hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him was he pleased 
 when he made his decision he couldnt have known everything especially not the way people like you do who have returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement because you are blameless you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness but you have no idea how people lived here 
 yesterday i read that furtwngler was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in N toscanini suggested it had he accepted he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america 
 but i promised your mother 
 dont see me to my door theres no need 
 i dont know 
 what does he mean too correct 
 right so this is going to be very formal too now lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares 
 and talking is talking well i think we better get on 
 eating is eating and 
 and no elbows on the table 
 respect your elders and your betters 
 oh and dont wave your hands about 
 thats right i was raised very strictly so dont speak before you are spoken to 
 thats because you had a proper upbringing 
 what is it with you david where are your feelings wheres your hatred your disgust wheres your fucking outrage david 
 major show me someone who hasnt made an antisemitic remark and i will show you the gates of paradise 
 a human being oh good im relieved i thought you were going to say you were a music lover this man this great artist has made antisemitic remarks like you wouldnt believe i got letters 
 yes im a jew but i like to think first im a human being 
 david i dont understand a thing about you you are a jew are you a jew 
 major he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect 
 with more what more what 
 when you question him again could you treat him with more respect 
 yeah 
 can i ask you a favour major 
 my manner why dont you go downstairs get a cup of coffee and calm down whats the matter emmi whats going on with you whats wrong 
 your manner 
 what 
 but it still doesnt make them saints they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night dont they they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me well just like me cant they 
 major thats not a good argument if dr furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these these privileges he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is thats true of any leading artist in any country in the world 
 not so counsellor that secretary of yours she wasnt just your secretary she procured women for you didnt she as many and as often as you wanted 
 and totally irrelevant 
 you bet 
 major this is deeply offensive and repugnant 
 isnt it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductors baton isnt that true 
 david what are you counsel for the defence now did you hear the question 
 major i dont see how this line of questioning could 
 you see wilhelm im talking about ordinary everyday reasons which is why i want to discuss your private life how many illegitimate children do you have 
 why not show dr furtwngler the evidence it may refresh his memory 
 yes david 
 yes what was the orchestras reaction when they asked you to play for hitlers birthday 
 you have a question for helmuth david 
 its a bet you are the witness emmi 
 five minutes 
 okay better question the next witness i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes 
 thats big of him 
 major richards said hed call to let us know 
 jeez and you think the british will share it with their allies 
 i dont know but the british are excited about it i know that the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich 
 whats that mean 
 the british occupy the building where this guy hinkel ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems they have they have discovered his secret archive 
 so what is it 
 yes 
 david need to ask you something you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive 
 they are trying to sort out some of the works of art the nazis stole from occupied territories who really owns what thats colonel dymshitz on the far side 
 what the hell are they doing 
 dimshits 
 colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you 
 so what does the russki want 
 i guess its possible 
 you think a whole orchestra what a hundred and forty or so guys could be orchestrated 
 dont this is like a criminal investigation david musicians morticians doctors lawyers butchers clerks they are all the same 
 some 
 i guess you admire musicians 
 was born here in leipzig i escaped in N my parents they sent me to my uncle in philadelphia they were to follow but they delayed and 
 where you from david 
 you call me sir again and i will make you listen to beethoven 
 i guess so sir 
 sounds a lot of run so they sent the big guns to check up on me we recruiting children now 
 david david wills im your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee sir 
 im steve whats your name 
 im very sorry 
 for chrissakes i hate that shit cut it out 
 lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold sir 
 then you are going to kill me 
 im gonna get that fucking bandleader colonel no deal no fucking deal 
 duty i am sorry duty duty fucking duty trouble is you americans want everybody to live like you we liberated berlin major steve not you our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture 
 i have a duty 
 let furtwngler go please 
 no can do 
 im sorry museum not i said orchestra sorry believe me help me steve you say you answer for someone from high up i too have orders from high up very high up we want furtwngler i will give you in return the whole orchestra four five conductors i need him steve 
 what museum 
 and suddenly steve suddenly you notice that they like you they honour you suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world for example 
 there are good party members who help and there are dirty nonparty members who inform on you of course they gave him privileges 
 this is what im saying he must have had party contacts 
 in a dictatorship art belongs to the party if you want to be a conductor you have to have an orchestra and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises 
 yeah yeah art and politics yeah yeah i heard all about that 
 dont talk about things you know nothing about he was in a dictatorship 
 but what before that turns rotten what if they surround the space with barbed wire colonel 
 anyway major why should he leave his country his mother tongue his family his history his past his future just because now suddenly there is a dictatorship why 
 colonel he had no sisters no brothers only a lot of love affairs 
 thats why he didnt get the hell out of here when he had the chance i put that to him he couldnt answer why didnt he go and direct in america like that italian toscanini 
 a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone 
 we are dealing with degenerates here 
 furtwnglers in a different category 
 i was in vienna i had with me an austrian chauffeur max his name was he spent time in the camps we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage scavenging for rotting food butt ends anything i said to think a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city a million of em and now look at em and max said oh not these people major these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics you get the point colonel the point is they are all full of shit 
 i have had two meetings with him hes a great musician maybe the greatest conductor in the world his brahms beethoven schubert unequalled 
 not yet 
 so major tell me have you questioned dr furtwngler 
 colonel pleasure 
 hello major my name is dymshitz im glad to see you 
 i would like to go now please 
 if he had no idea why did the jews need saving this is the question emmi to all germans why did the jews need saving in this country why if people had no idea 
 but he had no idea a lot of people had no idea i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested 
 emmi stop i want to show you something let me show you something and then if you want to leave you can leave please please his friends they did this and he gave them birthday concerts 
 i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that just like you questioned him 
 whats not right 
 i cant do this its not right 
 what is this emmi 
 im sorry but i have to leave i will find other work you will have to get someone else thats all 
 put it on ready to play and i will tell you when to play it 
 of course 
 do you know where the adagio begins 
 bruckners seventh major 
 shut the door emmi sit down emmi we are going to keep him waiting too 
 major major hes here 
 come in emmi this is your office too emmi this is lieutenant david wills 
 im sorry 
 you tell him nothing emmi if he calls again you say you know nothing we are gonna keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses and god help me with beethoven 
 the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since N together with their questionnaires major what am i to tell dr furtwngler 
 whats in those files 
 no ours was damaged 
 im kidding emmi what about a record player you have that too 
 but he only wrote nine major 
 mines the eleventh 
 oh yes major i have recordings of all his symphonies i kept them safe during the bombing my favourite is the seventh symphony 
 think you can get me any of that 
 there have been messages for you a lieutenant david wills called from the allied kommandatura cultural affairs office in wiesbaden i dont know who he is 
 steve 
 and your father was executed 
 yes she suffered longer she was in ravensbruck 
 your mother too 
 my father was one of the officers in the plot against hitler they arrested the plotters and their families 
 says here because of your father whats that mean 
 three months 
 okay lets see how long were you in the camp for 
 yes 
 you do shorthand and typing 
 yes 
 you live here in berlin 
 look around you see the country you served look at people who had real courage who took risks who risked their lives like emmis father 
 i love my country i believe in music what was i to do 
 have you ever smelled burning flesh i smelt it four miles away four miles away i smelt it have you ever seen the gas chambers the crematoria have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses you talk to me about culture art and music you putting that in the scales wilhelm you setting culture art and music against the millions put to death by your pals they had orchestras in the camps they played beethoven wagner the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families i dont understand the germans relationship with music what do you need music for your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated yes i blame you for not getting hanged i blame you for your cowardice you strutted and swaggered you fucking piece of shit kingpin in a shithouse you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows and i say to you lies 
 i will tell you then the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself listen to it they listen did they pick little ks recording did they pick some other conductor no they picked you and why because you represented them so beautifully when the devil died they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march you were everything to them 
 how can i know such a thing 
 whos conducting 
 bruckners seventh the adagio 
 okay so what is it 
 of course i know what that is 
 do you know what that is 
 speaking to party members i used their language of course i did everyone did 
 i believe that but just answer the question dont give me explanations 
 those attitudes do not exist in me 
 everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews but i have things here you said and wrote listen to this the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international and what about this jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples lacking roots you deny you said these things 
 no thats your problem wilhelm you understand nothing we will call you go 
 i dont understand what you mean 
 okay wilhelm go home now go home and think about these past twelve years 
 but you see what im getting at you get a gorgeous house you are highly paid what are you gonna do stay or leave one voice comes back at me stay 
 i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter 
 no im not going to stop it hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter 
 stop this please stop this now 
 you like the women dont you wilhelm 
 i said i have illegitimate children i dont know how many 
 what 
 i have illegitimate children 
 of course there was a conspiracy against me a campaign even abroad 
 well im just beginning to develop my theme isnt that what you call it in classical music developing your theme okay so they played on your insecurity thats human understandable but there is one guy who doesnt like little k as much as he likes you yeah the number one man your old pal adolf he thinks you are the greatest and when he says i want wilhelm for my birthday boy they better go out get wilhelm so josef calls and threatens you with little k and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna i will give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin thats the trick they played they got you by the balls and they squeezed hard why did you stay why did you play for them why were you the flagcarrier for their regime jealousy 
 this is absolute nonsense 
 come on admit it k worried you didnt he he always worried you in N hes thirtyfour years old you are already fiftysix and goebbels and goering keep saying to you if you dont do it little k will never mind art and politics and symbols and airyfairy bullshit about liberty humanity and justice because i dont care how great you are its the oldest story in the book the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck the real reason you didnt leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that once you were out of the way youd be supplanted by the miracle kid the partys boy twice over flashy talented little k 
 yes thats what happened 
 i will tell you why you remember we talked about you playing for hitlers birthday and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first that you were tricked 
 please stop playing these games with me why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding 
 now that young conductor whats his name that miracle kid you know who i mean von karajan but you called him something else cmon what did you call von karajan 
 im sorry 
 you have really no idea i will tell you what happened he died in stalingrad 
 i have no idea 
 and what happened to von der nul 
 he said dont mind him his job is to criticise your job is to conduct 
 and what did he say 
 well once he said hed read what this man wrote about me 
 you sure you didnt call one of your close buddies and say god in heaven did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me the greatest conductor on earth i want him out the way he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music send him to stalingrad isnt that what you did you dont like criticism do you wilhelm you surely didnt like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels 
 thats an outrageous lie 
 isnt it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy von karajan called him a goddamn miracle said he was a better conductor than you then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no ones heard from him since 
 yes i know who he is 
 how longs this going to go on wilhelm i say von der null you say von der null i say von der null you say von der null we could go on all day you know who von der null is dont you edwin von der nuell music critic 
 von der null 
 yes von der null 
 von der null 
 tell me about von der null 
 no because i had only one intention my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics 
 no 
 have no idea what ordinary people thought 
 you know something you should have written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity what do you imagine people thought the berlin philharmonics taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance so art and politics are now entirely separate is that what you believed ordinary people thought 
 we never never officially represented the regime when we played abroad we always performed as a private ensemble as i think i already told you i was a freelance conductor 
 art and politics yeah art and politics lets look at that you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich played in countries the nazis had conquered are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from N on wasnt a commercial for adolf and all he stood for 
 then you are wrong 
 well i tried you got to admit i tried i thought i might just trap you there wilhelm but david here was too quick for me smart move david smart move no i dont have the telegram but i know it exists and i want you to know wilhelm we are going to keep looking for it because i believe you sent it 
 you wont find it because no such telegram exists 
 i dont have to think carefully this is utterly ridiculous 
 think carefully wilhelm maybe not in your own name but as privy councillor or vicepresident 
 i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings 
 the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal adolf hider 
 i have no idea what you are talking about 
 happy birthday dear adolf love wilhelm or words to that effect that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying okay adolf you win you are the number one man have a swell party 
 what telegram 
 and when did you first learn that when you sent the telegram was that the surrender signal the waving of the white flag 
 i believe art and politics should be separate but that they werent kept separate i learned to my cost 
 gee thats a thing of beauty honest to god a real thing of beauty im going to try to remember that liberty humanity and justice beautiful but you used the word naive are you now saying you think you were wrong that art and politics cant be separated 
 maintain liberty humanity and justice 
 and what was that 
 when i last saw you i was unprepared i did not know what to expect in these past weeks i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes you have to understand who i am and what i am i am a musician and i believe in music i am an artist and i believe in art art in general and music in particular has for me mystical powers which nurture mans spiritual needs i must confess however to being extremely naive i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics my entire life was devoted to music because and this is very important because i thought that i could through music do something practical 
 go ahead be my guest 
 i wish to say something 
 if its too hot open your tie 
 dont talk to me like i was a second violinist go back into the waiting room miss straube will come and get you when i am ready to see you 
 it is now nine oclock precisely i do not intend to be kept waiting again 
 oh boy you are gonna love this take your time with this now those files contain the details of every working artist in this country those files are gonna tell us who joined the party who informed and who was helpful 
 he told me to be careful as one of goebbels men was watching me he read a report on me everything i said was quoted word by word 
 what did goering say 
 goering because hinkel was working for goebbels 
 who warned you 
 i was warned 
 how 
 i wasnt told i just knew it 
 who 
 certainly not but i knew he had informers everywhere even in my orchestra there was someone 
 yup thats him thats the guy you know what else the little creep did he kept files close on N files and you know whats in those files 
 yes a despicable human being he was in the ministry of culture his job was to get rid of jews in the arts 
 i have got to hand it to the british david you know what those guys are decent tell me herr dr furtwngler do you know hans hinkel 
 i have had enough of this im leaving 
 steve arnold 
 see david he cant answer the question i will ask it again wilhelm and dont give me any more airyfairy intellectual bullshit 
 they were jews they had to leave they were right to leave i could not leave my country in her deepest misery after all i am a german i i stayed in my homeland is that my sin in your eyes 
 i have a list of names here people in your profession who got out in N bruno walter otto klemperer arnold schoenberg max reinhardt 
 if you are going to bully me like this major you had better do your homework you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are 
 you were real close to all of them to adolf to hermann to joseph to baldur and now albert so lets hear the truth lets come clean what was your party number 
 it would be truer to say i think that a lot of people in high places knew me 
 you sure knew a lot of people in high places 
 during an enforced hourlong interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin albert speer the minister of armaments said to me you look very tired dr furtwngler you should go abroad for a while i knew exactly what he meant 
 so how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you 
 you didnt complain about the racial policies just about the musical standards is that right 
 i believe it was because of another letter id written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies 
 why were they going to arrest you 
 it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me 
 i dont know he wasnt my case why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended 
 then why is it please that another conductor who was actually a member of the party who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait 
 tough tough 
 i need to work i need to make my living i live off the generosity of friends 
 your guess is as good as mine 
 when will my case be heard by the tribunal 
 sure 
 may i ask a question 
 or maybe you called goebbels or goering you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them 
 let me me help you then you picked up the phone and made a call hello adolf wilhelm speaking listen old pal theres a jewboy musician i want you to help he needs a permit to get to paris 
 i may have as as i said i simply dont remember 
 did you call someone you knew 
 i dont remember in detail there were so many 
 i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape how did you do that 
 its the truth 
 i dont buy that 
 i made no deal 
 could i have a glass of water please please fraulein 
 how come 
 that that was a different matter i i was tricked 
 that sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies wilhelm and what about april N N the eve of hitlers fifty third birthday the big celebration you conducted for hitler didnt you was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other 
 i did not conduct at at the rally i conducted on the evening before the rally 
 then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies 
 well there was a constant battle between goering and goebbels as to which of them would control german culture i was simply a pawn anyway i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as musical director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra in N 
 goebbels and goering were sure heaping honours on you one makes you a privy councillor the other makes you vicepresident of the chamber of music and you werent even a member of the party how do you explain that 
 i dont think dr goebbels sent me a telegram i was simply told in a letter i believe i dont remember exactly 
 what about vicepresident of the chamber of music you used that title didnt you but then i suppose you had no choice there either because i suppose dr goebbels just sent you a telegram saying dear mr vicepresident 
 i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse after the dreadful events of november N the violent attacks on the jews i stopped using the title 
 could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor how did that happen to a nonparty member 
 that is correct 
 what they do in austria doesnt interest me one little bit okay i have your questionnaire here gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwngler born berlin january N orchestral conductor and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party 
 i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria 
 i want you to understand why you are here you are automatically banned from public life under control council directive no N we are here to look into your case before you appear in front of the tribunal for artists of the denazification commission you understand that 
 his private life 
 and ask him about his private life 
 yes yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name he he refers to him as k 
 the miracle kid 
 also a conductor very brilliant young von der null called him the miracle von karajan furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army the same thing happened to another critic true or not its not such a bad idea critics give you bad reviews you have them sent to the russian front but if you really want to get furtwngler ask him about herbert von karajan 
 whos he 
 edwin von der null music critic he gave furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan 
 never heard of him who is he 
 theres a rumour i dont know if its true or not but ask him about von der null 
 no but thats why we hated him we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didnt have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us he didnt have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad he got everything from them everything he was filthier than any of us party members 
 but i need documentary proof you know of anything like that 
 sonofagun we will find the corporal and we will find the telegram 
 yes a corporal us army a jew he said hed seen the telegram in the chancellery 
 one of my people 
 one of your people told me 
 he did 
 furtwngler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday 
 yeah 
 i have remembered something else 
 of course you too like everyone else in this goddamn country 
 the only thing i know is hes an antisemite 
 fuck that helmuth you want to discuss symbols here this guy was a front man he was the piper but he played their tune you get my philosophical meaning im not interested in small fish im after moby dick come on helmuth hard facts 
 major we are discussing a man of genius i dont want 
 i can give you freedom of movement freedom to work freedom helmuth but i need something in return 
 you dont know what its like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified you dont know that 
 oh i see he made you cooperate and now are you a communist again 
 i was a member of the communist party i was a communist thats what hinkel had over me he knew everything he held that over me thats how he made me cooperate 
 was a member of speak up 
 onezerofourninethreethree one or dyou mind if i just call you one 
 what 
 all in the cause of humanity helmuth or should i call you one zerofourninethreethreeone 
 you usually dont work on sunday major 
 so you wanted to see me 
 great catch kid the boy runs off 
 dont worry helmuth it will be our secret 
 exactly replaces the baton gives steve the case 
 and i see what you mean you nearly poked my eyes out 
 do it helmuth 
 not here major there are people if anybody should see please please major 
 yeah show me i want to see you do it pretend im adolf you are the maestro and you have the baton in your right hand but you give me the salute just the same 
 show you 
 show me 
 how could i forget 
 yes you remember 
 the one he kept in his right hand yes you remember 
 its dr furtwnglers baton which i stole 
 love em helmuth i give up what are you holding in your hand 
 guess what i am holding in my hand you like guessing games 
 helmuth 
 major 
 how could i know whats in the archive 
 do you know whats in this archive 
 i hear the british have his his archive files records 
 hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture how could i know such a man i 
 you seem to understand the question now how about answering it 
 do i know hans hinkel 
 thats what i asked 
 do i know hans hinkel 
 do you know hans hinkel 
 oh we didnt play for his birthday we played the evening before it was the N th of april not the N th 
 excuse me did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience 
 i will ask the questions helmuth 
 is it true you are going to interview dr furtwngler today 
 me never never 
 good and according to your questionnaire helmuth you never joined the nazi party 
 it means i wasnt good enough to be a first violinist 
 helmuth alfred rode second violinist since N whats it mean second violinist 
 when you got to the crescendo 
 i dont know what you mean major 
 was looking at furtwngler like that 
 yes 
 you ever seen adolf hitlers eyes when he was making a speech i have seen em on films 
 politics and art must be kept separate i will remember that but let me see if you can help me with something i just dont understand id really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him whats his secret 
 yes dr furtwngler was absolutely clear about this politics and art must be kept separate 
 oh the evening before i see 
 he was forced to do that but he refused to give the nazi salute in front of hitler he kept his baton in his hand you cant salute with a baton in your hand 
 but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday 
 goebbels yes josef goebbels said theres not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr furtwngler has not intervened no no one could have been less of a nazi than dr furtwngler 
 well hes more than just a bandleader steve hes a great conductor a gifted artist but we believe that he sold himself to the devil your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the nazi party dont be impressed by him i want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war find wilhelm furtwngler guilty he represents everything that was rotten in germany 
 like this bandleader 
 well they say here that when you went on a case you stayed on it now we cant take every nazi in this country to trial although i would like to its an impossibility so we are going for the big boys in industry education law culture 
 they said i was dogged 
 conscientious determined dogged 
 right claims assessor 
 you were in insurance before the war 
 jeez and i never heard of him 
 hes as big as toscanini maybe even bigger in this neck of the woods hes probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one 
 sure 
 do you know who arturo toscanini is 
 nope 
 so you never heard of him 
 do you really think it was brave didnt he bow to him and shake his hand 
 it was beethovens ninth 
 brave to celebrate hitlers birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute bravo 
 yes thats true but he refused to give the nazi salute he kept his baton in his right hand in hitlers presence that was a brave act 
 he also conducted for hitler didnt he 
 it was hermann goering i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor no questions asked although dr furtwngler stood up to him and to dr goebbels 
 then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor 
 dr furtwngler is a great musician he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape 
 hey hey slow up fraulein straube has to take down what you say 
 no i was never a nazi i have no interest in politics im a musician 
 absolutely not 
 i have your questionnaire here it says you were never a member of the nazi party

 defense network computer new powerful hooked into everything trusted to run it all they say it got smarta new order of intelli gence then it saw all people as a threat not just the ones on the other side decided out fate in a microsecondextermination 
 i dont understand 
 everythingis gone just gone there were survivors here there nobody knew who started it it was the machines 
 tell me just start at the beginning 
 theres so much 
 listen understand that terminator is out there it cant be reasoned with it cant be bargained withit doesnt feel pity of remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop ever until you are dead 
 just let me go 
 right 
 and you are from the future too 
 one possible future four your point of view i dont know the tech stuff 
 so its from the future is that right 
 no not yet not for about forty years 
 hey im not stupid yknow they cant build anything like that yet 
 pay attention the N series had rubber skin we spotted them easy but these are new they look human sweat bad breath everything very hard to spot i had to wait til he moved on you before i could zero him 
 look reese i know you want to help but

 cant nobody goes home nobody else comes through its just him and me 
 then how are you supposed to get back 
 it had no choice the defensive grid was smashed wed taken the mainframes wed won taking out connor then would make no difference skynet had to wipe out his entire exist ence we captured the lab complex found thewhat ever it was calledthe timedisplacement equipment the terminator had already gone through they sent two of us to intercept then zeroed the whole place sumner didnt make it 
 yes 
 i see and thiscomputer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy kill ing him in effect before he is even conceived a sort of retroactive abortion

 that depends on your definition of ghosts im going to check on her and then im going to stay awake 
 you dont really believe its haunted do you believe in ghosts 
 we are fucked we are in a haunted house and we cant get out until the morning 
 the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection like he says its about one thing a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia and thatd be a legitimate study but i think that we have been subjected to an academic bait and switch hes really looking at something else 
 mister very talky would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you 
 no 
 so could you is this some fucked up idea of art putting someone elses name to a painting 
 you could have 
 i didnt do it 
 he must have left didnt like the looks of the place or something 
 well this lot is full 
 luke 
 hey i heard screaming 
 and why didnt marrow tell us doesnt he trust women that fuck 
 he said that hugh crain hugh crain was a monster he said that he was a brutal horrible man he told me that crain drove his workers to early deaths crain had children chained to the looms in his mill and listen to this his beautiful rene killed herself 
 nah you are going crazy with doubt all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes and its worse than a nightmare 
 the rest of you may hate your insomnia but i find it the best time of the day for me im alone nobodys talking to me but myself my mind is racing with ideas and i can think 
 this is the last chapter please please give me clearance its for science 
 i have a bad feeling about what you are doing 
 she needed a job malcolm and shes smart and she helps me 
 i i just cant 
 no 
 does she know thats why you are using her 
 no but she does and thats all that matters 
 you dont believe in the paranormal 
 and after she was thrown out she needed a job 
 why are you working with her mary lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a phd in psychic studies 
 mary i will meet you outside 
 are you working with her 
 but if the group knows its being studied as a group you contaminate the results the deception is minor 
 not the way you have constructed your group its just not ethical 
 no malcolm individual performance is only part of it i know why baseball players choke for no reason i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert and need to to give a great performance but what i want to know is how fear works in a group 
 and that will be a good place to end this study 
 malcolm this is essential work im doing just think what my research can do for education elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports where loud noise is random this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read 
 come on malcolm its only seven ohms its nothing its like a joy buzzer and its not about the pain its about the interference with concentration 
 its still an electric shock 
 nothing if you leave right now theres a war going on all around us dont get in the way please 
 what will happen to us nell 
 no 
 come on 
 my mother used to hum this to me like her mother hummed it to her and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her 
 no 
 then who called me 
 nell the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here 
 but you told me to look in the paper you told me id be perfect 
 nell you will come here now 
 the children want me they are calling me they need me 
 because thats where he burned them up the child laborers from his mills because thats where their bones are he killed hundreds he took them here and he killed them their bones are in the fireplace 
 why would we want to do that nell 
 its not real crain hes not real 
 i hadnt done a study of how group fear affects individual performance mass hysteria is like a story nell a communal story someone starts it then we all add a little more to it and then for some reason no one knows how we start believing it this story shapes what we see and hear we interpret everything through it make it fit the story i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house you have added to it thats what this experiment has all been about thats what it was about the experiments over im pulling the plug this is my fault 
 and they are all locked together in here and he wont let go of them 
 nell please nell take a deep breath 
 i dont know a lullaby i guess my mother used to hum it to me and her mother before that and so on hugh crain would you care to dance 
 what is that tune 
 it doesnt matter even if they are tormenting me someone wants me what i do with this is up to me i can be a victim or i can be a volunteer and i want to be the volunteer 
 i dont know 
 why 
 someone is playing with you 
 sure 
 you will never see it again mr dudleys taking care of it im sorry nell can i show you something youd like to see 
 welcome home 
 it was 
 it was a stupid thing to do 
 i dont know 
 lets say it wasnt you who did it 
 i wish i were i wish i had done it then i could confess and youd be at peace that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved i wish you had an enemy so i could beat him up 
 are you coming to confess 
 no you are not something moved you you saw something 
 im sorry im messing up the study 
 hmm 
 i got more scared 
 and then what happened 
 yes 
 like she smelled it too 
 i looked at theo she had a look on her face 
 what happened after you smelled it 
 i wasnt thinking about my mothers bathroom 
 so smell is smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories and a memory can trigger a smell 
 in the bathroom in my mothers room the toilet was next to an old wooden table it smelled like that wood 
 all right 
 it was very specific 
 what did it smell like 
 that smell oh god 
 nell whats wrong 
 for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic pardon me excuse me sorry sorry 
 sorry 
 how do you feel about lukes suggestion that it was just the old plumbing water hammer something like that 
 theo i think you have asked us that three times doctor marrow whats going on 
 the cold sensation who felt it first 
 but theres a sad catch to the story 
 all the carvings 
 yes because someone was always keeping me awake ever since i was little that was my job i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long and she woke up all the time and after she died well its been a few months but i still i still wake up its a habit i know we have only known each other a couple of hours but im really glad to be with people who let me talk about this im really happy to be here with you 
 you wrote that you had trouble sleeping 
 well we are glad to have you 
 im really honored to be part of this study jim 
 nell good enough and im jim 
 you can call me nell dr marrow 
 eleanor how was the drive 
 there were no children rene died and then hugh crain built all of this and then he died his heart was broken 
 what happened 
 yes its perfect isnt it 
 this is where we are going 
 that thats hill house 
 whats this whats this this picture 
 good 
 heres how they are organized groups of five very different personalities scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for and they all score high on the insomnia charts 
 because its my phone yes mrs dudley just leave the boxes inside thank you see you soon thank you 
 howd i know it was for you 
 yes this is doctor marrow 
 test it 
 you hear the vibrations in the wire theres a magnetic pulse in the wires you feel it i could test it 
 you are going to publish hes going to perish and why did you hire me for this 
 what 
 you know what hes really upset about 
 but the experiment was a failure 
 im a scientist i just conducted an experiment now i have to write it up 
 im not going back to new york city im going to find an apartment with a little flower garden where you can just see the ocean and at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the sound of the harbor what about you 
 nell what do we do 
 oh god we cant get out 
 no if hes lost somewhere in the house he will have to stay lost until tomorrow until the night is over what we have to do now is be together with nell 
 hes wandering around the house and nell heard him she thought it was ghosts lets go look for him again 
 i will take her with me to the university tomorrow i cant believe i read the test wrong i didnt see anything that looked like she was suicidal 
 she needs help 
 yes but i promised i wouldnt let her alone the whole night 
 is she asleep 
 how could you do this to people 
 your fear of him was real thats all the ghost anyone needs 
 its okay we are all here 
 get a blanket 
 mary came with me 
 maybe they are marys 
 good morning theo luke 
 well this is a cozy breakfast 
 every day basically we will be hanging out together like we have so far this evening 
 when do we take the tests 
 no but nells been here longer than i have 
 have either of you seen david watts 
 cant say havent been here that long well its labor day gotta get to work 
 why 
 she was unhappy 
 yes 
 whyd she kill herself 
 why 
 rene crain up there rope ships hawser hard to tie dont know how she got it 
 who 
 thats where she hanged herself 
 mrs dudley will be waiting for you 
 is there something about the house 
 thats a good question what is it about fences sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable why would that be 
 why do you need a chain like that 
 im with dr marrows group im supposed to check in with mrs dudley up at the house is she here 
 yeah im mister dudley the caretaker what are you doing here 
 are you mister dudley the caretaker 
 me no what are you doing here 
 oh you scared me 
 what do you want 
 no one will come any nearer than that 
 no one could no one lives any nearer than town 
 no one could no one lives any nearer than town no one will come any nearer than that in the night in the dark 
 why would we 
 its a job i keep bankers hours i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six you can serve yourselves breakfast is ready at nine i dont wait on people i dont stay after dinner not after it begins to get dark i leave before dark comes we live in town nine miles so there wont be anyone around if you need help we couldnt even hear you in the night 
 well i have never lived with beauty you must love working here 
 i have seen em lot to dust 
 they are so beautiful arent they 
 so far 
 mrs dudley 
 its make the soup or answer the door cant do both 
 then lets go get you one 
 oh theo you know i dont have an apartment 
 just had to be sure 
 whatd you come back for babe 
 come on why are we waiting 
 they are all in here all the ones he killed they are just children we have to help them 
 i do 
 i dont think i want any 
 im going to stay with you until you fall asleep and then im going to get some brandy 
 but the painting 
 nell it makes sense it all makes sense you and i we were scaring each other working each other up 
 this is real im not making it up theo you saw it you were there the banging and last night you you all saw the painting 
 carolyn showed me where she hid him hid him with all the ones he killed 
 nell what happened 
 because i dont want to ruin things because home is where the heart is 
 then who is come on nell deep down if you really thought it wasnt jim why wouldnt you be leaving right this second why wouldnt you be afraid really afraid 
 what do you think 
 marrow said the same thing as last night he says that he checked with mrs dudley and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney he says that he thinks that the flue was open and with the windstorm he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current 
 okay 
 i think so 
 are you sure 
 im trying have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid itd ruin things 
 my place isnt like yours nell it doesnt have a view of sea it doesnt have a view of anything whats interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls living with me my boundaries arent very well defined nell do you know what i mean 
 i dont know you know 
 you want to move to new york you want to move in with me 
 i have a loft 
 i will take that as a compliment in the city what kind of place do you live in 
 me too although i learned one thing about you that you dont know about yourself you can be a pretty decent bitch 
 im sorry i was mad at you theo 
 red what else 
 well 
 i have never had a pedicure before 
 just think about one thing right now what color 
 i dont know what to think anymore 
 well it wasnt me mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that hes in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and you said the good doctor was with you 
 before he painted your name over mister crain 
 theres hundreds of them this must be a record of the children who died at the mills like luke said 
 thats so sad 
 i dont know you have been alone for a long time maybe you want attention maybe he did it 
 why 
 maybe you did it yourself 
 theo did you 
 no its getting worse 
 is it over 
 maybe he never came in if hed come in he would have left his bags at the door right or maybe he got here early and went for a walk and fell maybe hes outside 
 david 
 david david watts can you hear us david daviiiiid 
 david 
 whats his first name 
 watts 
 two sets i dont know maybe they are not even his 
 how could he have left without his keys 
 i guess oh your hair it looks good

 you too happy tossing and turning 
 good night theo

 i dont have anyone but i do have a little apartment of my own it has a little flower garden you can just see the ocean at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the buoys in the harbor 
 a blank canvas i could paint your portrait directly on you or maybe not so you husbands boyfriends girlfriends where do you live

 no 
 we cant find two of our guys 
 we think 
 we think someone is here

 whats the matter 
 all your life that happened while i swam the length of my pool 
 i have lived in la all my life i have never done this drive 
 im a gracious host

 you demand to be served a fork fetishist 
 i dont like doityourself cuisine buffets salad bars 
 like you 
 im not into finger foods too fussy

 anything but japanese 
 what kind of food 
 as soon as you get dressed 
 its an observation like im hungry when are we eating 
 its not a compliment 
 its not a knock 
 im so glad we are having this chat 
 no you are not specific enough to be a person you are more like a vibe 
 im not 
 well you are certainly not a person 
 am i a thing 
 im loyal to things that make me happy 
 not for you clearly 
 is that a problem 
 is it possible that you are too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty 
 then what good is he 
 gordon hes been with me for years hes not as tough as he looks 
 i want to know why you need that scary guy in your house 
 is there anything in the world that you want or need 
 could be worse he could have named you reticulum 
 i used to hate it now i like it 
 adhara i told your father if you are looking for a name you cant go wrong with a constellation 
 thats why im letting you take care of this im the one with appearances to maintain but who gives a shit about you not even god 
 fuck you mr whateveryourname is this is a lifestyle i embrace 
 see a successful man like me has limitations i lose touch at a street level so i have to depend on a smart boy like you whos closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am 
 this is unfucking professional 
 i will point you in the right direction but you will have to take it to the end zone hes a hitandrun gunman i figure hes not cruising the polo lounge

 heavier than that now but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story 
 i mean gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds 
 what did you tell them

 this towns been chewing my flesh since what we now refer to as the early N s christ my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me 
 and how did you get it 
 you think terry gave me access to her things probably sold her clothes 
 how did you come to have my address found it did you among her things 
 shed never called me like that before she sounded more pissed off angry than upset or afraid but she never turned up i called the house but only got the answer machine when they found her shed been going the wrong way not the direction shed have gone if shed been coming to see me or coming straight to see me who knows maybe she just wanted to drive 
 she told you all about my details but not about his lovely 
 jenny was supposed to come to my place that night she called me asked if she could come over she and terry had been having some trouble lately i dont know about what on this occasion it reached some sort of crisis point 
 theres the phone you want his number 
 i will bloody well ask him 
 on what what makes you so certain 
 depends don it 
 terrys never going to give you satisfaction not the type 
 what do you think 
 you dont believe it was a car accident 
 whatd you want me to do stay at home twiddlin me thumbs doing sweet fa 
 you fuckin guys and your dicks 
 have you ever known me not to be 
 are you serious 
 why not 
 so whats the deal you and terry valentine at twenty paces is that what this is about 
 when he wants someone run down you are willing to do it for him 
 this and that yknow ways and means 
 in what capacity are you employed by this mr lindgren 
 anyhow hes always saying to me dave never run yourself down son cause there will always be plenty of people willing to do it for you 
 right 
 well not to say mr lindgren is dishonest exactly 
 i thought you said you never did an honest days work in your life 
 various enterprises style of thing 
 i bet 
 based in london but with international concerns 
 i see 
 proprietor of a london firm of longstanding 
 what line is he in 
 my employer 
 whos mr lindgren 
 mr lindgren 
 your employer 
 now you shouldnt run yourself down my employer mr lindgren 
 lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing like me but on a grander scale of failure 
 well i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me some sort of pop music producer wasnt it 
 do you even know who terry valentine is 
 eight hours difference between here and london would have been what ten in the morning my time i was just coming out on the yard now i was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then bit of fresh air stretch me legs well stretch the day out really thats what you wanna do and i will tell ya i couldnt open the paper could not pry the pages apart it was like they was glued together thats how weak my hands went thought i was having heart attack only i knew i wasnt bloke come up to me he says dave he says you have gone all white i said fuck me i have been in prison half my life what dya expect but he was dead on cause i could feel the blood drain right out of me head and i knew something had happened to jen 
 thats what was estimated 
 i already knew knew beforehand when was it supposed to have happened two oclock in the morning eddie said 
 where you get your bank statements 
 something like that yeah 
 whats that like a po box 
 nah accommodation address 
 the address jenny gave me that wasnt a prison was it 
 nah we split up when jenny was six her second husband done a runner after she got sick they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital we were always mates me and jennys mum i like to think they are together again now yknow heavenly choir 
 were you still married at the time to jennys mother i mean 
 well dont suppose she did really most of her life on her own after her mum died aunts and uncles for a time and then the bright lights beckoned 
 i gave him yours said here you want to write i think this is a relative i guess i thought i was being true to jenny who told me she didnt have a father before proceeding of course to tell me why 
 he give me your address 
 i should really give him a call hes a character isnt he well not to you i meant to us squares in the outside world 
 yeah saw eddie yeah me and him are muckers 
 and you have seen eddie rama 
 well i reckoned saturday night if you were goin out youd probably have to come home first 
 i might have been away for the weekend 
 no i had some other matters to attend to you know getting a car sorted 
 you havent been lurking outside my building all day 
 yesterday afternoon 
 when did you get in 
 she was happy here however the two of you might have parted dont think she wasnt 
 footloose and fancy free 
 she was twentyone when she came to me straight from leaving you 
 in jenny course not how could i be course i wasnt 
 you werent disappointed in her then 
 learnin ow to speak proper central school of speech and drama its no doddle gettin in there yknow at seventeen they offered her a place at rada n all only shed have had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on was jenny she could talk posh without any training when she was kneehigh to a grasshopper show up the old man you know 
 modelling 
 yeah well she started all that in london 
 when im not honing my craft in episodic television i do doubleduty as a voice coach not that her accent would have hobbled her progress not with that look 
 howd you manage that then 
 she never told anyone else about the convict strain or is it stain no i was privileged i was someone who helped jenny efface her past 
 she never told eddie though 
 disappointed 
 not ashamed 
 ashamed 
 not embarrassed 
 i cant believe jenny told you all that about me she was always so embarrassed 
 im sorry i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went it must have been the bars 
 when you have lost as many years as i have love puts things in perspective know what i mean 
 now whos being sarcastic 
 oh it just ended then 
 three seasons they found thats the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail i was wife number three the ingenue 
 said it went on for donkeys years 
 if it played in england somebody owes me money who told you that eddie 
 werent you on a television series 
 sarcastic moi maybe i will mellow when my ship comes in its expected any day now im all packed and ready to go 
 here are you always this sarky 
 sounds like beverly hills 
 no i went in for more improving pastimes philosophy classes language courses european history all that lark did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in peoples houses than there were people in peoples houses 
 try calling me again 
 here arent you gonna let me in 
 well that kind of security cant be bought must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you 
 hardly buried earning interest love earning interest in an offshore account tidy little premium per annum that 
 and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out from the wembley staduim job wasnt it pink floyd concert receipts jenny would have been fourteen at the time 
 sewing mailbags me never did an honest days work in my life dear wasnt about to start when i was in stir not with all that leisure time on my hands 
 in any case i dont suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel 
 it was the bars then 
 i heard you were whats that adorable phrase at her majestys pleasure 
 what was that then 
 thats not what i heard 
 i was skint didnt have no money to get here 
 its been a while 
 how dyou mean 
 been busy have you 
 sort a few things out 
 no why did you come here 
 wanted to talk to you didnt i 
 why did you come here 
 she used to pinch em off me funny that one thing she never tried to get me to stop 
 not her brand 
 perhaps it was the smoke 
 you look alike 
 had a feeling it was you 
 what am i doing 
 and that is 
 in which case i will just do what i usually do 
 as you prefer squire as you prefer 
 but if you are mad at him too and hes mad at you that must make us pals 
 oh yeah right the deal 
 of the deal man 
 all of what 
 hed already grabbed more than his allotted cut didnt think hed be so bold as to take all of it 
 no i can reassure you on that point valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you 
 because that wasnt anything to do with me and suspicion has been cast in my direction didnt make any sense choosing those shitheads over me cutting me out of the deal then screwing them over too 
 eh 
 it was you downtown 
 nothing financial strictly personal i can see how all this importexport malarkey might give rise to confusion where im concerned a foreigner showing up unexpectedly like 
 so whats your beef pal 
 yeah shouldnt wonder must have done 
 that dude who works for valentine hes the one sent those guys after you you know that 
 good job your lot showed up when they did or it would have been me for the high jump 
 yeah i guess you are 
 your guess is as good as mine mate im here on another matter entirely 
 but i cant be sure i dont even know who he is hes too insulated too many layers around him 
 i can well believe it im sure he has done son hes about as straight as a dogs hind leg 
 well i will tell you i believe this valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money 
 look mush you are the guvnor here i can see that im on your manor now right so theres no need to get out of your pram im johnnycomelately to all this whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine its got nothing to do with me i dont wanna know 
 theres one thing i dont understand the thing i dont understand is every motherfucking thing you are saying 
 he had urgent business in the north 
 where is he now 
 hes always been very forwardthinking he invested wisely 
 so you wouldnt have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money 
 my client is an entrepreneur i am his lawyer not his business manager 
 your client have a deal in long beach how about downtown theres some folks there oh wait they are all dead any of this ring a bell 
 deals my client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment youd have to be more specific 
 a statement i wouldnt mind getting a statement you see my client the united states government would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client 
 my client has already given a statement regarding yesterdays events 
 valentine had himself a party i hear 
 yeah cheers mate 
 yeah i really admire the guy well good to meet you 
 right chain of respect thats good that 
 what i like about ian he believes in a chain of command but not a chain of respect you understand what im saying 
 no kidding 
 turned that place completely around N degrees 
 yeah 
 thats too bad ians got a good thing going over there 
 unless im not who i think i am 
 you sure 
 sorry wasnt me 
 i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london 
 ian 
 dont you work with ian 
 yeah 
 the ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders 
 but first i gotta give these lads a talking to these geezers what sent me up the river in a manner of speaking 
 could do yeah 
 sounds like you need a rest 
 i had to didnt i nothing else for it then just when id finished my nine years my contract wallop i had to bugger off to the states 
 but you stuck it out anyway all that time 
 well time off for good behavior you know i shouldnt have even been there it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place i got lumbered with the job they were responsible for i dont mind pulling me own cart but not someone elses know what i mean 
 nine years is that legal 
 out on a oil rig in the north sea nine years 
 where else 
 been away a lot 
 no rest for the wicked 
 yeah another little matter needs attending to soon as i return 
 you will be looking forward to getting back then 
 you are a reluctant traveller then 
 i would have preferred staying home me 
 i can never decide what i like better leaving home or coming back 
 yeah thats right 
 while they are all fucking each other over couple of parties like us could move right in 
 how we gonna get that lucky 
 drugs cash both if we are lucky 
 whats in it 
 i dont know who that english guy is some kind of courier or something maybe a seller maybe a buyer but mr avery wanted him those jigs wanted him and i betcha theres a briefcase somewhere 
 i dont get it 
 he aint wrong listen i know this asshole who did just go to work for him fulltime and this dickheads parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast thats the type of individual gets hired someone who will shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job 
 well we blew it didnt we he aint wrong 
 like hed never hire me for real not weektoweek i dont have the credentials he thinks im just a sociopath someone he can turn to when he needs plausible denial 
 like what 
 you bet 
 you do 
 i happen to know more about mr whatever hisnameis than he thinks i know about him and his operation 
 what 
 somethings on 
 there is 
 theres more than a measly few grand in this 
 we coulda used the other twoandahalf grand

 any happier than any other asshole in life 
 what dyou mean any happier 
 and i said so what you think shes any happier 
 i dunno i just said shes nice lookin

 that dont mean nothin 
 avery said she was tight with his daughter 
 maybe she doesnt even know the english guy

 i dont know 
 two blacks and a mexican in a car whos driving 
 why dont they have tv shows about people whose daily lives youd be interested in watching yknow like skinny little weakling or big fat guy sick old man family of losers wouldnt that be good

 kinda makes you wonder why more people dont put a bullet through their fuckin skulls doesnt it

 ann 
 a spacecraft i saw the creatures they led big dave onto the craft he never told anyone what they did outside of his report of course he told me no one else 
 ann 
 at night there were lightswe both saw them we never told anyone outside of our official report

 but it doesnt matter really im not interested in playing music professionally 
 im sure theres a dozen teachers better than this clown more qualified goddamn phony 
 it doesnt matter mr crane 
 look im no expert but 
 but more or less 
 he didnt say that 
 i stank didnt i 
 just see him as a favor to me 
 geez mr crane 
 i know you havent look just go meet him as a favor to me i talked to this guy hope i pronounced his name right he sounded very busy but hes not a bad egg he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are he agreed to see you this saturday he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough his words 
 geez mr crane i dont know i hadnt really thought about a career or stuff 
 i have to do it i cant stand by and watch more things go down the drain you are young you dont understand 
 oh mr crane 
 you have got talent anyone could see that and hes the best if he thinks a student has talent he will take em on for next to nothing you are a cinch to be accepted i could cover the cost of the lessons like i said its pretty modest 
 boy 
 thats swell however the music if you want to pursue it well the lessons from mrs swan they will only take you so far theres this guy in san francisco i have made inquiries everybody says hes the best trained lots of people who have gone on to have big concert careers symphony orchestras the works his name is jacques carcanogues im not sure im pronouncing it right anyway hes a frenchman 
 well sure i guess pop says so too i work pretty hard at school

 doesnt become a matter of public record unless theres foul play however i dont believe im prohibited from telling you this i guess im not obliged to tell you either i dont exactly know but if i were the man id want to be told 
 you sure you dont want something stiffer 
 just coffee 
 rye 
 nah dont say anything im alright 
 doris 
 i knew wed pay for it 
 honey 
 my books used to be perfect anyone could open them up make sense of the whole goddamn store 
 you dont have to tell me anything 
 should i should i tell you why 
 dont tell em anything we are getting you freddy riedenschneider 
 i know all about that but i dont know how much to tell them 
 you dont have to tell them anything we are getting you a lawyer 
 i helped him cook the books ed i did do that 
 you dont have to 
 i dont know what happened to big dave i know some of it irregularities in my books they said can i explain it 
 what happened to you 
 i dont know whats going on i 
 how are you 
 honey 
 its just a goddamn bowl of cherries im sure 
 honey 
 life is so goddamn wonderful you almost wont believe it 
 congratulations gina 
 gratulations gina its so goddamn wonderful 
 i didnt say a word 
 whats so damn strange about that 
 mm 
 that means i dont run nirdlingers 
 so 
 money problems hes thinking about canceling the annex 
 ahh 
 hows that 
 dave 
 who 
 what a knucklehead 
 oh dont be a grump 
 nah go ahead im not big on parties 
 come on get ready its important 
 yeah right 
 me us the party at nirdlingersi told you last week for the christmas push 
 where you going 
 mm 
 honey 
 my first instinct was no no the whole idea was nuts but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop nose against the exit afraid to try turning the knob what if i could get the money 
 well he got his mistrial but the well had run dry there was nothing left to mortgage riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway 
 and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women 
 he told them to look at melook at me close that the closer they looked the less sense it would all make that i wasnt the kind of guy to kill a guy that i was the barber for christs sake 
 who among us is in a position to say 
 how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the da made me out to be how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadnt had a chance to trot out for doris 
 a puny player on the great worlds stage 
 i gotta hand it to him he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes he talked about how id lost my place in the universe 
 i tried to tell him the whole story but riedenschneider stopped me he said the story made his head hurt and anyway he didnt see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave 
 not guilty your honor 
 who who i dont know who but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time hes spent persecuting this woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoes past then we might know who but we cant know what really happened because of fritz or werner or whatever the hell his name is and because me prosecutor is also a lazy fatassed sonofabitch who decided its easier to victimize your wife because its easier not to look because the more you look the less you know but the beauty of it is we dont gotta know we just gotta show that goddamnit they dont know reasonable doubt science the atom you explain it to me go ahead try 
 so who who actually 
 did big dave mention that it was something about his war service i dont know i wasnt there you will have to tell us maybe he specified maybe he didnt im not putting words in your mouth the point is that this liar this cynical manipulator this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who did serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores and who made a fool out of this entire town turns to you to help him out of his jam fatassed sonofabitch 
 and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego you asked for blackmail let me give you blackmail mr halefellowwellmet about to open his own business here has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years probably including half the people sitting on that jury well it finally caught up with himthese dopes it always does someone threatened to spill it somebody knew his dirty little secret just like your wife says they called they demanded money 
 yeah 
 look chum this is a guy from what i understand told everybody he was a war hero right island hopping practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth

 manual overrides arent working im getting nothing lieutenant 
 no 
 there are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder claimed they saw a monster they are pretty determined to tell you their story you want to see them 
 it better be good 
 uh vince sorry this wont wait 
 no one broke into this room sir someone broke out that lock was torn off from the inside 
 why not 
 dont know if it will do any good mr cuthbert 
 the claws are sharp i must have cut myself better move these crates to the secure storage area where they will be safe 
 looks like the curse is still at work 
 doesnt look like it we are damned lucky this statue is priceless 
 anything missin 
 someone broke into this room 
 im sorry sir you okay 
 beauregard you scared me half to death 
 i have to help pendergast kawakita and jonathan stay with me the rest of you can go with cuthbert 
 my office is on the third floor theres a walkin safe and a portable phone we can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help 
 get his gun and his walkie talkie jonathan move 
 sweet jesus 
 he will be back relax we are in good shape your security is air tight there have been no more incidents nothing suspicious theres no reason to call off the opening now 
 pendergast may be in trouble dont you understand he still hasnt come back its been over three hours 
 you havent got the authority only pendergast can pull the plug 
 i will go down and speak to him 
 its too late now guests are arriving the mayors car is pulling up 
 im telling you somethings wrong i still havent heard from pendergast i think you should call it off 
 i appreciate that 
 we all love the museum i come here myself with my kids we are trying to work with you 
 i understand but mr cuthbert we have got bigger problems depending on what we find today we may have to shut you down 
 i dont want to scare people 
 yes 
 do they have to wear uniforms 
 if the party goes forward and thats a big if i have arranged for a large police presence 
 we have been operating in the red for years that was the whole idea behind the superstition exhibit it was designed to pull people in we have spent every penny we have on advance publicity betting everything on the openings success if we postpone at the last minute no i dont want to think about that 
 i have read about the museums financial troubles 
 if you like them they are for sale another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block 
 i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesis forum sketches 
 eight to the right look i found it 
 fifteen whats next 
 oh jesus 
 to the left twice then five no sorry i think its fifteen its been a while 
 for chrissake i will do it whats the combination 
 just a minute im shaking take the gun 
 hurry up 
 that thing wont come after us right its going for bigger game the group blundering around in the basement poor fools 
 lets go 
 batterys dead shit 
 calm down i found it 
 forget it 
 i will do it just let me find my portable phone 
 whats the combination 
 behind you 
 wheres the walkin safe 
 i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring 
 its a little late you son of a bitch theres a friggin monster loose in here get the fbi the fire department find metal cutters cut through and bring a cannon the damn thing is huge 
 i made it outside i will coordinate the rescue efforts from here help is on the way just sit tight 
 where the hell are you 
 dagosta ippolito come in 
 like hell 
 ippolito get back here 
 you said the system couldnt fail 
 i told you they seal off all the cells they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure 
 what doors 
 the whole system is shutting down we have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall 
 you dont know much about computers lieutenant there are safeguards built in we have backup systems with redundancies theres no way these computers can fail 
 that would leave one exit for hundreds of people youd be violating every fire regulation on the books we will guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells one more question i see a big hole if this entire thing is run by computer what happens if the power fails 
 in every exhibition room the museums divided into five cells the reception and exhibit are in cell five we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four then seal the perimeter with our fire doors 
 thats great if you are stopping a burglar not our goal here are there motion detectors 
 its fool proof basically i designed this whole thing myself every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip if anythings moved so much as an inch we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft 
 the cops are nonnegotiable ippolito why dont you just tell me how this space station works 
 this huge police presence tonight isnt necessary lieutenant you will just scare people off i can handle the security behind scenes with this system its state of the art 
 the subbasement huh great idea 
 nice to see you lieutenant 
 everybody get behind me 
 go out the north exit theres a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases run 
 i smell it its here 
 i have been down there it links up to the old sewer system i can guide you out 
 the subbasement 
 vince theres no way we can get to you with the fire doors down theres an entrance to the sub basement in the hall off the north side exit 
 this doors locked try shooting the hinges off 
 pendergast help its right behind us 
 we havent got time you have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight 
 i think i should come with you 
 apparently its huge 
 how big is the subbasement 
 you have been holding out on me pendergast you have a suspect capable of this 
 this isnt an animal vince i have been on this case four months remember i have learned a few things 
 i dont like animals never have dog bit me when i was little after that i gave up on pets animals are irrational give me a psychotic killer any day if theres one thing that makes me queasy its being part of a food chain my first case as a rookie two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo it was late august over ninety the polar bear was inside his cave kids didnt know he was in there all they saw was the pool they got to swimming and splashing the noise woke up the bear by the time i arrived both little boys were in pieces the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot i can still hear the mother screaming 
 correct 
 saliva test you mean you think someone ate part of the brain 
 if you dont mind a suggestion you might try a saliva test 
 what happened to them 
 oh 
 no i think what we have got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon who wants us to believe hes a monster 
 you think what we have got here is a monster as big as a house that smells like hamburger 
 i believed them 
 they heard the victims name and wove him into their story nice touch 
 how do you explain the part about beauregard 
 i have got to admit that was a damn sight better than the dog ate my homework 
 unfortunately no 
 you are kidding 
 if you dont mind this could be important 
 no theres more there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat 
 so the method of death is the only connection 
 yes thats my case now its yours all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way decapitated brains extracted limbs torn to shreds it looked like the work of a large animal but there was no sign of an animal on board 
 who didnt big news out of brazil wasnt it 
 did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago twelve bodies on board 
 call me vince 
 lieutenant 
 then you wont like this one its a piece of shit 
 not at all i enjoy the smell of a good cigar 
 i drink after hours of course on duty i smoke do you mind 
 in this violent world i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things 
 cant really focus on birds at the moment pendergast im tryin to keep my breakfast down 
 an original roger tory peterson of a redbreasted merganser amazing i have a copy of this in my office at home 
 night watchman who found the body sweet old man been tossing his cookies for over an hour not a likely suspect 
 whose footprints 
 careful that mess on the ground is brains 
 wheres the head 
 we need light in here stat 
 mind if i have a look 
 whats left of it 
 the body 
 not at all i think we may be working on the same case if so i could use your help 
 vince dagosta am i out 
 special agent pendergast fbi 
 who are you the undertaker 
 the virus itself might have positive applications they will keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made greg isnt joining us 
 shouldnt a drug that powerful be destroyed 
 this on top of the scratches isnt it proof 
 pardon my french but bull shit 
 did you hear that my god he says that mbwun is real 
 may i see that 
 look its some kind of letter 
 im one of the few who know every inch it now that john is gone 
 this place is a maze 
 id say we are in its home 
 dear god where are we lieutenant 
 i dont know i thought dr whittlesley died in south america 
 whats that doing here 
 dr john whittlesley 
 what does it say 
 all right everybody hold up 
 whats that 
 not so loud 
 i believe in you a hundred percent vince but thats the second time we have been at that intersection 
 oh shit 
 all right kawakita cover the rear 
 you are asking me i dont even know how to load this thing 
 how much ammo do we have to make a stand 
 i know 
 its still back there 
 theres a dead body in the exhibit people are panicking trampling each other trying to get out 
 what happened 
 its important please you have to come pendergast too shes found out something 
 got my hands full here 
 dr green has to see you 
 what is it 
 lieutenant its me 
 yes two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision 
 the thalamus and the hypothalamus perhaps 
 curious theres something missing 
 right the entire brain appears to have been extracted may i see it please 
 someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa 
 what are we talking about here 
 lovely bouquet after our last case vince took me out for a draft beer as i recall we split the check 
 i hope you liked it 
 oh yes who could forget afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte 
 we have met the hacksaw murders N 
 look whos here margo 
 dr frock 
 remember it has poor eyesight it hunts with its sense of smell so for gods sake margo dont get those fibers on your clothes 
 we will 
 come back and get me 
 no dr frock you cant 
 im coming with you 
 that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes 
 we cant we have managed to get inside the one place thats safe i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements if we go outside we are risking more lives you have to accept it margo theres nothing we can do the building must be swarming with police by now it wont take long for them to get through the doors 
 none of that matters now the people upstairs need us we have to help 
 its one of the fire doors good lord margo we are trapped 
 whats that 
 dont stop now 
 dr frock did you hear that 
 i think so 
 some kind of power failure maybe its the storm do you have a flashlight 
 whats going on 
 its like ringing the dinner bell 
 and its hungry its been two days since its eaten there are five hundred people arriving right now the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell all those people in one enclosed space 
 margo what you have just described is a killing machine 
 with the intelligence of a human being the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a grizzly bear 
 so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night 
 nocturnal external hair and bony plates locomotor speed N kilometers reduced optic chiasm poor eyesight external mucoid nasal glands very keen scent morphological characteristics highly robust aggressiveness extreme 
 quadrupedal the other name for mbwun he who walks on all fours 
 all right assuming the program is accurate this is a description of the animal with that claw species unidentified genus unidentified phylum unknown male weight in excess of N kg brain capacity N centimeters that means its highly intelligent quadrupedal 
 but a virus normally codes for other viruses this ones making human and animal proteins listen to this glycotetraglycine collagenoid weinsteins tropic hormone N monoxytocin supressin hormone 
 thats not so unusual many plants carry viruses like the burls on maple trees 
 look at this an ambyloid reovirus protein that explains why the computers confused the plants infected with a virus 
 several problems with that theory for one thing this egg is intact for another according to pendergast the crates were shipped here on a boat everyone on board was killed like beauregard if the thing hatched in midocean where did it go 
 come on margo we are on the verge of something huge lets consider the possibility just the three of us alone in this room what if john was right i mean what if and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates when it got to the museum it hatched 
 lets not jump to conclusions this egg could belong to any number of reptiles dr frock 
 like the claw 
 they are eggs 
 what are they 
 margo these arent seed pods 
 you are right 
 whatever it is it must be common on the tepui john used it as packing material 
 im not sure as you know the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant 
 what is it 
 let me see the plant press 
 a blow dart seed pods a plant press pretty unimpressive stuff 
 i cant help thinking theres something that pendergast overlooked if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard it wants something thats in here 
 cuthberts counting on the exhibitions success the museum is in debt contributions and public funding have dried up admissions no longer cover overhead the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red if the superstition exhibit isnt lucrative he will have to start auctioning off some of these gems 
 that cuthbert what a piece of work someones dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit 
 everyone needs a change of scenery i have been rolling down these halls for fortyodd years thats quite enough 
 you are this museum it wont be the same without you 
 this isnt a death sentence greg has promised to teach me fly fishing i will garden i will write 
 you must 
 im not giving up 
 come on i will walk you back to the elevator 
 healing plant use among the ki tribe of bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for tibetan erotic art 
 your work is highly relevant what about your display on primitive pharmacology cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit 
 with all due respect dear thats bull you dance rings around me with your new technology you have left me in the dust 
 my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you 
 yes it is im tired and im no longer needed 
 how can you say that you know its not true 
 no margo this is one problem you cant solve you have to stay out of it the fact is i want to retire 
 let me help i can take care of everything 
 please dont humiliate me further 
 that apparently is the problem im yesterdays news who needs a curator of plant biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants monsters and dinosaurs cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm 
 we cant do without you you are one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology you are practically an institution around here 
 now margo dont overreact cuthbert has to cut costs somehow my leaving makes perfect sense this isnt exactly early retirement i have overstayed the party a bit 
 i dont believe it 
 yes bit of a shock but as cuthbert so tactfully put it the museum needs new blood and since i have been here since the mesozoic era 
 they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta 
 dr frock i was wondering what happened to the rest of whittlesleys plants 
 footsteps 
 whats that 
 hes right 
 margo this is too dangerous you always think you can solve everything this time you dont have enough information the animal might behave in unexpected ways leave her here with me dont put her in danger 
 i dont believe it 
 we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate 
 you said you had plans of the museum could we see them please 
 i dont know it was walled over no ones been down there in years 
 where is that 
 not really just the subbasement 
 are there any hidden rooms or staircases places where someone could hide 
 yes 
 you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum 
 dear louis tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we will be in the greatest danger so im sending carlos back with the crates you always believed in me louis even in the darkest days so it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded we have made an incredible find i enclose a representation of mbwun note the exaggerated claws the reptilian attributes the hints of bipedalia its beyond belief but this statue is accurate i know because i have seen the beast 
 read it out loud 
 its from john those two arrows were his insignia its addressed to louis moriarty a patron who financed his expeditions 
 i wouldnt be so sure 
 this means there must be an animal loose in the museum 
 and failed these doors are solid steel 
 something tried to get into this room 
 yes john made quite a study of the whole museum he had a copy of my original plans 
 do you mean dr whittlesley 
 they fill seven floors we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world just to give you an idea there are more than three million insects specimens not to mention amphibians reptiles birds anthropological artifacts meteorites minerals and gems only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display 
 how many storage areas are there 
 happy to be useful its rare enough these days according to security beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area N 
 thank you for taking the time to help us with this dr frock 
 fourth floor west wing but stay with your class 
 way cool then you know where the dinosaurs are 
 evolutionary biologist i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years 
 nothing im in third grade whats a revolutionary what cha ma callit 
 im an evolutionary biologist what do you do 
 what do you do 
 yes i do 
 you work here 
 you are color blind 
 they were yellow 
 they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizards 
 it had a long tongue teeth this big and yellow eyes 
 like this 
 and it snuffled the ground like a dog 
 well almost depends which house it smelled like old hamburger and it made this weird noise 
 not that big 
 big as a house 
 we were just lost okay and we went down this curvy staircase at the bottom was a big shadow 
 i dont know but i think its bad 
 what is it 
 quiet 
 dont be a wuss come on 
 i dont want to go this way 
 chicken this is a great short cut 
 we are not supposed to go back there 
 lets ditch and find them ourselves 
 shes never going to take us to see the dinosaurs that lady said they were on the fourth floor 
 this room sucks 
 keep the animal quiet 
 oh no i smell it 
 another storage room 
 jesus what is this 
 quiet 
 oh my god 
 not on the map looks like it connects with the city sewer 
 its alright i can tell by the way the dogs acting that whatever was out there is gone what is this place 
 come on lets get back to the others we cant leave them alone 
 look its hobbes hes all right 
 hes right follow me 
 theres something out there lets go get it now thats why we came down here isnt it 
 get back now 
 argo hobbes 
 holy mother what is that 
 stop 
 heel argo hobbes heel 
 shut them up 
 keep the light up i cant see 
 they have got something 
 not yet lets try the fork to the left 
 the dogs have lost the scent mr pendergast maybe we should head back 
 hard to read in this light the ink is so faded 
 okay 
 not today besides i think the director of the museum is expecting you 
 how about lunch 
 got to finish this thesis sometime 
 yes hes fine greg take care of yourself 
 is dr frock safe 
 yes whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant when the crates were put in secure storage they were out of reach the killer couldnt get them so it got the next best thing 
 eats them 
 pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victims brains 
 so what 
 this is it this is what he or it is after the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain 
 try weinsteins tropic hormone 
 N monoxytocin is a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland 
 what kind of hormones 
 these plant fibers are loaded with hormones 
 its reptilian 
 what kind of egg is it 
 theres another possibility a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage 
 lizard dna and human dna on the same strand impossible the sample must be contaminated 
 turkish gecko i believe a lizard 
 its not mammalian thats for sure i think its reptilian 
 what do you make of it margo 
 whats that 
 mbwun 
 someones been murdered not shot strangled or stabbed either torn limb from limb theres talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal 
 for once im glad you are rumor central what in the world is going on 
 im sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings but you know me telegraph telephone tell kawakita i got the definitive word from cuthberts secretary this is dr frocks last week 
 thats impossible 
 frocks been fired 
 what 
 margo you havent heard 
 i have the species identification on these teeth we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program call dr frock he wanted a demonstration 
 but at what a price 
 if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod id have my phd 
 im in town on a case dropped by to see vince and we thought wed see the new display 
 im so glad to see you whats the occasion 
 you have to do it now 
 i cant 
 he has to look here or i wont get a clear shot call him margo 
 do it quickly please aim for the eye 
 i have to shoot 
 just like john he wont listen 
 whatever that thing is we have to kill it 
 you have to listen all viruses pass on their own dna instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses this one was different it inserted a whole array of genes into john reptile genes sixty five million years old those genes remade him its not his fault 
 i dont believe it 
 that thing is john whittlesley i should have seen it before the fibers are infected with a virus you eat them and the virus alters your dna he became addicted to them in south america followed the plants back to the states he probably entered the country as a man it would have taken several months for the change to take place thats how he got from the boat to the museum 
 what 
 no dont kill him pendergast you were right its john 
 listen to me pendergast mbwuns dna is part homo sapien in primates the eye is a direct path to the brain if you get a clean shot theres only one place you can kill it shoot it in the eye 
 we are not going to make the storage room 
 its coming run 
 you smell that 
 oh god help 
 help someone 
 its deceptively simple like a bruckner symphony or a matisse 
 thats a ptarmigan feigning a broken wing the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest 
 the answers right in front of us 
 how 
 we have to try and draw it off 
 i think for the pleasure of the kill 
 for what 
 no its still hunting but not for the hormones 
 then it wont go after the others 
 i think it means its full 
 it didnt want the fibers what does that mean 
 its eyesight is worse than i thought it couldnt see us and it couldnt smell us through the glass 
 what happened 
 its scared of me 
 what is it doing 
 what are you going to do 
 hide quickly 
 no the planetarium is in the next cell this is one of the fire doors 
 is there another way around 
 vince 
 the planetarium 
 that was dagosta 
 unlock one of the other storage rooms we are going upstairs we will leave a trail back to N and try to trap the monster in here 
 youd slow us down and put margo in danger 
 we have the fibers dont you see the creature is hungry it wants the hormones in these plants it would take hundreds of human brains to supply whats in these fibers we are just a poor substitute to make it stop hunting we have to give it what it wants 
 but what can we do our guns are useless 
 but this isnt the jungle this is new york how did it get here a thing like that crossed two continents it makes no sense 
 its not supernatural mbwun is an animal part lizard part human a genetic freak of some kind like the halfgoat halfsheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam 
 i dont know how to deal with this its hellish like nothing i ever saw im not trained to deal with a monster a supernatural creature like that 
 that would fit its nocturnal quick come inside 
 no a chromium alloy tipped N caliber bullet bounced off that things skull like a spit ball i think it was bothered by my light 
 wounded 
 gone 
 you are not where is it 
 no i think im hallucinating 
 pendergast are you all right 
 we need someone to take us to the secure storage area 
 when dna is defective it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair viruses can damage dna so can radiation certain chemicals even cancer lets let the gse sort it out i have to get started this will take several hours 
 genetic damage 
 i dont know mr pendergast do me a favor get me a dna readout on that claw 
 what was it 
 all right this is hard for me im a scientist i like order and logic sometimes too much theres got to be an explanation there cant be an animal in there but i saw something 
 they are all heavily armed 
 i didnt imagine it i know what i saw are you sure there are enough men in there 
 dr green 
 all right if you are positive 
 thats not what i saw 
 behind me over there 
 where did you see it 
 its okay im all right i remember now it was an animal something large i could smell it it was hunting me i saw two green eyes in the dark 
 you were behind me running after me 
 i heard you calling and i ran after you but you kept disappearing and i couldnt keep up 
 i dont know 
 what happened 
 all right im as macho as you are perhaps 
 im not sure we should split up you take that hall and i will take this one 
 where would we find it 
 would you mind showing it to me 
 i dont know he sent back a statue thats supposed to be an exact representation but i have never seen it its in the exhibit 
 i dont think so i think we were meant to think it was mbwun did whittlesleys monster have claws 
 my god then it was an animal 
 something came up in autopsy tonight imbedded in beauregards body we found a claw 
 i dont understand 
 what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there was he desperate enough to create one 
 no im all right i wont let this affect me anymore john wouldnt get help his ego endangered the lives of others his theory came first 
 no one knows the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals 
 what happened 
 yes he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect it held that evolution wasnt always gradual or driven by natural selection the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a monster species it made no sense but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years 
 a monster 
 a legendary monster called mbwun 
 tell me about the last expedition what was he looking for 
 he was afraid of himself he tried suicide once he was ill manic depressive he had wild emotional highs and lows not a happy affliction for a scientist hed been revered in our community by the end he was a joke 
 you were afraid of him werent you 
 that was two years ago john was still in love with me he wouldnt leave me alone 
 i ran an internet search on dr whittlesley got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times i also found a record of your restraining order 
 how did you know that 
 you were going to be married 
 yes once we met at columbia john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there 
 you loved him 
 john couldnt have anything to do with a horrible thing like that he was a fine man despite his problems 
 the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten just like beauregard one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact 
 i dont understand 
 disappeared his body wasnt among the victims 
 and john 
 dr whittlesley was last seen in belem venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat that boat washed up in my district everyone on board was killed 
 you have time to talk 
 if he were alive hed have contacted me 
 maybe not 
 somehow when all this happened i knew it would come back to john is he really dead 
 no i came to talk about dr john whittlesley 
 with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal whether it was nocturnal what it ate how it hunted how big it was you arent here for a lesson in dna 
 how does it work 
 an invention of mine its a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator 
 special agent pendergast fbi forgive me i guess i was snooping what is this 
 it doesnt matter i will make other arrangements 
 you want to book the flight 
 thats right 
 i thought you were in a hurry 
 why wouldnt i

 storm musicwagner 
 what music 
 cue music 
 sweep the harbor 
 why would we 
 we are not watching the sea 
 its just a matter of time 
 what have we missed 
 im sure we will get him on this next sweep 
 he has to be on foot he has the worlds most recognizable face he cant disappear 
 all prop cars accounted for 
 we have declared a curfew everyone else is at first positions 
 he gave it back to his father 
 give me a shot from trumans ring 
 he was tidying up his garbage i was going to call you but halfway through he gave up and fell asleep 
 what happened down there 
 whats on the clockcam 
 whats to see 
 why wasnt i told any unpredictable behavior has to be reported is that the best shot we can get 
 he moved down there after meryl packed up and left 
 why is he in the basement 
 no hold back 
 close up 
 lets take another call london england you are on tru talk 
 we have learnt about life as truman has and despite the complaints of a minority its been an overwhelmingly positive experience for truman and for the viewing public 
 the hague for christofthe haguelost them hollywood california you are on tru talk 
 i have been tempted but i think its important to retain objectivity i wouldnt want to get emotionally caught up 
 you have never actually met truman yourself never thought about doing a cameoplaying a veterinarian or a priest something like that 
 we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented as the show expanded naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep truman in seahaven demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk 
 why do you feel that trumans never come close to discovering the true nature of his world 
 and its all available in the truman show catalogue operators are standing by 
 theres nothing on the show i dont use myself 
 all products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value 
 yes everything you see on the show is for sale from the actors wardrobe food products to the very homes they live in 
 no of course not and since the show runs N hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement 
 people forget it takes the population of an entire country to keep the show running 
 and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country 
 thats correct 
 who knew that a show originally meant to last one year bringing up baby would turn into a cradle to grave concept he is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation 
 in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies the casting of a show determined by an air date he was the one who arrived on cue 
 of course his eagerness to leave his mothers womb also meant he was the one selected 
 he was curious from birth premature by two weeks as if he couldnt wait to get started 
 let me demonstrate some examples 
 we should remind viewers that truman especially as a child presented a challenge for the production 
 istanbul turkey you are on with master videographer christof 
 as with our own lives the only people he cant cast are his family otherwise he has final approval able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend marlon or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player 
 of course truman has always been very much in on casting 
 certainly a nomination 
 are we talking emmies 
 lets go to some of those viewers calls 
 we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort havent you ever watched your child or your lover sleep 
 but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps 
 not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth he gives us a glimpse of ourselves 
 i prefer to think of it as a mirror 
 a window onto the human condition 
 we have become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions bored with pyrotechnics and special effects while the world he inhabits is counterfeit theres nothing fake about truman himself no scripts no cue cards its not always shakespeare but its genuine thats how he can support an entire channel 
 it has to be the reality 
 but recent events have been so dramatic it does raise the perennial question what keeps us watching this one man twentyfour hours a day eating sleeping working sitting for hours in contemplation 
 as you know ratings have never been our primary goal i imagine we will lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing trumans latest torment however im certain that our core audience will remain loyal 
 lets talk ratings truman has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few dayshow do you hope to sustain that audience now that truman appears to have reconciled himself 
 of course 
 amnesia 
 how do you intend to explain his twenty two year absence 
 that and a fat new contract 
 i understand hes hardly had a life of his own since he left the show how did you convince himwas it the opportunity to be close to truman again 
 since kirk started this whole crisis in trumans life i came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it 
 and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role i really must congratulate you on writing kirk back in a master stroke 
 a dead one at that 
 of course there hasnt been anything to compare with this the first time an intruder has been a former cast member 
 we have had our close calls in the past 
 the catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course trumans father kirk and his infiltration onto the show before we discuss that its worth reminding viewers that this isnt the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach truman 
 thank you 
 welcome 
 you never had a camera in my head 
 truman i have watched you your whole life i saw you take your first step your first word your first kiss i know you better than you know yourself you are not going to walk out that door 
 i have a map

 nothing was real 
 you are the star 
 a show then who am i 
 a show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions 
 the creator of what 
 im the creator 
 who are you 
 i cant believe he married meryl on the rebound 
 because his mother got sick very sick he couldnt leave her hes a kind boy maybe too kind 
 but why didnt he just follow her to fiji 
 shhh 
 the memory of who 
 they removed all physical trace of her but they couldnt erase the memory 
 whats he doing 
 guess i always thought theyd adopt 
 sure she would 
 you think shed go through with it 
 why not 
 its not gonna be his you idiot 
 how can they have a child

 the thing that started all of this 
 whats that 
 not the whole thing truman you were right about one thing 
 so what are you saying marlon the whole thing has been in my head 
 and the last thing id ever do is lie to you think about it truman if everybodys in on it id have to be in on it too im not in on it because there is no it 
 this is different everybody seems to be in on it 
 its a lot of world for one man you sure thats not wishful thinking you wishing youd made something more of yourself christ truman who hasnt sat on the john and had an imaginary interview on seahaven tonight who hasnt wanted to be somebody 
 i dont know what to think marlon maybe im going out of my mind but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow 
 truman its me marlon i need to talk to you 
 stay where you are 
 really 
 just between you and me marlon im going away for a while 
 thats the big guy quite a paintbrush hes got 
 yeah 
 i went all over but i never found a place like this look at that sunset truman its perfect 
 when you were hauling chickens for kaiser poultry what was the furthest you ever went off the island

 your dad 
 i think its got something to do with my dad 
 no truman if this is another one of your fantasies 
 theres no point in trying to explain it but a lot of strange things have been happening elevators that dont go anywhere people talking about me on the radio you know what i mean 
 mixed up mixed up in what 
 i think im mixed up in something 
 are you okay you look like shit 
 im onto something marlon something big 
 sorry im way behind

 sure its halogen shame it didnt hit you you could have sued you coming for a drink 
 you really think it could have dropped off an airliner 
 trust me 
 you think so 
 i figured whats the point i knew id just be taking my problems with me once the kids came along it made me look at seahaven with new eyes i realized what the hell could be better than this im telling you what you really need is someone to carry on the burbank name 
 yeah what happened 
 truman you know i did think about moving away one time 
 spare room i can start thinking about selling upand i will be gone up and away on that big steel bird im going dont you worry about that

 it was dad i swear dressed like a homeless man and you know what else was really strange a businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus 
 it doesnt sound insane truman i swear i see him ten times a weekin a hundred faces i almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last thursday 
 i feel certain my condition runs in the family cant this wait dear 
 i spend half my life out in the sun mother why would i need vitamin d

 we dont even know you 
 i think you better tell us 
 you are not supposed to talk about it who told you that 
 not supposed to talk about it 
 yeah 
 do you live around here 
 sorry dont have one 
 why dont you go home to the old lady 
 does what 
 i think that about does it spooky 
 what do i do im a key figure in an ongoing government charade an annoyance to my superiors a joke among my peers spooky they call me spooky mulder whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun shouting to the heavens and anyone who will listen that the fix is in that our governments hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy that the sky is falling and when it hits its gonna be the shitstorm of all time 
 what do you do 
 a woman work 
 yup 
 poopy day 
 me 
 i need your clothes byers 
 they took her 
 you called N except the call was intercepted 
 scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting 
 when was that 
 they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma but you have been unconscious since they brought you in 
 penetration but not perforation 
 you were shot in the head the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate 
 what am i doing here 
 most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive i realize you are very lucky to be alive agent scully the ordeal you have endured has clearly affected you though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation 
 no they dont 
 wellwhere would you like me to start antarctica is a long way from dallas agent scully i cant very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you have made here bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism 
 what is it you find incredible 
 agent mulder 
 working with 
 i hope to we are working to develop this evidence 
 nothing completely conclusive 
 and you have conclusive evidence of this something to tie this claim of yours to the crime 
 yes i know 
 those are very serious allegations agent scully 
 that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen so their deaths and the reason for them wouldnt have to be explained 
 are you going to let us in on what exactly you are trying to prove 
 yes 
 you have been back to dallas 
 evidence of what 
 i apologize for making you wait i have brought some new evidence with me 
 special agent scully 
 they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus you will make sure the families are taken care of financially along with a sizeable donation to the community maybe a small roadside memorial 
 of what 
 tell them he was trying to save the young boys life and that he died heroically like the other firemen 
 this mans family will want to see the body laid to rest 
 incinerate it like the others 
 and if its unsuccessful 
 no nowe need to try our vaccine on it 
 do you want me to destroy this one too before it gestates 
 the developing organism is using his life energy digesting bone and tissue we have just slowed the process 
 how can this be 
 technically and biologically though he will never recover 
 this mans still alive 
 heat i think the coincident invasion of a host the fireman and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six 
 brought on by what 
 we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development which is nothing like we have ever seen 
 yes 
 you have got something to show me 
 kurtzweil we think 
 who 
 mulder was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence hes gone back there again someone has tipped him 
 do they know 
 there are complications 
 my lateness may have well been absence a course has already been taken 
 into what 
 its effect on the host has changed the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism its developed a way to modify the host body 
 strughold hes just gotten on a plane in tunis 
 who called this meeting 
 is it an emergency 
 we have a situation the members are assembling 
 yes 
 no dont bother 
 you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil 
 yeah i had an appointment for a pelvic examination 
 you looking for him for some other reason 
 selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer 
 whats that 
 feds are looking for him too real nice business hes got huh 
 looking for him for what 
 im looking for him 
 you got some kind of business with him 
 is this dr kurtzweils residence 
 show you right on a map 
 you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found 
 no just fossils far as i know 
 have you examined them 
 some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning we thought thered been another fatality but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town 
 was there anything in those offices that didnt go to dc 
 we werent expecting to find those remains of course they went right off to washington 
 im looking for anything out of the ordinary maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found 
 and why do you think it is you are standing here talking to me these people dont make mistakes agent mulder 
 your ass i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters 
 youd be shit out of luck if not for me you saw what you saw because i led you to it im putting my ass on the line for you 
 you are a liar you lied to me to gather information for you for your goddamn books didnt you 
 i told you he and i were old friends 
 you didnt know my father 
 i have been using you 
 you have been using me 
 yeah well i dont have them all 
 you told me you had answers 
 your guess 
 that would be my guess 
 a transportation system transgenic crops the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus 
 what do you think 
 what did it look like 
 you saw this experiment 
 im not sure a virus 
 what 
 yes on the texas border some kind of experiment something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks 
 you found something 
 you cant 
 how can i reach you 
 somethings gone wrong something unanticipated go back to dallas and dig or you are only going to find out like the rest of the country agent mulder when its too late 
 and they tell me im paranoid 
 i think you know the timetable has been set it will happen on a holiday when people are away from their homes when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country the president will declare a state of emergency at which time all federal agencies all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency fema agent mulder the secret government 
 negotiating with whom 
 the plague to end all plagues agent mulder a silent weapon for a quiet war the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure they have been working on this for fifty years while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon 
 a plague 
 what killed those men cant be identified in simple medical terms my god we cant even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv we have no context for what killed those men or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future of how it will be transmitted of the environmental factors involved 
 i will know soon enough 
 what killed them i wont even write about i tell you theyd do more than just harass me they have the future to protect 
 what killed those men 
 when we were young men in the military your father and i were recruited for a project they told us it was biological warfare a virus there were rumors about its origins 
 what was it 
 are you saying it wasnt such a small outbreak 
 and are you familiar with fema what the federal emergency management agencys real power is fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency to create a nonelected government think about that what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas 
 it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest us several years ago 
 according to the newspaper fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus are you familiar with the hanta virus agent mulder 
 you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency why 
 i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government the daily newspaper 
 how 
 i was right about dallas wasnt i agent mulder 
 i dont either but it sure sells books 
 dr kurtzweil im not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide i dont believe in the elders of zion the knights templar the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government 
 you know my work 
 you mean that apocalyptic trash you write i knew your name was familiar i just didnt know why 
 for what because im a dangerous man because i know too much about the truth 
 they want to discredit you for what 
 what is it kiddie porn again sexual battery of a patient i have had my license taken away in three states 
 not according to the men in blue 
 see this bullshit somebody knows im talking to you 
 do you 
 i think you are full of shit 
 and one little boy 
 you are saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen 
 michaud was a patriot the men hes loyal to know their way around dallas they blew that building to hide something maybe something even they couldnt predict 
 michaud was a twentytwo year veteran of the bureau 
 thats what im saying 
 before the bomb went off 
 those people were already dead 
 no they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there which is where the bodies were found but thats the thing 
 the federal building was too well guarded 
 whats the question nobodys asking why that building why not the federal building 
 he just let it explode 
 sac darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb 
 and whats that 
 well if you have got something to tell me you have got as long as it takes me to hail a cab 
 i came on my own after reading about the bombing in dallas 
 who sent you 
 im a doctor but i think i mentioned that obgyn 
 you a reporter 
 heard you come here now and again figured youd be needing a little drinky tonight 
 howd you find me 
 old friend of your fathers 
 i know the name why 
 my names kurtzweil dr alvin kurtzweil 
 yeah i did 
 you follow me out here for a reason 
 no i have been watching your career for a good while back when you were just a promising young agent before that 
 do i know you 
 standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding 
 hows that 
 yes you can you are going to make it scully 
 i cant go any farther 
 you got me but i think i know what they did with jimmy hoffa 
 where are we 
 we have got to keep moving 
 hang on im going to get you out of here 
 cold 
 i have got no allergy something this mulder i think i think you should call an ambulance 
 scully 
 no its 
 i think you are in anaphylactic shock 
 my pulse feels thready and i have got a funny taste in the back of my throat 
 somethings wrong im having lancinating pain my chest my motor functions are being affected im 
 scully 
 i think something stung me 
 what what happened 
 you saved me scully as different and frustrating as its been sometimes your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times have kept me honest and made me whole i owe you so much scully and you owe me nothing i dont want to do this without you i dont know if i can if i quit now they win 
 why was i assigned to you to debunk your work to reign you in to shut you down 
 you dont mulder you have never needed me i have only held you back i have got to go 
 i need you on this scully 
 im contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers 
 just like that 
 i have i did its done 
 after what you saw last night after all you have seen you cant just walk away 
 you are on the verge mulder please dont do this to me 
 we are close to something here we are on the verge 
 i can mulder i debated whether or not to even tell you in person because i knew 
 you cant quit scully 
 i already gave skinner my letter of resignation 
 salt lake city utah transfer effective immediately 
 what whats wrong 
 i dont know 
 whered they go 
 come on 
 what are you doing 
 run 
 yeah 
 scully 
 maybe maybe not 
 i hear the humming like electricity high voltage maybe 
 you hear that 
 for the purpose of what 
 cool in here temperatures being regulated 
 not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there 
 any thoughts on why anybodyd be growing corn in the middle of the desert 
 very weird 
 this is weird mulder 
 i have no idea 
 what do you think it is 
 pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope only to find myself standing right where i am right now at another dead end 
 been where 
 i dont believe this i dont fucking believe this yknow i have been here i have been here one too many times with you mulder 
 it may be extraterrestrial 
 mulder 
 this virus it 
 what do you mean by haul what are you not telling me here 
 yeah well they may this one 
 they haul gas in tanker trucks they haul oil in tanker trucks they dont haul viruses in tanker trucks 
 that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off to hide something bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself 
 of what exactly 
 we are not chasing trucks we are chasing evidence 
 i have got to be in washington dc in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas chasing phantom tanker trucks 
 what 
 this is great this is fitting 
 hey i was right about the bomb wasnt i 
 i dont know why i think they went right 
 you think they went left 
 we have got two choices one of them is wrong 
 where would they be going 
 about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction 
 what are my choices 
 thats the first question to answer if we are going to find them 
 and where are they going with it 
 i dont know mulder 
 unmarked tanker trucks what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks 
 no irrigation system somebodys covering their tracks 
 all the equipment is brand new 
 grounds dry about an inch down somebody just laid this down very recently id say 
 it looks pretty green for this climate 
 this looks like new grass to you 
 no it didnt show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests 
 and you have never seen anything like that 
 the bone was porous as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it 
 you are sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the firemans body in the morgue 
 i dont see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite not even a sewer or a storm drain 
 this is where he marked on the map scully where he says those fossils were unearthed 
 he didnt mention a park 
 that i dont know but if its through simple contact of blood to blood and if it doesnt respond to conventional treatments it could be a serious health threat 
 how was it contracted 
 something i couldnt show to anyone else not without more information and not without causing the kind of attention id just as soon avoid right now the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i have never seen before what it did to them it did extremely fast and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain it survives very nicely outside the body 
 what did you find 
 i wasnt planning on it particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen 
 you said you werent coming 
 mulder i cant im already way past the point of common sense here 
 i will have you back for it scully maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away 
 i have got a hearing tomorrow 
 i need you there with me i need your expertise on this the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by 
 mulder 
 scully listen to me im going home then im booking a flight to dallas im getting you a ticket too 
 i dont know 
 what kind of infection 
 evidence of a massive infection 
 what did you find 
 i cant really talk right now 
 why are you whispering 
 we are being blamed for these deaths scully i want to know what this man died of dont you 
 mulder this is going to take some time and somebodys going to figure out soon enough we are not even supposed to be here im in serious violation of medical ethics 
 i dont know but i have a hunch what you are going to find here isnt anything that can be categorized or easily referenced 
 you are saying the bombing was a coverup of what 
 id been told as much 
 you knew this man didnt die at the bomb site before we got here 
 i dont know what killed this man im not sure if anybody else could claim to either 
 you are telling me the cause of death on the report is false that this man didnt die from an explosion or from flying debris 
 and theres been no autopsy performed theres no y incision here no internal exam 
 theres some kind of cellular breakdown its completely edematous 
 its like jelly 
 and you are looking for 
 according to this tag 
 this is one of the firemen who died in dallas 
 just get dressed i will explain on the way 
 mulder what are you doing 
 get dressed scully 
 go home mulder its late 
 is that what youd like me to do 
 i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting 
 what are you implying scully 
 is that before or after you got the idea to come here 
 i was until about an hour ago 
 are you drunk mulder 
 why not its three am 
 no 
 i wake you 
 theres really no reason left for me to stay anymore maybe you should ask yourself if your hearts still in it too 
 you are quitting 
 they are not doing this mulder i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau i felt this was not an impediment but an opportunity to distinguish myself but it hasnt turned out that way and now if i were to be transferred to omaha or wichita or some field office where im sure i could rise it just doesnt hold the interest for me it once did not after what i have seen and done 
 this isnt about you scully they are doing this to me 
 because they wanted me to invalidate your work your investigations into the paranormal but i think this goes deeper than that 
 they were the ones that put us together 
 i think you must have an idea they cited a history of problems relating back to N 
 why 
 i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment 
 what what are you talking about 
 they have divided us mulder they are splitting us up 
 they are trying to divide us on this scully we cant let them 
 all i told them was the truth 
 whatever you told them in there you dont have to protect me 
 mulder get in the car 
 somethings not right 
 mulder move away from the door we are coming through it 
 scully 
 hang on im gonna get you out of there 
 thirteen fifty six 
 thirteen fifty nine thirteen fifty eight thirteen fifty seven 
 mulder tell me this is a joke 
 nice try mulder 
 scully get somebody to open this door 
 im in the vending room 
 where are you mulder 
 scully i found the bomb 
 scully 
 something sweet 
 alright what will it be coke pepsi a saline iv 
 i just did you are buying 
 panic have you ever seen me panic scully 
 i saw your face mulder there was a moment of panic 
 oh yeah had you big time 
 no you didnt 
 had you 
 its locked 
 now what 
 what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston i think its free beer night at the astrodome 
 you have got to quit looking for what isnt there they have closed the xfiles theres procedure to be followed here protocol 
 hows that 
 i know you are bored in this assignment but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now 
 the element of surprise scully random acts of unpredictability if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed categorized or easily referenced 
 jesus mulder 
 what happened to playing a hunch 
 mulder 
 mulder when a terrorist bomb threat is called in the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror if youd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device if we dont act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it lives could be lost 
 i think they have that covered 
 i know that but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street 
 you are looking for a bomb 
 i have just climbed twelve floors im hot and thirsty and im wondering to be honest what im doing here 
 whats wrong scully 
 no i havent 
 did you find something 
 im on the roof 
 where are you scully 
 mulder its me 
 thank you 
 why dont you go on ahead head and i will confirm authorization 
 they can patch you in through the switchboard 
 i dont have his number 
 well call general mcaddie 
 i dont know anything about that 
 general mcaddie is who requested our coming here we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately 
 general mcaddies 
 on whose orders 
 that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel 
 we are going to the morgue 
 i have got to find scully 
 what are you doing 
 im not taking any chances 
 are we being watched 
 i dont know 
 how deep does this go 
 i know agent scully reported your suspicions to opr on the basis of her report i sent techs over to sac michauds apartment they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas 
 whoever they are this goes right back to dallas it goes right back to the bombing 
 shes missing we have been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in 
 wheres scully 
 agent mulder 
 agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building that you wanted to go back 
 i breached protocol i broke contact with the sac i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device 
 shes in there right now saying the same thing about you 
 if they want someone to blame they can blame me agent scully doesnt deserve this 
 if it looks bad its bad for the fbi 
 but its not the lives we saved its the lives we didnt 
 agent mulder we both know that if you and agent scully hadnt taken the initiative to search the adjacent building you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred 
 and they want to blame us 
 you dont see whats going on here do you theres four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas lives have been lost no suspects have been named so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented that the fbi didnt do its job 
 she was with me 
 they are asking her for a narrative they want to know why she was in the wrong building 
 about what 
 sit down they are still talking to agent scully 
 my life is over go 
 what about you 
 find agent scully save her only her science can save the future 
 what alien environment 
 the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we have so assiduously protected for the last fifty years or it may not 
 how 
 you have precious little time what i have given you the alien colonists have no idea exists you hold in your hand the power to end the project 
 driver 
 let me out stop the car 
 dr kurtzweil is in the trunk 
 where is he 
 as your father knew things need to be sacrificed to the future 
 what happened to kurtzweil 
 i thought it only fair you should know given how hard you have worked 
 why are you telling me this 
 the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it those vaccinated against it and human or alien hybrids your father arranged for your sisters abduction he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program so that she would survive as a clone he had different hopes for you that you would uncover the truth about the project that you would stop it that you would fight the future 
 but he sacrificed his own daughter my sister samantha 
 imagine our surprise when they began to gestate my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists facilitating their programs to give us access to the virus in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure so that we might save ourselves as the last of the species your father wisely refused to believe this choosing hope over selfishness hope is the only future he had his children the only future any of us have 
 thats why you bombed the building the infected firemen the boy 
 until dallas we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism that mass infection would make us a slave race 
 your aliens agent mulder your little green men first landed here millions of years ago those that didnt leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age in the form of an evolved pathogen waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet using us as hosts against this we have no defense nothing but a weak vaccine do you see why it was kept secret why even the best men men like your father could not let the truth be known 
 what do you mean walked 
 aids the ebola virus on the evolutionary scale they are newborns this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs 
 no for god sake you have got it all backwards 
 this is what you have been conspiring to conceal a disease 
 a simple unstoppable lifeform what is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated living in a cave underground until it mutates and attacks 
 a virus 
 no though i have no way to prove otherwise the virus is extraterrestrial we know very little about it except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet 
 you are lying 
 a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with it must be administered with ninety six hours 
 what is it 
 i want to know where scully is 
 i think of it as an agreement a word your father liked to use 
 about the conspiracy 
 im quite prepared to tell you everything though there isnt much you havent guessed 
 yes 
 is she alive 
 i have answers for you 
 wheres scully 
 hes come and gone 
 what happened to kurtzweil 
 mr mulder 
 no you need only take away what is most precious to him 
 you need not kill a man to destroy him 
 you cant kill mulder hes got too much light on him 
 and mulder 
 no one believes kurtzweil or his books hes a toiler a crank 
 we have allowed this man his freedom his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial has he outlived his usefulness to us 
 well without a cure for the virus we are nothing more than digestives anyway 
 our vaccine may have no effect 
 cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves 
 and if it doesnt by cooperating now we are but beggars to our demise our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all 
 let me remind you who is the new race and who is the old what could be gained by withholding anything from them by pretending to ignorance our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable to start colonization early 
 in hope of what learning that its true that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms 
 we are going to tell them what we have found what we have learned turn over a body infected with the gestating organism 
 this isnt colonization its spontaneous repopulation all our work if its true then they have been using us all along we have been laboring under a lie 
 the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual reevaluations for us about our place in their colonization 
 my god 
 we have been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves 
 more concerns than that 
 im sorry my grandson fell and broke his leg 
 we began to worry some of us have traveled so far and you are the last to arrive 
 give a kiss to edward 
 give a kiss to edward 
 thanks miriam say hi to henry and 
 i will come by tomorrow after work with dinner 
 i know 
 i dont need them anymore 
 i refilled the zyprexa and atavan 
 agent novak i didnt get a chance to clear him 
 whats wrong 
 damn him 
 baked in a pie 
 four and twenty blackbirds 
 a pocketful of rye 
 what happened 
 is it cold in here 
 no no 
 catherine im about to start if you want me to wait or 
 she said convincingly 
 i will be fine 
 this isnt your responsibility remember that dont let them use guilt as a tool if you want to stop say so 
 he needs to be turned over 
 like a new years day hangover 
 disorientation nausea migraines hallucinations insomnia paranoia 
 the first what six or seven times i went in remember what happened 
 why did we stop 
 nothing 
 a pocketful of fucking rye whats wrong 
 sing a song of sixpence 
 thats my girl 
 i have got to feed my cat besides i want to get to bed early 
 henry wants me to try this vietnamese place hes wild about want to come 
 okay 
 dont bring it home in this 
 i dont want you up all night reading edwards case file of the nine millionth time balance dear girl is the key leave the work here 
 yes mother 
 good we need you healthy and relaxed you are going to eat well meditate exercise and watch mindless television 
 no 
 you are sure any more nightmares 
 okay okay 
 and he might blame you for terrifying him that one moment could erase all you have accomplished and if that happened the trust he has in you is gone 
 id be there for him 
 yes but you are a willing participant picture edward in a strange place lost frightened 
 i do it all the time 
 if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind it could be devastating for him imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world 
 it could take years for me to get past the barriers hes created 
 i have heard this argument before its not happening 
 he creates the obstacles he decides which games to play 
 shush 
 miriam 
 i dont want to find out 
 why not just once a trial run what harm could it do 
 we have been over this a dozen times no 
 someday you can we all believe that 
 she thinks i can bring edward back 
 she adores you 
 lucien baines 
 he hates me 
 mockylock is a pain in the ass 
 mockylock is the bogeyman mockylock wants me where i am 
 almost mockylock showed up 
 did we go sailing 
 fourandtwenty blackbirds 
 a pocketful of rye 
 sing a song of sixpence 
 no thank you 
 no problem 
 thank you 
 i got it 
 they are hungry 
 i dont know i think it does you know catherine if you ever want to talk about it what happened to stargher that last time 
 it doesnt matter 
 he also says that until proven differently julia hickson was found as a result of good oldfashioned detective work 
 all yours my boss says its one of the strangest requests the bureaus ever had 
 hes mine 
 so you say 
 i told you you have to be optimistic believe in them 
 well look at that 
 good for them 
 yep eloped 
 i heard julia and john got married 
 absolutely abigail 
 you sure about this 
 give her a minute hello valentine 
 that went well 
 i cant leave him 
 come on 
 carl do you know like on a map 
 where the hell are we 
 he brought you to me didnt he if you want julia to live trust me trust him 
 little boy thats him 
 he wants us to follow the little boy 
 like hell wait 
 wait 
 okay okay 
 remember julia hickson is priority number one nothing else matters find out where she is 
 yes i am 
 you are sure of that 
 a child can experience abuse worse than charlies and grow up to be someone who would never ever hurt another living thing 
 tell me 
 what difference does it make 
 what happened 
 what happened to charles gish 
 maybe this is a big fucking waste of time 
 if you believe that 
 evil 
 then what is he 
 its hard for me to see stargher as human capable of something like remorse 
 dont you feel there are different sides to every personality maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act we are all human 
 whoa hold on arent they the same guy 
 not stargher not really hes split himself right down the middle good or evil right or wrong merciful or cruel a monster and an innocent child if i could reach the boy 
 this is stargher we are talking about 
 he might tell me about julia the part of him that wants to help that feels shame and remorse who wants to be redeemed 
 you think you can do this dont you 
 this is going to sound terrible but i dont think she matters anymore not to him he never finished her the othershe was able to make them his 
 what about julia 
 you were right theres a part of him that knows the truth about what he did about himself 
 i did yeah 
 you thought stargher wanted to be caught 
 as soon as i met him you knew id say yes he makes julia real for me 
 you are the shrink you tell me 
 whyd you bring him here 
 a kingdom his utopia life without consequence or restriction hes not even carl stargher anymore hes this idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases without fear a horrible primitive ugly thing i dont want to talk in here 
 what did you see 
 with stargher i saw things 
 thats what therapists are for right 
 just like we all have fantasies right things only we know that we dont share 
 absolutely i suppose everyone does 
 do you feel theres a side of yourself you dont show people 
 peter okay 
 agent novak 
 ah the part of us that cant be explained 
 the soul the spirit whatever you want to call it 
 what then 
 it doesnt have much to do with science 
 i read about a woman in texas who was in a coma for seven years every time her husband came to visit her heart would beat faster isnt that something i dont know what name scientists have for something like that 
 no not at all from what i understand he knows im here isnt that right 
 do you think thats funny 
 edward baines i presume hi ed im pete 
 i know him 
 you dont know the procedure 
 this man is deeply disturbed he 
 how hard could it be 
 i realize that 
 i still dont understand why i cant do this this isnt some troubled kid you are dealing with 
 okay lets assume he wanted you to find him that some part of him hated what he was doing most likely that part is dead schizophrenics with whalens infraction sever all ties with the real world im sorry i really am 
 sometimes once they have been caught they feel a need for disclosure they have so much they want to tell but they have never had a sympathetic ear they need someone to understand why stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully it was part of the ritual some werent found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean but these last three they were still in water always in water but listen he wasnt just careless it went beyond that 
 really i dont work with violent cases i work with children but even a kid lies they love it when they get you to believe something that isnt true dont you think stargher would do the same 
 theres always a chance they will confess 
 as far as i needed 
 what if he wasnt like this what if he was normal conscious how far would you go 
 i bet we can fix it 
 mockylock is the bogeyman mockylock wants me where i am 
 oh no no you dont 
 mockylock 
 who says 
 s broken 
 what now 
 hes beautiful 
 you liked him 
 i never kid my wife hates it says im too serious 
 you are kidding me 
 yep and guess who they hired to seal up the place 
 delano 
 lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near delano bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land its just sitting there 
 that hoist with the winch 
 already there 
 i need you to find something in the basement 
 agent cole 
 just graduated law school single mom had a twoyearold daughter 
 she the one from santa cruz 
 shes bringing stargher into hers 
 instead of going into his mind 
 it would take hours to reroute the system and even if i did i shouldnt 
 whats wrong 
 she changed the codes 
 i think thats the whole point 
 i hate to admit it but theres something perversely satisfying about this 
 pump in two liters of pure oxygen please henry 
 thats why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely we dont want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation 
 initiating connection 
 intravenous administration complete 
 catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy when we started there were a number of test subjects other therapists who acted as receivers all they did was observe and report nothing more but catherine she had the ability to feel what was happening she understood and the patient responded edward engaged her in dialogue took her places showed her things he knew she cared 
 not a gift a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex thats all a genetic fluke 
 they took care of that thank you henry 
 shouldnt we get a catheter in him 
 completely unaware 
 what about the cat 
 awaiting his arrival 
 hows the patient 
 federal bureau of investigation maam we know all see all 
 thats a secret 
 thanks you six weeks off does a body good i heard she got the approval to try the reversal with edward 
 you are looking well 
 dr kent 
 agent novak 
 yes but you are going to sit down right now i have to 
 is she alright 
 i doubt that 
 i am im a pretty boring guy 
 i know your partners here but its very important that you are honest 
 no 
 what about narcotics 
 no 
 any psychiatric medication 
 prevacid for my stomach 
 i have to ask you some things are you taking any prescription drugs 
 absolutely 
 nervous 
 no 
 i have done this you know been inside 
 yes 
 into stargher inside 
 that was with edward shes accustomed to his world starghers mind is unfamiliar territory shes lost someone has to go in remind her whats really happening and get her out until then shes at his mercy 
 when we got here you just topped and pulled her out 
 i will get her 
 catherine 
 stargher is in custody the functional equivalent of being under arrest normally wed mirandize him and if he didnt lawyer up wed interrogate him but because of his condition he doesnt have the capacity to waive those rights 
 what about the legalities of this 
 sometime yesterday morning 
 when did he lapse into the coma 
 its his dog 
 the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago and we got the match 
 gentlemen i believe an albino dog is rare indeed 
 the dogs an albino hed love an animal like that 
 now 
 now 
 i need it 
 anne vicksey didnt own a dog 
 so 
 grandparents live over in davis

 richard hi 
 im daffy 
 yes 
 excuse me 
 i wouldnt know anything about that sir 
 why not thai girls best in the world thai food best in the world thai dope best in the world 
 i dont think so 
 you go to patpong see smoke from pussy ping pong ball from pussy razor blade from pussy bird from pussy 
 traveler 
 what are you doing in thailand tourist 
 fuck off 
 what about moliere 
 was there a shark did you see a shark 
 she just went under the water she was pulled under oh god i dont see her 
 what happened 
 she is gone 
 a bit fucking late 
 im sorry 
 well to be honest etienne i would rather have not known about it 
 nothing i just thought you ought to know 
 well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it 
 yes 
 big 
 i dont know just a fin over there about a hundred meters 
 a shark fin 
 a fin 
 what 
 richard i saw a fin 
 i think we are about half way 
 we are ok 
 everyone ok 
 i have no idea but it looks like a long way 
 so how many miles do you think it is 
 we think in miles not kilometers 
 so 
 i dont know im american 
 yeah ok forget it we wont tell anyone 
 richard its secret thats the whole point 
 we are going to swim one or two kilometers across open sea from one uninhabited island to another something goes wrong what then 
 why 
 oh great not far at all i dont like to be negative but do you think we should let someone know where we are going 
 one or two kilometers 
 yes of course i can swim how far do you think it is 
 thats the wrong one 
 he will not take us to the island its in the national park and it is forbidden to go there but we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night 
 there is one problem 
 nice work 
 its arranged tomorrow morning eight hundred bath 
 of course but look all these people if that place existed theyd all be there 
 it would be nice though if there was a place like that you know that no one could get to 
 we moved rooms because of him 
 oh that noise yes he certainly did 
 she means your neighbor the scotsman 
 the noise dont worry you are on holiday 
 good morning 
 bonjour 
 richard 
 two 
 one kilometer 
 you can swim 
 we leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim 
 it was ridiculous all this at three oclock in the morning 
 but he has been there off course 
 its on an island that no one get to 
 he said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach 
 what idiot would lend him money it would disappear 
 he tried to borrow money from us 
 if its too far then we will drown but if we dont try then we will never know 
 too far 
 its just the sky richard 
 sorry i thought i was doing quite well 
 that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them 
 richard you know something 
 exactly 
 so on one you are rich on another poor on one you are a murderer on another the victim 
 there are infinite worlds out there where anything that can happen does happen 
 incredible 
 you realize that in the eternity of space there is a planet just like this one where you are photographing back towards us you are photographing yourself 
 one night i will get the perfect photograph 
 i think so too 
 sshh etienne will be angry if i wake him he thinks i waste film taking photographs of the sky 
 francoise 
 i think its a bad idea to tell anyone 
 no 
 have you told someone 
 swim 
 we swim 
 so from there to there 
 hi there here take a look 
 hi 
 i hope our noise did not keep you awake 
 not too bad 
 did you sleep well 
 eh bonsoir 
 bonsoir 
 uhhuh 
 so theres an urban myth well more of a rural myth going around here at the moment its about a beach 
 so 
 exactly always happened to someone else 
 woman bites chicken leg turns out to be a mouse or a rat its an urban myth 
 do you know the kentucky friend mouse story 
 where did you lose it 
 we lost our key 
 then let him destroy me now let him crush me like the conceited bully he is go ahead kill me here i am do it 
 and you if you had come out of egypt you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf 
 i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt moriah and we still live in terror 
 watch your language 
 i do i follow it but okay say god provided the ram so what once abraham raised the knife in his heart it was as if hed killed him he could never forget that and neither could isaac look at him hes traumatized hes a putz for the rest of his life by the end he cant tell jacob from esau 
 no one follows that midrash 
 theres midrash supporting this my father read a book by shalom spiegel that isaac actually died and was reborn 
 you think based on what 
 we have free will and intelligence which god allegedly gave us 
 but danny if hashem is everything and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions 
 the nazis did everything the fhrer told them you do everything the torah tells you or the rebbe identical slave mentality 
 they sound like you 
 read the early zionists on european jewry they sound like goebbels 
 they had sabra and shattila 
 they dont have extermination camps 
 they are racist they are militaristic they act like bullyboys in the territories 
 the zionists arent nazis 
 whereas avis a zionist nazi 
 i rest my case hes a jewish nazi he always was 
 whats a fascist 
 what are you doing here i thought you were a nazi 
 they only kill them when they love them 
 fine go ahead touch the letters 
 thats a movie you moron 
 that was an ark man that was a torah they fucked around with it and the torah melted their faces 
 what 
 didnt you see raiders of the lost ark 
 hes an asshole 
 fucking danny man 
 shes been giving me the eye shes hot so i wait till the owner goes up front 
 are you shitting me right in the store 
 so she takes the pants in back where they try them on and i think fuck it 
 just dont 
 why the fuck not 
 yeah but not on the letters 
 no you dont if you hated them youd study them so youd know why you hate them you know what tefillin is tsitsis shotness you know the kaddish from the kiddush eichmann he went to israel he studied the torah the talmud the mishnah the whole bit he hated jews 
 fuck you i hate the jews at least as much as you do 
 how come you dont know it how can you say you hate the jews when you dont know anything about 
 how come you know all this shit 
 the mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters they thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there with secret alternative meanings 
 fire 
 its called the flame alphabet its supposed to be the word of god written in fire 
 lets look at the fucking thing 
 i dont but 
 what do you care 
 billings if hitler didnt kill six million why is he your hero concentration camps all over europe and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand hes a putz 
 yeah hes a respected scholar even noam chomsky says he 
 where did you read this robert faurisson 
 danny its true there were no six million at most two hundred thousand jews died in the camps and the majority of them were from disease and 
 oh please 
 whyd we have to leave so fast 
 yes 
 do we have to listen to this shit 
 we will go to the country sometime okay 
 you coming 
 read mein kampf hitler had all his best ideas in prison 
 what do you like it here 
 then i wont bring you 
 bring your friends we are not his friends 
 who am i who are you you schmucks you cant even make a decent swastika give me the paint give it to me 
 who the fuck are you 
 what do you think you are doing 
 maybe i am maybe we are all jews now whats the difference 
 you are a jew maybe you dont realize it but you are 
 you will 
 i dont care about money 
 no they dont not the smart ones look i will give you five grand if you can document your taxexempt status but when you fall off this horse come see me i can show you how to make a lot of money 
 people still need values beliefs 
 forget the jewish stuff it doesnt play anymore theres only the market now and it doesnt care who you are 
 yeah i read your piece its very smart and very wrong 
 actually i think this moment has possibilities that 
 fiftys an exaggeration anyway that was a different moment things were possible that arent now 
 you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine 
 this this is a joke i will give your group a thousand bucks 
 i have a job 
 you write that come work for me you have got a lot to learn i can teach it to you 
 you dont own this place 
 you gotta get out of here 
 miriam called looking for you she said you might come so i 
 you eat first then you light once you light its yom kippur which means you are fasting so you canteat 
 look just light the candles with me then we will eat you have to eat 
 yeah okay but what ifwhat if submittingbeing crushed being nothing not mattering what if thats the best feeling we can have 
 and be crushed 
 he commands it whether he exists or not look we can fight him and be crushed or we can submit 
 nothing why are you doing this i thought god didnt exist 
 no what are you looking for 
 shit did you talk to your mother today 
 i dont know i just want to try it 
 is it like eichmann are we goofing 
 come on we can be like eichmann he studied torah he hated jews 
 lina come here 
 you cant do you know how many people i have brought intothe movement 
 i mean kiddush lets say kiddush and shave my head fuck through a sheet all that stuff come on just for fun to see what its like 
 kaddish is the prayer for the dead 
 okay why dont we light candles on friday lets light candles and say the kaddish 
 you want a punch in the mouth 
 cause he wasnt a rabbi 
 believe me adolf hitler couldnt possibly have hated the jews as much as i do not in a billion years you know why 
 is that why you became a nazi so you could talk about jews incessantly 
 the real nazis hitler goebbels they talked about jews incessantly you ever read their diaries 
 do they 
 nazis talk about it all the time 
 its all you talk about jewish jewish jewish nobody talks about it that much except the jews 
 what you think im jewish 
 oh am i learning it faster than you did maybe im smarter 
 plus you have nothing else to do all day 
 i told you im good at this 
 you are learning the hebrew really fast 
 judaism doesnt even need god you have the torah the law thats your fucking god the books closed 
 no i think you shouldnt 
 you think i should just because theres no reason 
 you shouldnt 
 why should i submit 
 dont curse in front of it 
 fuck that 
 no nothing follows you dont do it because its smart or stupid or it saves your soul you are not saved nobodys saved you do it because the torah tells you do you submit to the torah 
 and belief follows 
 about doing things you light candles say prayers keep the sabbath visit the sick 
 whats it about 
 nothing but nothingnessjudaisms not about belief 
 christianitys silly but at least theres something to believe in or not believe judaism theres nothing 
 no difference 
 vasitem lechem pessel tomonat and make no graven image of the lord or the form of any figure or of man or woman or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything because hes not like anything not only cant you see him or hear him you cant even think about him i mean whats the difference between that and him not existing 
 vasitem 
 payn tashchiton vashiytem 
 vuvzayinchettet 
 with you theres a tragic dimension 
 even though his dick is so big 
 the sex is better 
 they dont put them in the torah i will get you a chumash they will have them therebetgimeldalidhay how come you are here instead of with curtis besides the hebrew lessons 
 where are they 
 its silent it holds a place takes a vowel the vowels are little dots that go under the letters 
 it looks a little like a swastika 
 good question both aleph 
 who gets contaminated the jews or the gentiles 
 you cant curse in front of it either 
 what assholes 
 see the jews love to separate things the holy from the profane milk from meat wool from linen the sabbath from the week the jew from the gentile as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that 
 yeah its stupid put it on or i wont teach you 
 thats stupid 
 they think its the word of god and its holy and the flesh isnt 
 why not 
 put something on you are not supposed to be naked in front of it 
 im good at languages 
 hebrews very difficult it would take years 
 know your enemy cause its a basic text of western culture i want to read it in the original okay 
 why 
 i want to learn to read it 
 and god said to avram take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your fathers house into the land a different land and i will show you 
 whats it mean 
 vayomer adonai el avram lech lecha mayartzcha oomimohladtcha oombayt avaycha el haertez asher arecha 
 oh yeah 
 vayomer and he said it goes the other way 
 cause i want to know what is this word this one here 
 what do you care 
 but you can read it the hebrew right 
 no 
 do you know it like that by heart 
 that was a later invention its not in the scrolls anyway the jews know where the sentences end they know the whole thing by heart every word every letter 
 how come theres no punctuation 
 i stole it from a synagogue 
 whered you get this 
 no 
 im coming to your room tonight 
 hes at a home out here 
 your father 
 you cant 
 when can i see you 
 im talking to you right now whos linda

 whos linda 
 then how come you are talking to me 
 bigger and better 
 oh really 
 too many good players down here im with one right now 
 you werent complaining about my play last time 
 i bet he didnt realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one 
 yes i am basically i am 
 you are not like the others are you your friends 
 thats stupid why would they 
 you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness 
 killing himself 
 whats he care about 
 i guess his parents are he doesnt care about that 
 is he a nazi 
 hes in a mental institution hes been there for ten years off and on mostly on 
 are they still together 
 they are my fathers hes from argentina my mothers family went there during the war thats where they met 
 how come so many of the books are in spanish 
 and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms 
 und die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilze 
 you want it to be an event 
 why no silencer 
 i just read it 
 whered you read all that stuff 
 i work at the big boy warehouse in queens i drive a forklift 
 you are not in school what do you do 
 at first no one will know why the victims are being killed 
 which is what 
 abstraction they are obsessed with abstraction 
 disease what disease 
 the point is the modern world is a jewish disease 
 too christian you know jameson paul virilio 
 too difficult 
 nobody reads that stuff anymore 
 have you read toynbee spengler 
 why dont you come visit we will have a rematch 
 thats a much easier game 
 he called me up he wanted to talk to me about my ideas 
 i doubt it how did you find out 
 i didnt notice his shoes did your mother know he was there 
 really which one i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes 
 did you know that there was a new york times reporter there that night 
 i dont i was just curious how full of shit you were 
 i didnt realize you cared 
 yeah i remember kill any jews yet 
 carla its me dannydanny balint we met at that 
 im stealing it 
 why are you taking that 
 nothing lets go 
 whatd you say 
 shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod 
 whos eichmann 
 whos eichmann 
 i will go look 
 i thought there were people here 
 we need intellectuals we have enough thugs already 
 danny the night we met you said the name ilio manzetti we were impressed we were excited but here it is september and mr manzetti is still walking around breathing the air 
 hes jewish manzetti 
 an investment banking house 
 lina the thousandyear reich barely lasted a decade do you really want to go down that road again in america of all places where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues 
 its a romantic movement curtis it always has been 
 yes of course but that only plays in this room with people who arent embarrassed to call themselves nazis if you want a modern fascism you dont mention jews 
 did you see how they reacted to him 
 i thought we agreed no anti semitismits exactly what we are trying to put behind us trash the blacks fine but 
 i have been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil hitler how am i supposed to 
 that doesnt seem to be happening does it 
 what aboutmanzetti the synagogues 
 i have been waiting all my life for something like this 
 we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream works like the bell curve sociobiology antizionism anti immigration the communitarian issue we will hold conferences invite liberals blacks jews chomsky cockburn stanley crouch shahack 
 whats that okay surprise us 
 a week or so theres something i want to do here first 
 they left an hour ago you mind some personal advice forget carla thats not the side your breads buttered on how soon can you get back to the city 
 what about mrs moebius and 
 leo strauss i have got to go to boston i came to say goodbye 
 its the truth 
 im sure they are but what do we accomplish by pointing it out 
 they are liars and cowards 
 insulting people who were in the camps whats the point 
 id have to research it study his routines his security but ideally on a new york street at midday using a smallcaliber automatic without a silencer 
 how would you kill him 
 totally the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven 
 isnt that what we want germany all over again only done right this time 
 but when it comes out the public will be outraged it will look like germany all over again 
 id say nothing after two or three people will try to find a pattern a reason 
 you wouldnt announce it 
 no but deep down beneath the tolerance they learn on television nothings changed the very word makes their skin crawl it isnt even hate really its more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor we want to step on it crush it we dont even know why its a physical reaction everyone feels it 
 they used to today its not an issue 
 people hate jews do you agree 
 that would be a catastrophic mistake 
 decentralized nonviolent increasingly mainstream we will see antiabortion antiimmigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby christian identity types tax resisters and even some libertarians 
 obviously 
 more cultural than political 
 get the fuck away from me 
 its too late if i didnt somebody else would yom kippur starts at sundown will you go to synagogue 
 if i tell you will you pull the story not write about me 
 who killed manzetti 
 yeah and what are you a times man a presbyterian impotent a prick 
 i dont think you know what you are 
 you work for the new york times your whole job in life is not to understand things like me 
 explain it so i can 
 i dont look stay out of what you dont understand 
 how do you reconcile the two 
 what were you following me 
 two days ago you addressed a nazi rally last week you went to a torah study group 
 no 
 did you kill ilio manzetti 
 yes infinitely more they would become as god 
 but if the jews are strengthened by hate wouldnt this destruction you speak of by love or by any other means in fact make them more powerful than they are already 
 does that mean you deny what he says is true yes or no 
 its slander its reckless disregard i will sue you and your fucking jew paper 
 give me a reason not to 
 to discredit me because i know who they are look i thought i explained it to you those people can say or do anything and they will its all narrative to them its are you going to print what this guy said 
 why would nadelman lie 
 listen to me 
 thats what im trying to find out danny who am i fucking with here 
 do you know who you are fucking with here 
 were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else 
 look at me do i look jewish look 
 so you are saying its not true 
 you believe that and you call yourself a reporter 
 he says you were bar mitzvahed there in march N 
 who how would i know him 
 do you know rabbi stanley nadelman he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park 
 what excuse me you are kidding right 
 differences exist of course but they are irrelevant for the jew his jewishness dominates everything even the ones who renounce it who hate it who want to cut it out of their hearts a knifecant escape they are still just jews 
 are all jews the same 
 notice the israelis a fundamentally secular society they no longer need judaism because they have soil the real jew is a wanderer a nomad he has no roots no attachments so he universalizes everything he cant hammer a nail plow a field he can only buy and sell invest capital manipulate markets he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books ideas numbers this is his strength take the great jewish minds marx freud einstein what have they given us communism infantile sexuality and the atom bomb in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe they have taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare irrational urges and relativity a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt why because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread nothing but nothingness nothingness without end 
 of course they are jews 
 those arent jews 
 he has israel 
 deracinate tear out the roots a people a real people derives its genius from the land the sun the sea the soil this is how they know themselves but the jew doesnt have soil 
 the jews clearly control the media and the banks investment banks not the commercial ones but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality they undermine traditional life they deracinate society 
 so fine its not that the jew the jews own the media and the banks its that they are sexually corrupt 
 lets just say i have done due diligence 
 danny what makes you think you know all this 
 you are not listening he isnt better he gives pleasure but thats actually a weakness 
 does that mean the jew is the better lover 
 real men white christian men we fuck a woman we make her come with our cocks but the jew doesnt like to penetrate and thrust he cant assert himself that directly so he resorts to perversions oral sex is technically a perversion you know that dont you after a woman has been with a jewish man she never wants a normal partner again a normal man 
 female 
 because the jew is essentially female 
 why 
 yes its very pleasurable but the jews are obsessed with it you know why 
 everybody likes to dont they 
 and jewish men like to get it 
 i dont know is that right 
 jewish girls like to give head right 
 notice like what 
 and what did you notice 
 whats that go to do withi have gone out with a with jewish women why 
 did you ever fuck one guy 
 what 
 you ever fuck a jewish girl 
 sexuality what do you mean 
 let me give you an example sexuality 
 a poison 
 the jews are different blacks are disgusting and inferior but its like criticizing a retarded child the jews area poison in the human well 
 danny what about the jews 
 german mine too so who do you thinks given more to the world the germans beethoven goethe nietzsche or the entire continent of africa ibos bantus mandingos 
 my mothers family is french my fathers was german originally 
 what should i be a white inferior ist a multicultural zulu egalitarian let me ask where are your people from 
 it helps me concentrate so does that mean you are a white supremacist 
 in the movement the racialist movement we believe theres a hierarchy of the races not just in iq but in the civilization the art the forms of government the civilizations that each race produces why are you writing this down if you are recording it 
 the other night you said the modern world is a jewish disease could you elaborate on that 
 i agree 
 curtis is a politician and a bit of a hustler hes not a thinker 
 what about curtis zampf 
 im trying to figure out where the radical right is going to nexti thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting 
 no yeah fine go ahead so whats this about is this about me 
 is it okay if i record this 
 theres a bomb here its going to go off at seventhirty 
 you shut up who do you think you are 
 fucking kike 
 danny im trying to save you 
 the truth doesnt mean anything to you does it 
 think about your father your sister 
 i cant say that 
 and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an antisemite if youd had any idea somebody would take it seriously you never would have said it 
 but i wasnt 
 all right what if all along you were actually infiltrating the nazis to expose them 
 i was just talking i look i cant help what i think 
 so are you but they will believe you lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea that you proposed it in a meeting at her house ah jesus danny what were you thinking are you glad manzettis dead do you really want to kill jews you want to kill me 
 you are lying 
 it was a nine millimeter 
 a fortyfive 
 you are telling me you killed him you killed him bullshit what kind of gun did you use 
 with the shoes there was more than one 
 which times guy 
 you mean the times guy 
 i work in the das office you go to those meetings half the people there are informants 
 how did you 
 tell me about lina moebius 
 this is me 
 i cant help what i think 
 you know the joke a jews shipwrecked on a desert island when they rescue him they see hes built two synagogues they say for vhat do you need two synagogues he says vun to pray in and vun id never set foot in so long as i live so help me god you pray in the one youd never set foot inand vice versa 
 point out all the lies and fuckedup thinking 
 that doesnt mean i dont like hearing it 
 i thought you hated torah 
 to hear them read torah 
 why did you come tonight to see me 
 the arguments anyway 
 i always won 
 yes 
 no 
 i want you to do it on the outside too 
 dont tell me what i 
 you do it on the inside 
 i dont do that 
 i want you to say kaddish for her its the only thing she asked from us 
 how did you get the fucking number 
 lina you said if i was going to plant a bomb i should 
 beth shalom what are you talking about who is this 
 beth shalom like you wanted 
 what is happening 
 lina its happening tonight 
 hello 
 we want to talk to you about something we are about to launch an aboveground intellectually serious fascist movement 
 fine 
 how have things been going 
 forget manzetti take on something simple something you can actually accomplish maybe hed be more valuable in the city 
 you mean ilio manzetti 
 do you feel you are making progress here 
 ilio manzettiformer ambassador to france managing partner at damon schwarzchild 
 so what jew would you kill first 
 we are already marginal we are saying what no one else has the guts to say isnt that precisely our appeal 
 curtis is afraid you will marginalize us 
 without blood a willingness to spill it theres no real power no authority 
 i was going to ask you the same thing 
 are you with the fbi mr balint or any other law enforcement agency 
 from the rhineland originally 
 what part of germany are you people from

 may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you 
 and so on this the most solemn day of the jewish year a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that 
 curtis is always more complicated than he seems even now 
 the papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague curtis zampf has been a federal informant for the past two years do you believe that 
 yes and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the final solution really who but a jew would want to kill ilio manzetti simply because he was jewish who thinks about such things 
 in the third reich werent a number of highranking nazis of jewish origin 
 i think antisemitism today is largely a jewish phenomenon wouldnt you agree 
 what do you mean 
 none whatsoever but i have to admit im not terribly surprised 
 you are saying that when he first appeared at your house you had no idea he was jewish 
 you take care of yourself johana

 bonita you shouldnt be discouraged so easily 
 of course

 but your man isnt quite a god 
 i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods take leda for example sleeping with jupiter who came to earth as a swan well can you imagine leda announcing to her swan you are going to be a father my little chickadee

 tell me why dont you go and get your medal 
 look at me these arent lungs these are tanks how long can you hold your breath 
 the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it

 two years younger than you 
 if we dont im going to beat you 
 why 
 well about everything 
 everything about what

 i remember hi roberto 
 thats too easy every time i beat a record theres always some dumbshit asking me dyou know that french guy mayol hes supposed to be very good too bad he doesnt compete so you are going to come with me to taormina first because you are my friend and second because you dont have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure i will see you there 
 you are the best enzo 
 no all you need is to want to be the best 
 i dont want to be in any competition i dive because i like to not to beat a record dont you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him 
 because im sure you are dying to beat me

 you are the father 
 thats good thats wonderful its wonderful for you 
 jacques im pregnant 
 i saw how it has to be 
 you have got to tell me what happened 
 because you have to find a good reason to come back up again and i always have a hard time finding one 
 why 
 the feeling of slipping without falling the hardest is once you are at the bottom 
 when you dive with that machine what does it feel like 
 no i will be fine can you just hand me a glass of water 
 you want to lie down for a while 
 its nothing just the long trip im a little jetlagged 
 whats wrong 
 you go back i will walk 
 jacques 
 im putting you on the coin your essence that way you will always be with me when i dive 
 what are you doing 
 nothing 
 what 
 i dont know it didnt feel right im going to bed im tired 
 you will try again tomorrow 
 i didnt dive 
 and you

 why did you take me to the hotel if you live here 
 okay in that case im at the airport in nice 
 absolutely positive 
 you sure 
 not at all 
 im being a pain huh 
 its me again 
 hello 
 you go down to the bottom of the sea where the water isnt even blue anymore where the sky is only a memory and you float there quietly quietly and stay there and you decide that you will die for them only then do they start coming out they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them if its sincere if its pure they will be with you and take you away forever 
 no tell me 
 do you know how it is do you know what you are supposed to do to meet a mermaid 
 uh ah a story 
 then tell me a story 
 its hard you know you are so far away and i dont know what else to say 
 well then talk to me some more

 yes you do you know exactly what im talking about you are afraid i want to hold onto you and i do but you are not ready at least not for me

 jacques you set a world record

 please move slowly you are rocking the boat 
 especially the sneakers 
 thank you 
 you look adorable 
 its too loud for me 
 i thought youd be at the dinner 
 maybe on earth there is one but not when you dive you see to dive deep into the sea for no reason just to do it its a feeling i dont know how to say this voluptuous 
 i guess but you know im american and i have mostly been taught to be competitive theres always pleasure of being the best 
 yes maybe i dont know i dont like competitions it ruins the fun dont you think 
 just because i would have liked to visit the town see the coast i dont know anybody expect for you

 you called the police

 i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time 
 and the new stereo 
 they got the new tv 
 again 
 you are back hello we were burgled 
 sally 
 i changed the lock you son of a bitch 
 yes its magic 
 but doesnt jacques dive without anything 
 that isnt for the divers actually its for the balloon it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator without it with the pressure at the bottom the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed 
 whats that little air bottle on the machine 
 those are the divers who go down N to N feet they dive with a heliumoxygen mixture at that depth compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide 
 and those 
 of course thats what they are for 
 if there was a problem they could do something right 
 they are paramedics they wait at N feet 
 what are they for 
 let him sleep 
 i will go see how hes doing 
 yes 
 wait professor 
 then goodbye 
 you have made me a happy insurance person 
 okay okay you will have it by the end of the week hows that 
 okay listen just get the customs office to send me a copy as fast as possible we cant send you new equipment until our file is complete okay 
 his mothers an american he spent half of his life in the states id try english if i were you 
 will he understand spanish 
 coffee might be nice 
 shouldnt somebody take him a blanket or something 
 for one thing its his job as for the rest of it i wish i knew 
 why is he doing this 
 it depends he should come up soon unless hes decided to stay for the night 
 how long can he stay down without breathing 
 hes in the fluoroscope now listen to his heart impressive huh the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesnt even feed the limbs anymore its a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins until now 
 he isnt going to breathe 
 but how is he going to breathe 
 my dear science is a cruel mistress 
 in the spring when he melts 
 i will have to talk to the driver 
 the truck fell into a very deep crevasse we werent able to save the equipment 
 thats the experiment dumping a guy into a frozen lake

 man thats far out hey the jets won 
 now this might get a bit technical but try and stay with me using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators called the internet i can access surveillance maps villian biographical information and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter 
 cool whats it do 
 i wanted to ask you how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of santas workshop we have been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years

 you get your money from your husband 
 what about me 
 this is for mama and the kids 
 drink your beer and dont get so excited 
 why do you ask so many questions what difference does it make how carlos and i feel feeling does not buy clothes and houses 
 i dont know  
 is he in love with you 
 nice fellow 
 mmmyes 
 good looking 
 nobody a boy who works in a grocery 
 whos carlos domwhatshisname 
 maybe i should just forget all about money forget about mamma and the kids and the rent huh marry some poor dope like oh like carlos dominguez and get fat and  
 why not if you like it  if thats what you really want 
 i cant understand that fancy talk you mean im a golddigger sure im a golddigger why not 
 when you marry champagne cloclo you cant trade it in for beer you are stuck with it 
 that depends how much money has he 
 my soninlaw what do you think of him 
 why not 
 is someone with you can i get you a drink 
 and my leopard maybe he hurt the first girl but no more 
 of course not charlie i never thought you did 
 now i know i didnt hurt nobody when i was drunk 
 thats just it charlie thats what im driving at you could do anything in that time 
 i dont know 
 but between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours what happens charlie 
 i sleep it off 
 then what do you do 
 and when you drink you get drunk 
 i drink 
 oh im only exploring your theory lets take a step further you drink dont you charlie 
 if a leopard didnt do it who did 
 you know not scared enough nothing to scare it 
 well charlie just why do you think your cat didnt kill the contreras girl 
 it dont look like a leopard to me 
 here is something that should interest charlie a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago they used it in ceremonies the jaguar in fact all the cat family were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites 
 thats the place i remember  my feet were so darn sore i couldnt make it and galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself 
 and here is three tree mesa and here i go out of the big arroyo 
 what arroyo  how did you get to it  
 north in an arroyo shot through the head  maybe week ago no good skin everything gone  
 where where did you find it 
 whats left of him 
 you found the leopard 
 two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met 
 i dont know i want him to lock me up 
 look charlie you didnt do it and you know you didnt 
 i want him to lock me up 
 what do you want to see him for 
 i dont know i want to see robles 
 no he wasnt kidding im sick claw women hurt little girls no 
 here have a cigarette he was only kidding 
 im sick 
 yes i was drunk mr manning 
 charlie wasnt drunk last night 
 no im serious about this 
 sure 
 but he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl 
 sure i like my leopards 
 up at the museum 
 wheres that man 
 lets get in your truck 
 sure 
 id like one of them to say it to you charlie id like to have you hear his side of it his reasons want to hear them 
 they dont say it to me 
 they all say the cat killed this second girl 
 that cat aint mean i feed him out of my own hand for six years why dont he kill me at night in the truck i let him out of the cage when i am falling asleep i hear him walking back and forth i go to sleep he dont hurt me 
 you really think so charlie 
 no sir that girl in the cemetery my cat didnt kill that girl i told you cats dont go around looking for trouble if that cats alive its out in the country hiding under a bush starving to death 
 look charlie just be patient i will fix everything you dont want that cat anyway it killed two people 
 cant make a buck without my leopard i tell you mr manning you gotta find that cat for me or pay up 
 tomorrow  
 see you tomorrow  
 maybe not cards mean different things different times 
 the death card 
 let me see it  
 dont look at it 
 go on  
 something black  something on its way to you  
 what are you doing that for 
 cut 
 the elderly man i told you about 
 who 
 well did he give you a lot of money 
 watch and see a day or a week but certainly this month you will have money from a man and then 
 you and your cards meet a rich man i look for them with money what rich man hasnt money and for what was i born if it wasnt for money you are not telling me anything 
 you will meet a rich man and he will give you money 
 what did they say before the bad card came up 
 all men are fools they like to make a big show  shout and hunt 
 they are fools why dont they let charlie howcome hunt it alone hes an indian 
 they buried teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again out in the country this time but they didnt get him 
 i saw teresa maybe i was the last to see her except perhaps her mamacita and her little brother i was going past 
 its a blackcard and bad card but not the card of the cat  not the card of fourfooted things 
 i suppose so i suppose it will be different for us too  when everyone knows then we will be just like other people but these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives 
 love is different for different people 
 when you are going to see pedro does your heart beat until you tremble 
 what senorita 
 rosita  i have wondered  
 pedro is waiting for me too 
 at four he will be there at four 
 you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your fathers grave 
 he will be waiting 
 i will miss you too honey 
 hey  im over here 
 oh dear i dont know what im going to do without you honestly i dont  
 i bet you try on my coffin some day i hope it fits just perfect 
 and if you have got cold feet honey ill take over for you that red dress of yours fits just perfect on me 
 i know i know you have got the talent i got the breaks 
 i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl 
 maybe for three years i have sung in rats nests while jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out trying to get me a real chance we are due for a little luck 
 you are lucky i wish hed front page for me 
 why not hes a good press agent and a good friend besides we have shared a lot of headaches  
 you think bes pretty nice dont you 
 yes so i have noticed jerrys noticed  he will come up with something 
 shes a local when the dudes come out to new mexico they went to wallow in latin glamour this is a bad town for blondes 
 it may sound like music to her i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower click  click  click 
 well now that you have had your history lesson i think i will get on to the museum 
 oh thats so interesting 
 its to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they wont ever forget that a peaceful village of indians was wiped out by the conquistadores back in the N th century a band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  thats what this procession is supposed to be 
 you know all about these things and i have lived here all my life  and i still dont know what the procession means 
 good evening 
 oh mr galbraith im so glad you are here 
 i didnt want to kill but i had to i heard her in the cemetery talking to the man in the auto 
 then you found the leopard 
 i couldnt rest  i couldnt sleep all i could see was teresa delgados body broken mangled i saw it day and night it was waiting everywhere i turned 
 tormented why 
 why do yo and ampi accuse me you dont know what you are doing you dont understand nobody understands 
 tell me 
 its better you dont know 
 consuelo screamed too and clo clo why did you do it why quick tell me why 
 i didnt do anything she screamed something frightened her 
 you shot the leopard we know that you killed consuelo you killed clo clo then tonight 
 not i tell you no 
 it was you 
 no 
 it was you galbraith 
 you have thought of all this before you know it isnt the leopard  dont you 
 no he would be a hard man to find jerry particularly if he were a clever men he would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him 
 couldnt you tell a man like that when you saw him 
 hed act normally when he was with other people it would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over 
 i dont mean that how would he act what would he do 
 to the eye like other men 
 if there were a man like that with a kink in his brain around here loose what would he be like 
 yes there have been men who kill for pleasure strange pleasure there was blue beard in france jack the ripper in london its not uncommon 
 all right the dead then in history there must have been men like that men with kinks in their brains 
 but all those fancy courses were about the dead jerry not the living 
 you know a lot you have taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff what kind of a man would kill like that 
 just barely possible yes 
 you must admit its possible that it might have been a man 
 some other time 
 dont you want to see the rest of the exhibit 
 come on charlie lets go find another and better suspect 
 you charlie you know leopards you might have had an old claw around somewhere and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage  eh 
 i dont know 
 yes but what sort of a man 
 a hunch thats all i have got about this leopard thing its just a hunch yet i feel it deep in the stomach it was a man 
 we had given up digging in a certain barrow i went back and i tried again i just had a hunch 
 but he would have to know about leopards have access to leopard claws and hair 
 some crazy guy 
 i can understand what you mean demented men pathological cases but what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard 
 there are all sorts of men you get to see some funny ones as a reporter 
 it could be why would a man kill her for what it wasnt robbery it wasnt a crime of jealousy or passion she had no enemies 
 it could be a man 
 charlie likes his leopard 
 charlie doesnt think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery 
 yes 
 about charlies leopard 
 charlie and i were talking thats one reason i wanted to see you 
 i will take you about got some nice things 
 more or less 
 come to look around 
 we are old friends 
 you know charlie howcome 
 i can understand about the cat killing the first girl charlie how come told me all that noise and those lights scared crazy it would do anything last night there was nothing to disturb it just a little girl alone in a cemetery 
 just a minute robles let him go on 
 caged animals are unpredictable they are like frustrated human beings i cant answer your question 
 but it doesnt eat what it kills 
 it doesnt know how to hunt its natural prey 
 why 
 jerry i talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard this leopard is another matter entirely a caged animal travelling around with charlie how come for years and years thats why it kills human beings 
 thats what i dont understand why should it come here and why didnt it stay here its got trees and bushes here outside nothing but cement and asphalt 
 sure certainly  but whats that got to do with this 
 it doesnt jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country  it wouldnt stay in the city  
 yes 
 doc something you said the other day 
 dont feel so concerned jerry 
 thats right of course 
 there is no danger at all its a wild animal do you think a wild animal prefers walls streets and people when it can get into open country 
 no im quite sure 
 you know about animals their habits will it come back 
 of course its the way any decent man would feel in your position 
 yes i want to go out and patrol the town be everywhere at once be sure nothing happens to anybody 
 you are worrying about its killing someone else 
 its about the leopard 
 i want to ask you something 
 well id best be off 
 yes its always fascinated me you know once when i was a youngster i went to see mrs leslie carter in zaza after the play i stood in the alley just to watch her come out 
 show business 
 no  really i can see them they are coming now  turn off the lights  
 wait  
 they do but there are no lights out there  they will just be shadows  
 i thought they came right past here  
 of course only im afraid you will be cheated there isnt much of a view of the procession here 
 miss walker i didnt expect anyone  
 i have disturbed you im sorry 
 thanks 
 im sure if you are as talented as you are charming miss walker you have nothing to worry about 
 well im next you wont hear anything like that mr galbraith im not a popular favorite since i let the leopard loose 
 that was a calamity 
 that was unfortunate 
 well im hardly mrs leslie carter whoever she was in fact im not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on jerrys little publicity stunt with the leopard 
 so you see meeting you is a real thrill for me 
 various reasons but i cant see why youd be interested in the rather dusty career of william galbraith  teacher naturalist curator when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself 
 why did you give up teaching 
 theres a little museum here in town they have hired me to run it we have some interesting exhibits of indian arts and crafts its fun and i like living here in new mexico 
 what do you do now 
 to know where that leopard went  im afraid youd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard i was a naturalist that hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards i used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back east i gave that up 
 jerry told me you were an expert with animals mr galbraith couldnt you tell where it went 
 offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit no im in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way come on charlie 
 you wont go to galbraith with me 
 yes and i am taking it to headquarters for examination 
 thats a fact isnt it 
 i am not interested in what somebody else thinks you being me facts and i will act on them 
 galbraith knows something he as good as said so  
 im sure of it 
 you think galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse 
 chief dont you understand what this means 
 ask kiki ask any woman girls dont put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark lonely street unless they are with a man or expecting a man 
 why 
 yes the lipstick 
 professional hunters who rid the state of cougars 
 state hunters 
 no he was kidding charlie 
 let me get one thing clear did galbraith make a direct accusation 
 i have been trying to tell him sheriff he wont listen to me 
 nothing much just that it might not be a cat this time 
 what are you getting at 
 i know all that chief and i dont like it any better than you do but theres something else 
 yes there is something wrong people who want publicity and dont mind how they get it what risks they make other people run what agony and sorrow they bring to other people 
 somethings wrong with this whole setup 
 thats why it just mauls and tears at them 
 its not for me im literally and figuratively a tenderfoot 
 go on foot 
 i havent done any posse work since last time i rode with toni mix at the old bijou theatre aged six if you are interested 
 thanks sheriff 
 you can go now manning there is no way we can hold you legally responsible 
 kiki galbraith said something to me once something you ought to know we were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves thats the way it was with us and we were too small to see it that way 
 its a lovely town  it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened 
 we ought to dare to tell each other everything kiki you and i 
 jerry i want you to be soft you are soft inside  where it matters i wanted it that day too but didnt dare tell you 
 i know what do you think i felt when you said dont be soft 
 i hated you that day  you and your flip talk  with that little girl lying dead 
 i know teresa  
 we stood here once before 
 its all right im not hurt 
 kiki 
 we will  
 no no thanks now we have got to do it ourselves 
 how do you know 
 half to the delgado family and half to cloclos family 
 all right im not ashamed of it i split it two ways  
 eloise doesnt own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check kicks 
 i i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise 
 what you cant be 
 as a matter of fact im out of cash myself 
 thats funny i never knew you to lose that much before 
 i got into a little crap game 
 didnt you take your cut out of the closing check 
 oh by the way im out of cash 
 im no detective i dont even know how to begin all i know is i want to do something about all this 
 you already know the answer to that i want this town to be safe and happy again 
 absolutely sure 
 you are positive of that arent you 
 kiki it wasnt the leopard 
 if thats being a softie there are two of us 
 confession im a complete softie i have been consciencestricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away 
 maybe there ought to be less racket and more us 
 im glad you care about us kicks sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket 
 you us 
 what else do you care about kicks 
 that doesnt make sense 
 maybe i want to feel badly 
 why do you want to stay around here it will only make you feel badly 
 robles says it looks that way belmonte had already been there and left they only missed each other by a few minutes 
 and she waited here for him 
 yes do you mind 
 you mean you want to take them to the cemetery 
 jerry these flowers arent really for me  
 yes 
 i know funerals 
 pretty you know its funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now 
 hes a nice guy vie ought to keep in touch with him 
 that was nice of mr galbraith 
 do they close up every year for this processionist business 
 i can use them 
 and not a sign of the leopard 
  as long as my feet held out 
 you remember the fellow this morning galbraith you have got time before the supper show 
 who is he 
 forget it im buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me a nice guy come along he will get a great kick out of meeting you 
 our first real break and we throw wild animals at the audience 
 the whole towns in a state kiki doors locked people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night  
 it must be the altitude  you bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys 
 and did you find the leopard 
 yeah 
 well does everybody love us now you have been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors 
 we all had to look at the body it was awful kiki awful 
 what did he have to do  look at the body 
 i dont know  a witness he seemed to know something about animals you know expert testimony 
 who was the other man 
 and i suppose you dont feel bad 
 i suppose he was trying to make me feel bad 
 dont be soft 
 suppose i slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses 
 now look what you have done 
 are you all right 
 the red dress no my black one then i will be just like him 
 you look swell in that threealarm number 
 i thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act 
 cloclo 
 and i never will you know whats between us  we are a thing but this is serious big competition 
 no  not yet 
 almost three years isnt it and have i ever done anything to hurt you 
 this is lN cant you subtract 
 look kicks how long have we known each other 
 you are too good to me 
 no i thought that might be just a little corny i want you to lead him in on a leash 
 on his back i suppose 
 i thought  is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life no not my favorite client shes going to make an entrance this town will never forget 
 thats easy me 
 listen kicks you will never guess what i have cooked up this time 
 makes no difference get him out 
 kiki he wont hurt you theres nothing to be afraid of 
 get it out of here 
 and i never will you know whats between us  we are a thing but this is serious competition 
 no  not yet 
 look kicks have i ever done anything to hurt you 
 you are too good to me 
 no i thought that might be just a little corny i want you to lead him in on a leash 
 on his back i suppose 
 i thought is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life no not my favorite client shes going to make an entrance this town will never forget 
 thats easy me 
 listen kicks you will never guess what i have cooked up this tine 
 makes no difference get him out 
 kiki he wont hurt you theres nothing to be afraid of 
 get it out of here 
 you a tourist 
 haha yeah what about that road back there though it says closed to the public doesnt it 
 maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the getty museum 
 nobody huh how come 
 aint nobody out there mister 
 all those soldiers out there getting bored thirsty come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps 
 must it 
 hot these roads all round here closed to the public whys that military bases huh i guess theres space enough for war games must be good for business 
 dial ooo on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink sir 
 mrs de moraes must have taken it hard eh her brothers death 
 no thank you ill be fine 
 you will have to ask mr de moraes that sir would you like a drink while you wait 
 you wouldnt recall if the brothersinlaw left together would you 
 i work here sir im here most of the time 
 by the way laurence were you here last time your mistresss brother came over you know just before he disappeared 
 mr de moraes is due back from brazil late this evening mrs de moraes is out and not expected before eight do you wish 
 when will they be back 
 im afraid they are out at the moment sir 
 could i speak to carlos or deborah 
 good afternoon de moraess residence 
 that would be mrs de moraes mother sir mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter 
 de moraes i was asked here by a mrs spitz 
 i am lawrence sir mr and mrs de moraes majordomo they are expecting you 
 that might depend on where youre going 
 will you please come with me 
 thats right 
 the dead can wait 
 i we have to bury leon tommorrow 
 you wouldnt understand 
 why the hell couldnt you divorce the man 
 your parents arranged the visit to my office 
 i dont know everyones dead 
 what do you suggest 
 on once once what are we you going to do 
 so you did talk about it huh 
 my parents flew back from israel told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce he flew back to brazil and his drowning was arranged 
 get to the point will you 
 the staff dont know yet i called my parents told them everything i just couldnt take any more 
 your flunkey said he was expected back tonight 
 they found his body yesterday in the pool at our house in sao paulo he drowned drank too much went for a swim and drowned 
 no not us 
 we you and your parents killed your husband 
 do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother 
 he he is dead my husband is dead call my parents theyll tell you call them 
 do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser deborah and then your brothers not buried yet as i said earlier an autopsy will 
 what are you doing you cant i 
 you know something ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time id hoped to have a private word with adonis but if thats the way you want it 
 perhaps i did until fear turned into panic thats when he hit me and told me hed killed my brother you dont know what youve done he said were in deep trouble he said we he said we wed both be killed if friedman ever found out you were working for us he said we had to stop you and friedman meeting 
 well i hope you enjoyed yourself 
 i didnt intend it that way it just happened he heard from laurence that youd been back that wed argued he asked why and it just happened i told him everything i couldnt help it wanted to see him scared i had never seen him scared before you see 
 to get me killed 
 my husband didnt need to slap me about mr lombard i volunteered 
 perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little 
 you seem to know what youre talking about 
 we all have to like what we become cowards included we achieve this by complicating things a little but its never that complicated really 
 should i 
 dont you believe in simplicity 
 simplify and damn 
 where is that 
 here we go again 
 what happened adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice 
 something like that 
 something like that 
 something like that 
 what was the idea husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed 
 i didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet mr lombard 
 a fright five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright 
 maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright 
 and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman 
 were turning in circles 
 are there truly no extenuating circumstances 
 you splendid bastard 
 five years of it surely youd have divorced him if he disgusted you 
 you bastard 
 rich young beautiful you must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids 
 why do i feel i neednt answer that 
 is there anything to understand 
 good 
 i dont 
 think what you like but dont presume to understand 
 one just doesnt tell me what does one speak about huh 
 i didnt know my husband and friedman knew each other i just do you think we spoke about it ive known for five years hes known ive known for five years but not once have we spoken about it there are things one just doesnt speak about 
 why did you send me after friedman to atone for your sins 
 that my brother my husband and your mr friedman were linked that much i had guessed but that my husband had killed leon no 
 you dont say 
 youre wrong about my being there though carlos borrowed my car that day his had broken down leon saw it like you assumed i was there thought hed wait to ask for a lift but carlos turned up with the tape you found leon got his lift and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out he watched it confronted carlos threatened to tell the police about the hotel i dont know how he knew about the hotel perhaps carlos talked too much my husband did not tell me you more or less guessed the rest i didnt know any of this before you left for los angeles 
 oh no at long last leon had found a mission hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned your husband killed your brother and thanks to you almost got me killed too 
 leon could still have hung himself 
 kids are not your thing deborah youd have been ready for me when i turned up with sleeping beauty damn it then too i should have paid more attention not leon you said it struck me at the time but obviously not hard enough you didnt say my god  or whatever else wellbred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved not leon who then you sure were right about one thing deborah the job was too formidable for me i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles but there i was focused so hard on friedman id stopped thinking nothing added up leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at N a go infiltrating the world of child traffickers duping friedman into selling him a little boy you sure were right the job was too formidable for me but you knew that didnt you 
 ifif my car is there i could be the one who why dont you accuse me of killing my brother 
 your brother stumbled upon adoniss little secret didnt he and traded his silence for a kid and some cash and adonis fell for it bought him his kid sent him away and then killed him when he came back for more leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints he came to extort a second kids life your flunkey let him in so his visit couldnt be concealed hence the exhibition story there was no exhibition just as you suspected remember deborah leon does his own prints wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art i should have paid more attention to your words perhaps its the way you say them 
 not in the strict sense of the word no he was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when i caught up with him later 
 youyou spoke to him 
 i doubt friedman ever even met leon deborah friedman dealt with select customers as for my envelope had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles 
 leon didnt hang himself deborah your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide how did he do it eh strangulation drugs no doubt an autopsy will tell 
 leon hung himself 
 leons not found your parents worry talk of hiring help to find him even mention their manhunter friends perhaps and adonis panics takes control brings me in reckoning a small time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward not before leons found anyhow he must have kicked himself when he learned id exceeded his expectations 
 leon hung himself 
 adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest didnt he seemed like a good idea an exjunkie obsessed with death the perfect candidate for suicide he just forgot one thing forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november an englishman might have thought of that but a brazilian 
 leon hung himself 
 does the name pierre dreyer mean anything to you hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband 
 my brother hung himself 
 what do you mean no mrs de moraes 
 no 
 tell me did he kill his little victims too 
 it must be tough being married to adonis to end up sleeping alone every night sleep must be hard coming whats harder the thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if or imagining what he does with his children 
 how when did you 
 i take it you learnt to live with yours then take it all the minddulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your wellbeing 
 huh dont you recall convincing me he had you should learn to live with your mistakes mr lombard there is some merit in it 
 you knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance didnt you 
 whatever the reason im sorry i did goodbye mr lombard i believe you know your way out 
 i guess the news youd sent me after friedman didnt go down too well eh 
 you do have a vivid imagination mr lombard i only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious i fail to understand your purpose in this still say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out all right 
 when did you learn about his taste for kids huh on your honeymoon or was it later when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother how did you find out did he confess try to convert you perhaps or was it womans intuition or just the way he fucked you 
 have you finished 
 you know hed have had him killed dont you does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind deborah or is it just cold expediency could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married 
 why i dont know what youre talking about 
 ive had a long and unpleasant day im tired and im angry but mad not yet i paid leons boy a visit this morning found him alive and well why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note eh 
 youre mad 
 how did you break into my office deborah ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips come on deborah acting dumb doesnt suit you who knew id found dirt on your brother huh who knew it was in an envelope taking me for dead whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands 
 you what mrs de moraes you what 
 you you are out of order mr lombard i 
 or is it the other way round the children are needed because you cant satisfy him 
 whats in the bag underwear to seduce your husband or is it for your own recreation tell me how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms is it because he does it with little children 
 sorry 
 black suits you 
 i if you dont mind i do not think he matters now it things turned out to be as we thought leon was weak theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore now will you please tell me how much we owe you 
 arent you curious to know about friedman 
 i well were burying leon tomorrow and look i wish i had more time but its late and with the funeral 
 youre repeating yourself mrs de moraes 
 im really sorry you were not called 
 why dont you ask when i left the mondrian 
 when did you get back 
 how are you mrs de moraes 
 mr lombard 
 uh wait a moment mrs de moraes 
 mr lombard mrs de moraes 
 yeah goodnight mrs de moraes 
 paul lamont 
 not yet the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address ill give it N hours he just might show up if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont paul lamont all right 
 yes you woke me up its the middle of the night here have you found mr friedman 
 are you all right 
 N have you have you found him yet 
 the mondrian room N the number is N N plus the la code 
 just a moment go ahead 
 have you got a pen 
 mr lombard 
 you do want me to keep the job dont you mrs de moraes 
 you drive a hard bargain mr lombard 
 wwhy are you telling me all this mr lombard 
 minimizes the risks children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses these can also be used to move women and drugs anything that makes money really 
 the hotels are useful capital investments the kids liquid assets my guess is they own hotels across the globe and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot 
 huh really hotels 
 you watched the tape friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes mrs de moraes theyre in the importexport business they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware houses and ports of call for their merchandise 
 are we understood 
 well i found a little more than that let me put it this way last night i thought your brother might be dead tonight im convinced he is that said i have no evidence and i advise you to let the police deal with it 
 im impressed that information could have cost me N 
 the man who sold the boy to your brother 
 who is friedman 
 you could say that and friedman left this morning for los angeles 
 you lost my money 
 last night you upset my sleep tonight my social life we have two minutes my dinner guests are waiting 
 thank you for coming come in and close the door will you 
 you drive a hard bargain 
 i still dont buy your story but i figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry besides if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner we could always get the right people onto you i trust you know who i am talking about 
 couldnt nazi hunters do the job 
 huh who do you think we are mr lombard 
 why me mrs de moraes why should such wellconnected people as you hire a small time french detective to look for their missing son mrs de moraes 
 the family hired you and i have just fired you mr lombard 
 i was hired by your parents mrs de moraes 
 laurence 
 no youre fired get out of my house and take your sick tape with you 
 perhaps i should come back when youre 
 get out of my house youre fired mr lombard 
 excuse me 
 no the question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here mr lombard 
 the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything mrs de moraes 
 how dare you you dont know this tape belongs to my brother do you mr lombard 
 look mrs de moraes however much of a let down it might be your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks impressionable as he is he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses tried moving on to bigger things came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table have a look at it mrs de moraes i told you i had bad news 
 oh no youll have to do better than that mr lombard 
 i cant tell you that yet but hes being well looked after 
 where is it he the boy you said my brother bought where is he 
 i will of course do my best to hang onto it 
 i need the money to smooth my way you understand now have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning 
 excuse me 
 your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place mrs de moraes and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise you dont mess around with child procurers right now my guess is hes either on the run held captive or dead i understand your misgivings mrs de moraes but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man which leads me to why im here at such a late hour i need N in cash by N this morning 
 what what are you talking about 
 you seem surprised could it be you dont think that badly of him after all you neednt worry it seems his motives were pure from what i can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse 
 theres more your brother also purchased a young boy for N 
 you you found that at leons 
 its a snuff movie prime paedophile material im told it retails at around N i see you dont require a definition 
 disney how inter 
 i found this at your brothers 
 anything is possible 
 can it be that you want your brother found 
 can it be that easy 
 now you are confusing me mrs de moraes 
 ohoh touch mr lombard but tell me what would you know about sisterly love eh no dont you might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear headed at least until youve done what we are paying you for 
 i dont know he seems to delight in so much sisterly love he might become determined 
 for your information mr lombard trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that 
 im afraid i have bad news mr de moraes i have reason to believe your brothers in trouble 
 i wont comment on the time but youll understand if i dont tell you to sit down now spare me the apology and get to the point will you mr lombard 
 was it cash mr de moraes the N you gave it to him in cash 
 perhaps it wasnt so brave of him had i been here i just might have given him his money mr lombard one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct as someone in your line of work ought to know 
 is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan 
 i have too much money to work mr lombard 
 what about you mrs de moraes 
 well leon does not need money for prints mr lombard does his own printing wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art which as he subsequently vanished raises the question what was the money for perish the thought 
 and that is the last time any 
 three weeks ago to borrow money i wasnt here but he got to my husband sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made carlos handed over N to get rid of him 
 that depends what youre looking at 
 appearances can be deceptive mrs de moraes 
 now you know why youre here mr lombard it might be difficult for someone like you to discern but we are people of a certain standing 
 can you tell me how you spell 
 penrhyndeudraeth north wales 
 a call box thats odd where exactly 
 theres nothing wrong with the line sir are you sure you have the right number N N is the number of a call box 
 N N N let me check it for you sir 
 yes im trying to reach a friend but i cant get through the number is N N N 
 directory enquiries can i help you 
 not in america sir you must be from europe so black coffee and a couple of crescents 
 the word for those things is croissants 
 croissants like that 
 im sorry sir could you try that again 
 croissants 
 crow what 
 a coffee and a couple of croissants 
 good morning sir how can i help you 
 huh and they say charitys only rewarded in heaven hallelujah christ 
 nothing sticks to slime emily this should cover what you lent me 
 i can the question is can you lie to your ex husband 
 you cannot walk away from this you cannot 
 theyd never let me go and youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me 
 my exhusband my work drove him away made his life a misery he thinks im obsessed punishing myself for what happened to our son but hes a good guy hell listen to you he wont turn you in if i ask him not to i can pretty much guarantee that okay 
 what about your friendly cop 
 im emily stewart the hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen yearold boy disappeared the pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat however i go about this thats who i am do you get what im fucking saying mr lombard 
 its up to you whether they walk or not 
 damn it you cant fucking walk away from this 
 look either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk for gods sake what am i supposed to say i got this from a french guy from england who broke in there to have a chat with an austrian child trafficker is that it 
 then find another way 
 a seminar in a baby breeding farm bodies in acid you think ill get anywhere with that jesus with luck i might raise a laugh they might even send a patrol car to check the place out whatever itll be too late 
 im finished here and im tired emily you shouldnt be here now dont make it worse 
 thatthat wont do thats not the way it goes you saw it you tell it thats the way 
 call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid can i have the keys to your house 
 do you know a friendly cop 
 were both thinking the same thing right 
 no one saw me but the italian and a dog i blew up their generator they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up 
 who knows who cares you wanted slime you got slime 
 italian the mafia 
 some italian i picked up back there hes in the boot of the mustang 
 so who whos the man where is he 
 friedmans dead they killed him 
 what some kind of organ factory pregnant girls doped up babies theres a lot of people back there theyre holding a seminar traffickings the past breeding the future 
 what 
 whos the guy whos the guy nom de dieu had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate id have had to kill him 
 look you dont tell me about some godforsaken place where stuff so bad even i couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep what happened whos the guy the austrian 
 i think so and if it comes to it tell the cops anything you think will make them move whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is bye now 
 have you found your man is that where he is 
 route N past edwards air force base and about half a mile before a place called the red mountain motel theres a dirt track with a closed to the public sign it leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere if you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry okay but not before you hear 
 oh what yeah okay 
 get a pen and dont ask any questions 
 burn the passport and keep the money think of it as a donation to the cause 
 what am i to do with the packages if 
 dont fall asleep with your hair wet 
 yeah goodnight emily 
 right well ill get your money first thing in the morning okay okay goodnight then 
 thank you but i think ill go to bed its been a long day 
 a little too tight eh they were my sons only thirteen and already six feet tall a real lanky boy i theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry 
 come on mr lombard you tailed your man all the way here from europe you told me you knew where to find him remember or didnt i hear you right 
 huh i have no hard evidence 
 did you not enter this country illegally 
 a criminal 
 its give and take time mr lombard you need help we need information you didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it did you 
 did you call me up here to enjoy yourself emily or to let me use your phone because we seem to have a slight problem 
 how come youre alive child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do what am i really looking at here huh are you really not just a lousy private eye am i really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise 
 thank you for the guided tour but would you mind telling me what were doing here 
 like youll find a way to stop your austrian killing you a second time round 
 im sure ill find a way 
 no answer you have no passport and your embassys out how do you plan to leave the us mr lombard 
 hah what about nathalie 
 a recent acquisition weve had four break ins this year alone files stolen computers wrecked faeces smeared on walls the good guys dismiss us as alarmist dogooders the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us an easy living indeed mr lombard i got through to moreau and jane i left your landlord out of it your flats been broken into jane wants you to call her back 
 i wouldnt mind thank you 
 thereve been N international treaties since N aimed at preventing child slavery but still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation officially its just not called for sit down can i offer you some coffee 
 i might come back i might not but if i do it wont be for a couple of hours 
 i know where to look 
 you know where to look for your austrian right

 there are over N million people in this city why me 
 lombard it will take a few days for the things i need to get here meanwhile id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog 
 have you never heard of collect calls mr 
 no a poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer he disappeared on his second shopping expedition 
 you dont know why hes come to los angeles the man you say he killed who was he a colleague of his 
 yeah 
 by your austrian 
 the mondrian room N i was checked out in my absence

 weve still got the italian 
 most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes mr lombard confused and frightened victims its all too easily discredited you understand now you might be just what weve been waiting for your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen 
 if you have hard evidence about a child trafficker we want it mr lombard and we want it before you get yourself killed 
 hi

 well i hope youre not too heartbroken and 
 oh we split up 
 its friday night jane what happened to your latest boyfriend 
 so you havent seen the film then 
 that are called rommel or something i guess not that many 
 i dont know how many famous french film directors can there be 
 should i 
 la collectionoose its about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her its on tv tonight and as im in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and the review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct and witty the directors supposed to be famous rommel or something french you must know him 
 la what 
 have you heard of a french film called la collectionoose 
 yes but my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company for expenses and all that you know itd cost you about N but he said itd be worth it of course youd need a partner to register but thats a formality i mean i could be your partner i mean just as a name right 
 good 
 must be your lucky day then ive got your accounts you dont owe much tax for last year 
 no 
 fine how was the match did you loose 
 how are you jane 
 hello again neighbour i didnt intrude did i 
 jah 
 look at it this way he might achieve everything your son never did 
 plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education 
 N a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy 
 fine one more thing mrs and mr spitz may i ask what is or was your occupation 
 my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel deborah will be here if you need anything before our return 
 ha no mr lombard his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate 
 why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography mrs spitz 
 we are aware of your rates mr lombard we will pay you double your rates plus expenses in return need i say it again we expect discretion and undivided attention 
 my rates 
 the N is on account 
 when im told he came here 
 im sure as far as you know when and where was your son last seen 
 the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about his address is in this envelope with leonards address keys and other things you might need 
 any friends 
 no and before you ask no hes not gay he has had girlfriends but nothing serious 
 i take it your son is not married mrs spitz 
 then why arent you asking the police to look for your son mrs spitz 
 he could indeed mr lombard but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it 
 so he could have decided to go on a trip 
 leonard does not hold a driving licence as for his passport i do not know where he keeps it 
 did you look for his passport driving licence 
 yesterday it all looked normal 
 i presume you checked your sons apartment 
 then you should not have sought an explanation 
 i didnt mean to imply you did mrs spitz 
 i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography mr lombard by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold so as you see i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account 
 check with your sons bank banks dont usually give out information about their customers 
 do what mr lombard 
 how did you do that mrs spitz 
 you wouldnt be here if i knew mr lombard what i do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks that enquiries to the police and london hospitals have borne no results and that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now 
 what do you think has happened to your son mrs spitz 
 leonard what my daughter is on about mr lombard is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian you might as well know that 
 i take it your son is called leon 
 what i can appreciate is insolence mr lombard 
 look mrs spitz i dont know to whom im indebted for the recommendation but im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references what i do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not i can be of help i hope you can appreciate that mrs spitz 
 good now as i trust you may have guessed we are looking for someone to work for us someone whose discretion can be relied upon someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment do you think you could be that person mr lombard 
 okay recommended 
 you may not and besides it is irrelevant 
 didnt you say i came recommended thats what i thought may i know by whom 
 must i speak to you in french 
 recommended 
 whatever you come recommended we 
 well i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning mrs spitz i wouldnt like to think id kept you waiting for nothing 
 what if it is 
 i hope its not too significant 
 lombard this is not a jewish name is it 
 may i ask if you are jewish mr lombard 
 may i 
 spitz we spoke on the telephone my husband my daughter deborah whose house this is my soninlaw carlos the gentleman is a business partner of his 
 good afternoon mrs 
 hohotel los angeles he 
 the hyatt whats that 
 hyatt friedmans at the hyatt 
 trying to say something martin 
 dying without ever reaching the top 
 what is 
 i told you the rabble its me huh its sad

 you must agree to be blindfolded just for the journey it might appear unseemly youre the paying customer but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement 
 ill be alone 
 will you be alone the merchandise is it just you or 
 questions can amount to revelations now id hate to think i was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross examination mr friedman led me to believe we had a deal do we 
 an austrian not much to go on is it 
 an austrian 
 and while visiting our fair city you an austrian 
 the ladys not a friend shes a whore someone at a special screening i attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an austrian here in london and not just movies 
 your lady friend did 
 i dont recollect mentioning a friend 
 the person who put us in touch seems to think so 
 have you 
 i gather weve done business with a friend of yours 
 should i come back in five minutes 
 five to three youre early 
 yes you wouldnt know where i could reach him we had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my paris gallery you see i really need to see him before i leave 
 im sorry 
 oh this is wed arranged to meet tonight and im due to return to paris tomorrow 
 no i meant he left as in no longer works here 
 left when i just come from his place and there was no one there a neighbour of his 
 leon no im afraid he left 
 no thank you could you tell me if leon spitz is here please 
 evening table for one 
 good you neednt worry about the austrian anymore hes dead ill be in touch 
 fine 
 hows the boy doing 
 he showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street 
 no in fact id seen him a couple of months earlier he was quite depressed his work wasnt getting anywhere he said he was going to try something new realism london in the nineties documentary stuff you know 
 you sure what about before he turned up with the boy 
 no 
 did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work 
 yes three thousand pounds i still 
 the money leon left for the boy was it cash 
 he apparently the hostility was all hers leon didnt it hurt him they used to be close their parents were in their forties when they were born you see and mostly away they grew up in a scottish mansion with old nannies and servants he our world was so old and cold we shone for one another leon used to say his sister cut him off after she got married he never understood why but thought it was because she had no children was bitter 
 did he ever refer to the hostility between them 
 er yes 
 ive been away did leon speak to you about his sister 
 the nineteenth how come you didnt know 
 whats the date 
 hed come prepared he had something besides shiva sleeping beauty the disney film well it looked like the disney film it was something else i couldnt watch 
 no sick people in the country huh just tell me one thing rhian leons story about the boy you just took his word for it 
 im sorry its just you dont look local 
 and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun if leons austrian was looking for you i reckon hed have found you before i did 
 oh i she just moved ive got her new its in my book in the kitchen wait thank you 
 i cant think of a good reason for it for now anyway my number if anything happens whats your sisters number 
 yesyouyoure not going to take shiva away 
 is she on the phone 
 my sister she lives in the next valley 
 who else knows about the boy 
 albert albert and ethel why 
 do you know leons parents names 
 theyre german jews came here before the war they both lost all their families in extermination camps but they themselves never went near one the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon its not guilt more of a curse and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions 
 im afraid i dont understand 
 yeah but he didnt beat the demons a quarter of all the shoes sold in europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire all started from a small shop in the east end of london and war reparation money for holocaust victims 
 his mother would be pleased to hear that 
 thats what he said i tried to dissuade him told him i couldnt take on another child that hed get into trouble i mean people who sell children but he wasnt listening i guess he finally found himself a crusade his family think hes back on drugs eh huh leon did drugs a lot of drugs went through his selfdestruct phase you know things to come to terms with demons to fight some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated not leons he did beat the drug though he did 
 good reasons 
 he just said he had good reasons 
 did leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved rhian 
 we didnt quite make it as lovers leon is a good man though 
 shut up 
 what are you going to do now call the police take him away i must warn you hes terrified of men so 
 youyoure wrong i just called to ask if i could stay with him next time im in london thats all 
 havent you then why the worried messages on his answering machine rhian id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble 
 you thought wrong i havent seen leon for months 
 well i obviously do and i also know that leons not here rhian but i thought that you might know where i should look for him 
 leons not here how did you get here phil doesnt know where i live 
 as you know from speaking to phil your friend leon has disappeared rhian his family have hired me to find him 
 no what do you want here how do you know me

 un autrichien negociant en pr pubescents 
 questce que tu veux 
 huh im a businessman what are you eh 
 dont tempt me the last scumbag who thought i might kill him died soon afterwards 
 what you gonna do kill me 
 shut up and walk 
 when they realise im missing 
 thats what he said 
 youre sure he said his caller was a man 
 two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the london hotels he didnt need your confession 
 what sums 
 some guy called to let him know the frenchman whod called the night before he left london was in la looking to kill him he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously 
 not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call 
 i can only tell you what he told us 
 try again and this time be polite 
 thats the beauty an anonymous call makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to eh frenchfuck 
 so you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room how did friedman say he got to know where to find me 
 huh maybe he figured the news our london bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well he only shared his guilty secret last night and then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk 
 i think youd rather not know what i think 
 what do you think huh 
 so why didnt he 
 if he had youd be dead 
 are you telling me friedman didnt tell you i was here looking for him 
 thats just it the sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues testa di cazzo hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you he hasnt gone to hell too soon and neither will you mr lamont 
 nice way to help a colleague in trouble 
 huh you turned him into a liability didnt you know 
 why did you kill him 
 let me give you a tip asshole no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in london and here tonight and hopes to get away with it it upsets people its wrong fucking wrong 
 why did you kill friedman 
 huh youve been around eh 
 the acid bath 
 youre the lantern man huh if you wanna see whats left of him 
 glucks dead you sonofabitch 
 three 
 fuck 
 five seconds then you die 
 figlio di puttana youre the french asshole who bumped off the london guys 
 gluck 
 who i dont know who the fuck youre talking about sunshine 
 okay shitbag im only going to ask you this once where is friedman 
 its a good guess 
 mossad 
 their last suspected kill occurred two years back though your spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group still id watch my step these people are wellconnected laurent former israeli prime minister etc the ladys also president of an international zionist organisation anyway you get the picture 
 are they still operative 
 it appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady german group of nazi hunters known as never forget over the years were talking about a dozen or so executiontype killings 
 they lost their son why 
 salut laurent ouais it wasnt easy but i got what you wanted through interpol say whats your business with these spitzes 
 moreau cest moi alors 
 sure but speak english will ya ha ha 
 very funny can i go on now 
 i dont know could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor huh 
 what do you think 
 whats that a word 
 costliest 
 cost what 
 ha ha yes with prices reaching an all time low the name of the game has become haveit whereitsat as we all know transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business 
 tremoille dont please 
 what do you fear most now my sword or his hands 
 no i see the hand of tremoille and regnault and yolande and you and they are dirty hands 
 jean me dear loyal jean why do you want to oppose the will of god jeanne wanted to go to compiegne we let her she got caught then on my personal orders regnault proposed N crowns for her ransom and once again the answer was no and now you say she tried to escape and the answer is still no jean open your eyes cant you see the hand of god in all this 
 but not impossible gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her 
 jean its its not so easy 
 we have to do something before she tries it again i beg of you my lord dont let her down let me organize an escape 
 its a miracle shes not dead 
 jeannes been badly injured she jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat 
 my dear aulon thats fine 
 N gold crowns 
 very generous of you all how much 
 here to help pay jeannes ransom all the captains gave what they could as well as the citizens of orleans and the other towns she saved 
 yes my lord 
 jeanne this is in fact my loyal friend and finest archer jean daulon jean i place her in your care find her suitable lodgings here in the castle and guard her with your life 
 so pretend its not a game 
 sire you know how bad i am at this sort of game 
 good until then feel free to live like a king 
 of course i am its just that 
 why are you not ready to die for your king 
 majesty i cant 
 my dear aulon to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood 
 my lord im not sure that 
 why not you jean daulon the only man whos poorer than i am and so the only man i can trust dignified honorable wise what more could we ask of a king 
 if she can find me thats a brilliant idea if shes really been sent by god she will discover the trap and if shes an assassin she will kill the wrong man bring her up 
 let someone else pretend to be you and see if 
 what do you mean 
 thats a good idea sire 
 oh dear why is life so complicated sometimes i really wish i could be someone else 
 jeanne you cant leave us like this 
 im not afraid of the fire anymore it will purify me 
 no you must come jeanne we need you so much has happened since you left i have a new horse now a white one just like yours and la hire hardly swears at all anymore you cant stay they will burn you 
 im staying jean 
 and maybe the king will give you some money and a little land and a title even wouldnt that be a fine thing you a lady of title 
 you dont know what you are saying you are going to leave this place jeanne you are going home or whatever you want you are going to be happy and have children and 
 one day you will 
 i i dont understand 
 my gentle captain im staying 
 yes yes any moment you are always so impatient 
 im already free 
 just give me a moment and then you will be free 
 i am ready now 
 thats an order 
 i want to stay with you 
 do as i say 
 but why whats the point 
 get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side 
 not yet 
 we must sound the retreat 
 it would not be the same without you 
 will you at least let me stay with you 
 if god wants me to win he will find a way and if he wants me to die if he wants me back then thats fine too then i will be with him forever 
 to be killed in battle 
 but it is what i want 
 but you have done so much for god as it is cant you do something for yourself for once for jeanne 
 i would like to marry you but i have already promised myself to god 
 jeanne i believe in you but can you believe in me for once dont go even if you dont want to marry me 
 jeanne i have been hearing voices and believe me those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne 
 i will ask my voices if they come back one day meanwhile im going to compiegne 
 to marry you 
 did you come back to marry me or to insult me 
 or maybe its jeanne whos in a trap her own trap a downward spiral that she cant stop 
 no but 
 did your voices tell you that you told me you hadnt heard them for months 
 its a trap they are buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england 
 he said that hes making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and 
 what did the king say 
 you listen to your voices i listen to my heart 
 thats not what i asked why do you want to marry me 
 tell the king to give me more men 
 tell me 
 if you really want to help me theres one thing you can do 
 jeanne i believe in you more than anyone 
 so even you dont believe in me anymore 
 me its not me its god who makes everything complicated if hes allpowerful why not let the english stay on their island in the first place and why let this war go on for a hundred years and why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family why why 
 the truth is always simple its you jean whos making things complicated 
 you make it sound so simple 
 i dont know it i feel it 
 but how do you know what you hear is the truth 
 all you have to do is stop talking and just listen 
 but i hear so many voices one voice saying one thing another voice saying the opposite love your enemy kill your enemy what is good what is evil 
 well of course they are me thats how god talks to me if you listen hard enough even you can hear him everyone can hear him 
 but how do you know that these these voices arent really just well you 
 its not time yet my mission is not over yet there is still more i must do before i can really finally go home 
 maybe their silence is a sign maybe its a sign to go home 
 its been weeks since they spoke to me since the coronation no signs nothing 
 what what do you mean 
 they have abandoned me like everyone 
 so what am i supposed to do now 
 jeanne the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore 
 because theres an arrow in your leg 
 yes yes im fine we need more brushwood why are you staring at me like that 
 jeanne are you alright 
 jeanne no 
 i will go 
 its over jeanne we won just as you said 
 yes 
 jeanne calm down do you hear me are you alright 
 come with me 
 well 
 the king said you are his finest archer 
 i promise 
 alright i promise to rest if you promise to go back to the battle 
 no its its nothing its 
 jeanne you have been badly wounded 
 not so easily why arent you fighting go on we are almost there 
 they have started the battle without me 
 whats going on 
 but to be honest i dont think they will leave tomorrow 
 good 
 uh they said they will think about it 
 what did they say 
 alright whatever but since hes not going to come down and cut it himself at least let someone cut it properly 
 how dare you tell me what god tells me to do 
 he didnt tell you to cut all your hair off 
 how dare you stop me doing gods will 
 jeanne stop it 
 theres nothing to hear i havent done anything and why havent i done anything because none of you will listen to me 
 jeanne calm down you cant blame the people they have been hearing all about you for weeks 
 who do they think i am 
 the king of england i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there 
 yes i am im an archer who can read and write who do you want to write to 
 i thought you were an archer 
 this i can do i was studying at the university of paris till the english invaded it 
 i also need someone who can read and write 
 well uh this might take a little time but let me see what i can do 
 better today than tomorrow 
 now 
 i shall also be needing a war horse mine is too slow and armor and a good sword and an artist to make me a banner 
 right raymond a priest 
 yes i didnt confess today 
 now 
 and i would like to see a priest 
 louis water and fresh straw 
 i would like some fresh straw 
 do you think i could have some water 
 listen please accept my apologies for you know me pretending to be the well it wasnt really my idea well yes it was my idea but 
 im fed up with taking her orders she swore shed defeat the english before nightfall instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed look at the mess we are in thats her mess not mine we are worse off then if shed never come at all now do as i say and sound the retreat 
 but that was her order 
 i made no such promise sound the retreat for the night 
 but i promised jeanne wed fight on 
 sound the retreat 
 we have to press home the attack 
 good 
 jeannes alive 
 no i i never killed anyone 
 so you were in the middle of the battlefield with your sword in your hand waving it above your head charging against the enemy screaming and yelling fighting for your life and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone 
 yes maybe i dont remember 
 you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air like this 
 no i i held it up to 
 did you use the sword that you held in your hand 
 yes but 
 so sometimes you were carrying just your sword 
 yes probably maybe 
 we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner 
 no i warned the english to go back home i begged them not to force us to fight they knew the defeat i would bring on them why didnt they listen to me 
 then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger too strong perhaps 
 no of course not i never killed anyone 
 are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner youd have killed more people 
 to avoid killing anyone 
 why 
 and so i i prefer my banner 
 and 
 no its just a sword is a weapon 
 and why was that did it have some particular value or power 
 i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword 
 which did you prefer your banner or your sword 
 yes 
 didnt you also carry a banner 
 quite a few 
 do you have a sword 
 i leave the answer to god 
 ah yes i forgot god sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission do you think that god made the right decision to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france 
 i cant read 
 that is not what is written in the evidence look for yourself 
 no i said surrender in the name of the king of france 
 and didnt you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven 
 i dont know 
 do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day 
 i dont remember maybe 
 it was on a sunday wasnt it 
 i tried to 
 is it true that you launched an attack on paris 
 i dont know but you are all men of the church why not ask him yourself 
 good advice for the french not for the english do you think god hates the english 
 go onto the next question 
 no but my revelations were for the king of france not for you 
 did god forbid you to tell the truth 
 no 
 you are afraid of displeasing god when telling the truth 
 i wont tell you more about that im more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you 
 performing a miracle 
 wwwhat are you doing 
 no no you dont understand this is no ordinary oil this is miraculous this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown king clovis in this very cathedral 
 thirty years ago im not surprised its gone 
 well at the coronation of king charles vi 
 and when was that 
 i dont understand the holy oil of clovis it was quite full the last time i saw it 
 oh yes my lady all true kings of france must first be anointed in our great cathedral of rheims with the holy oil of clovis for it was within these very walls that saint remy received the sacred oil from heaven brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of king clovis 
 it is the sacred place that matters charles not the size am i correct bishop 
 well find some other way be creative tell them she fucks the devil hmm not a bad idea why cant you say that sounds good to me and who can prove she doesnt 
 im on the side of our mother holy church besides a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt 
 whose side are you on cauchon 
 scared to make a mistake supposing shes right supposing she really has been sent by god 
 scared of a girl 
 you wont be able to drag anything from her that way you also must realize that many of my colleagues are well scared 
 well what are you waiting for you have got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys go and torture the bitch 
 but we cant do that unless she admits to blasphemy 
 and your prerogative is to find her guilty 
 it is not for us to burn her my lord that is your prerogative 
 so long as this bitch remains alive our armies refuse to fight dont you understand they want proof that god is on their side and the only way they are going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch 
 be patient my lord you have seen how it is this girl has a way with people but everyday we are making progress 
 how can i calm down when im made the laughingstock of the whole court i have had enough 
 calm down my lord i beg you 
 well then start proving or else the church will have another martyr 
 but in order to do so the church must first prove her heresy or else you will be burning a martyr 
 we want her burned as a witch 
 but if this trial seems fixed i fear you will have the very opposite result to the one you want 
 to hell with procedure we paid a bloody fortune for this slut and we can do whatever the hell we like with her whether the church likes it or not is that clear 
 i understand your impatience but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and 
 shes loyal to her king its only to be expected that she 
 whos running this trial you or her i cant believe it this wretched girl how dare she speak to us like that 
 rouen is in english territory i have the right to do anything i like take them away 
 what are you doing this is an ecclesiastical court you have no right to do this 
 arrest them 
 and god who allowed you to be caught 
 god defeated the english not me 
 your king ah yes of course whats he going to pay me with cows chickens i prefer gold and the english have plenty i wonder how much they will pay to have the witch of orleans in their clutches those english are so arrogant they cant accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl it has to have been the devils work 
 my king will pay any ransom you ask 
 guess 
 where where am i 
 dead you are worthless darling 
 am i am i dead 
 so here is the famous jeanne savior of orleans terror of the english you look pretty ordinary to me 
 i will be right here i promise 
 but where are you going to be 
 dont worry about me just stay in here and dont move 
 what about you 
 quick hide in here 
 i was talking to the priest and do you know what he said to me 
 really 
 i was so worried we have all been looking for you the english are everywhere o thank you lord 
 no no im fine really 
 are you alright did they hurt you 
 i i cant jeanne i cant hear your confession im sorry 
 i ask only one thing to hear me in confession 
 its not my body i want to save its my soul 
 i know jeanne it was the only way to save you from the fire 
 and you why did you lie you promised i could be confessed 
 i dont understand jeanne why did you do it why 
 silence her take her away 
 i didnt mean it i didnt know what i was signing you tricked me 
 you have nothing to regret 
 please may i have it back 
 as often as you like now please for the love of god sign 
 and may i go to mass 
 sign this and i will confess you myself if you want 
 no i want to be confessed 
 jeanne i beg of you sign in gods name dont you understand im trying to save you if you dont sign the english will burn you to death is that what you want 
 i am sent by god and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment or do you think that you are better judges than he is 
 it is for us to determine whether you are a good christian not you 
 so it is the church militant that refuses to confess me and so prevents me from being a good christian 
 let me clarify things for you jeanne on the one hand there is the church triumphant that is to say god his saints and the souls that are saved and then there is the church militant that is to say our holy father the pope the cardinals the prelates of the church the clergy and all good catholic christians moreover this church when assembled is guided by the holy spirit and therefore cannot be in error that is why we ask you to submit to the church militant that is to say us 
 is it here now in this room 
 yes 
 tell us jeanne do you often hear this voice 
 did it give you advice good advice 
 many things 
 what did it tell you 
 yes 
 the voice was in your cell 
 praying 
 what were you doing when the voice came 
 last night 
 when exactly a day a week when 
 not long ago 
 i assure you they do so answer me when was the last time you heard this voice 
 these questions have nothing to do with your trial 
 jeanne you are not helping yourself if you dont answer our questions properly your refusal will be taken into account 
 and you be careful you who claim to be my judges for you too will be judged one day 
 jeanne be careful you are not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment 
 not unless you hear my confession 
 jeanne listen to me very carefully we are all men of faith and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own we do so in the name of our holy mother church who never closes her arms to those who would return to her but we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority take heed of this charitable admonition for if you persist in refusing our help then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you so now will you please recite our lords prayer 
 not unless you hear my confession 
 recite the lords prayer 
 yes in the church at domremy 
 were you baptized 
 nineteen or thereabouts 
 how old are you 
 in a village called domremy 
 show us a little more cooperation first where were you born 
 my name is jeanne my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me i would like to have it back 
 so begin by telling us your name assuming you are allowed to tell us that much 
 i will willingly swear to tell you what i am allowed to tell you but as to the rest even if you threaten to cut off my head i still wont tell you 
 you must take the oath not even a king would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith 
 i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things but as for my revelations i have never told anyone except my king charles the seventh the one and only king of france 
 you will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked 
 i dont know what you are going to ask me questions about you may ask things that i wont want to answer 
 take the holy gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked 
 yes they paid your ransom tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at rouen 
 the english 
 it seems that the english care more about you than the french 
 but the king my king didnt he pay my ransom 
 your trial jeanne on a charge of heresy 
 trial what trial 
 pierre cauchon bishop of beauvais as you were captured in my diocese the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me 
 who are you 
 i will hear you but not now not here 
 oh thank you lord im so glad to see you i need to confess i havent been confessed since easter or been to mass will you hear me now 
 dont look at the cost look at what it brings what is your last offer 
 N but i heard king charles was financially embarrassed 
 i understand how much 
 this word is regrettably appropriate for the situation in fact what we the church wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by god as she claims you understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse gods name in this manner 
 buying her 
 not so well i regret to say this business with the maiden its caused him endless grief and torment thats why hes entrusted me with the task of shall we say 
 and your duke the duke of bedford 
 thanks be to god 
 hes feeling wonderful 
 good day sir i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well 
 then her faith will have to be bigger 
 but her armys so small now 
 dont worry charles if god is still with her she will be victorious we are not her judges we are just spectators let her go to compiegne as you let her go to orleans and let god decide her fate 
 i i cant stop her 
 i assure you charles the maiden has no greater admirer than myself but whatever our personal feelings we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war for the sake of the kingdom it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne 
 its true theres only one king people need to be reminded of that nevertheless jeanne has done so much for us 
 for the sake of france charles and for the sake of my grandson 
 you will 
 you are a fine judge of character charles it will take you less than five minutes to expose her if shes a fake but if shes not then she will give you your answers and place the crown on your head 
 you really think shes been sent by god 
 who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions 
 wwwhat has that got to do with this maiden 
 mmmm yes i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart i know how painful it is for you to have loved a father without ever knowing if he really was yours 
 you think 
 your health and happiness has always been my first concern charles ever since you were a little boy and i think i know you better than your own mother 
 why do you have to be so bloodthirsty do you enjoy it all that blood and noise and pain diplomacy is far more civilized far safer and far cheaper 
 peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance 
 well we are of course enormously grateful for your past efforts but your task is done now its time for negotiation and after many months of skillful work our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english you see my dear jeanne as it is written in the bible to everything there is a season a time for war and a time for peace 
 so how would you put it 
 gave you well now i wouldnt quite put it like that 
 why did you betray me paris was ours for the taking all i needed was another few hundred men why did you take back the army you gave me 
 now hold on you are not captain here on the battlefield perhaps but not in the royal bedchamber 
 get them out of here 
 and my crown doesnt fit and really 
 you look wonderful 
 ah jeanne come here this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco nothing is ready 
 orleans has held out for six months i dont suppose a few days will make much difference take some rest 
 i dont need lodgings if we are to be marching on orleans 
 he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god and he told me that i jeanne will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france 
 and what what did he say 
 i didnt wait long one day i was going to mass like i do every day when the same strange wind started blowing again 
 you did well 
 what was my mission to help my country but how could i do that i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it 
 i know you are not yet but you will be soon 
 im im not the king 
 theres no need to be afraid sire 
 noooo 
 i i dont know it will sound like we betrayed her 
 let them come let them see whos the true king of france 
 theres no time sire we cant hold up the ceremony theres no telling when the english might come back they are only ten leagues away 
 hes probably right lets call a delay 
 no doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause but what about the ordinary soldier they dont fight for causes these days they fight for money whos going to pay them 
 my captains have sworn their support 
 to ensure our privacy i need to talk to her alone 
 as always majesty 
 my dear loyal tremoille i know i can count on you 
 your majesty i really think you 
 tremoille im not even king yet whod want to assassinate me 
 supposing shes an assassin 
 my astrologers assure me that the hour is pppropitious leo with virgo rising have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the virgin is next to the lion 
 your majesty i urge you not to see this woman it all reeks of a burgundian trap 
 the other half 
 i can see her if i want to i mean with half of france in the hands of the english what have i got to lose 
 not exactly she wants you to give her an army at your expanse bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury i fail to see how you can afford such an adventure 
 if she comes from burgundy it makes a difference it might be a trap look signed x what sort of name is x or must we conclude that a messenger of god cant even write her own name 
 what difference does it make where she comes from 
 you mustnt see her my lord we know nothing about her we dont even know if she is from lorraine 
 she says she will be here tomorrow 
 she pretends shes been sent by god these charlatans its a pity there isnt enough wood to burn them all 
 thats enough you will answer the question or face the consequences 
 go on to the next question 
 but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel or a man how would you recognize him by what he said 
 im more interested in what he says not what he looks like 
 is it long and hanging down 
 yes 
 does he have hair 
 his face 
 you told us about the appearance of this voice what exactly did you see part of it or all of it 
 go and ask him yourself 
 then why did your king believe in you without any proof 
 if there was i didnt see it 
 when you saw your king for the first time was there an angel over his head 
 i must offer to the duke i will give you his answer tomorrow 
 N we cant raise more we can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity 
 N gold crowns 
 may i without offending you inquire how generous 
 i know but the english want her very badly and i have to tell you that they are proving much more generous 
 it is all his majesty can afford he has even donated his very own personal savings his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families 
 thats not a lot 
 N gold crowns 
 the english wont wait 
 not yet 
 well shall we go 
 the bridge wont wait 
 we need another ten minutes 
 stand by with the batteringrams 
 i know what im doing so either lend a hand or go back to bed 
 jeanne what are you doing with that you have got it back to front 
 we are taking back the tourelles 
 whats going on 
 the wind will be with us do as i say 
 the wind will be against us 
 position the longbows over there crossbows over there and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees 
 sooner is better than later 
 can we uh discuss this later 
 dunois was it you who ordered the attack answer me 
 knowing what i know enormous gratitude 
 jeanne put yourself in my shoes for a moment how would you feel if you were me 
 ah so thats it to you im just a girl 
 jeanne you have to understand its not easy for us i mean for our pride to suddenly be usurped by a well with all due respect by a girl 
 be patient be patient is that the only advice you can ever come up with i have shown more patience than a dozen saints 
 what complicated about it all you have to do is do what you are told what could be simpler than that im the drum on which god is beating out his message beating so loudly its bursting my ears but you are all so full of your own voices you are deaf to his 
 jeanne with respect we cant just attack the tourelles like that its a very complicated matter and 
 you know i feel a great sorrow for you because you are laughing now but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of god 
 god 
 jeanne that really makes no sense at all the tourelles is virtually impregnable besides if we are on the other side of the river attacking the tourelles whats to stop talbot attacking the city from the north 
 we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace if they refuse we recross the river and attack them here at the tourelles 
 so what is the message 
 fine go now if you want but not with me you may have a duty to god but i have a duty to my people and my people are starving so right now im going to take the food back to the city and if you can please calm down and let me accompany you to orleans it will be my honor to welcome you 
 you may have been with your counsel but i have been with mine and im telling you gods counsel is wiser than yours and hes telling me to speak to the english now 
 well id love to see that but after taking counsel with my captains i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything 
 because if they dont i will raise such a warcry against them that they will remember us forever 
 because because i mean the english have a broad sense of humor but i mean you dont understand to them you are a witch working for the devil what makes you think they will listen to you 
 for what 
 wait wait 
 hes on the other side of the river 
 good can you bring me to him 
 i know 
 its coming i rode on ahead i have to speak with the captain of the english army his names talbot 
 everywhere where is the food 
 good where are the english 
 yes they were 
 were you sent by lord dunois 
 as long as she brings food and supplies she will be welcome 
 but dont you think we should at least go and welcome her 
 xaintrailles dont talk to me about miracles if i was still sitting there waiting for a miracle id be dead now anyway 
 and its not the first one they say she saved a little boy who was dying of 
 yes its a miracle 
 the dauphin hes sending us food and supplies and an army led by jeanne the maiden from lorraine isnt it wonderful 
 calm yourself xaintrailles now slowly who has finally done what 
 my lord dunois i have wonderful news finally hes sending her to us thanks be to god we are saved its wonderful 
 no good this is a disaster 
 this is no good 
 good idea 
 yes we can pray 
 there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes 
 me too 
 i do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked 
 oh but i forgot it was a sunday that explains it gods day off 
 damn right 
 god why of course wed forgotten about him strange i dont seem to remember seeing him at agincourt 
 that will put fire in my soldiers 
 brilliant idea but to be really effective why not send a whole army of virgins 
 to hell with your voices its time to face facts we have nothing to do here none of us not even you you should go home jeanne 
 but my voices they promised me 
 he never sent them dont you understand he doesnt want this war anymore he has his crown now thats all he ever wanted 
 but where is dunois where are the men the king promised me 
 jeanne that is not ten thousand reinforcements that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers 
 of course i do bring them up 
 do you know how to count 
 never look behind only ahead 
 jeanne look behind you 
 right behind us dunois with another then thousand men 
 reinforcements where 
 so bring up the reinforcements 
 jeanne we are not enough 
 i know but so is the enemy they are falling back paris is ours 
 jeanne the men are exhausted 
 maybe i dont know but first we have to confess 
 bravo what about all the other hundreds of prisoners do we let them go too 
 i care and i care because god cares all life is precious to god even his even yours and mine 
 jeanne let him do it one more dead bodys not going to make any difference so who cares 
 for weeks you have been asking for this well now you have it 
 no not like this 
 you look disappointed isnt this what you wanted 
 perfectly 
 clear 
 the english are rebuilding it 
 but the bridge has been pulled down 
 we return to orleans across the bridge at the tourelles 
 i dont think i leave that to god im nothing in all this im just the messenger 
 and what does jeanne think 
 it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same why must you complicate what is so simple 
 but will you also submit to the decision of the church 
 i submit to our lord 
 so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man 
 it was just more convenient as i was among soldiers 
 you also cut your hair short like a man and in the bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man it proves your desire to deceive 
 the clothes are not important 
 who told you to wear mens clothes 
 oh perhaps someone pushed you then 
 no 
 and you didnt jump of your free will 
 yes but 
 you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge 
 i know but thats not the way things happened 
 do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created 
 thats now what i meant 
 how can you deny it when you just said id rather die than fall into the hands of the english 
 no 
 so when you jumped you wanted to kill yourself 
 no 
 did your voice tell you to jump 
 i had been sold to the english id rather die than fall into their hands 
 tell us jeanne why did you jump from the tower at beaurevoir 
 here take this instead 
 yeah 
 thats different i mean we were fighting for a for a cause 
 besides what about these 
 because because you just cant 
 why not he has good teeth 
 but you cant just kill a man for his teeth 
 nothing just taking his teeth 
 stop it what are you doing 
 we still believe in you jeanne if it were up to me id chase every goddamn englishman into the ocean but its not up to us anymore its up to the king 
 you dont believe me anymore 
 i said kneel 
 jeanne if you dont mind i will stay standing this armor its a nightmare to get back up 
 a few teeth thats the price of his life 
 jeanne the man hasnt been paid for six months thats his only reward let him take a few teeth 
 if you kill him you kill me 
 jeanne get up this is ridiculous 
 take mine instead here smash mine first 
 its not possible 
 the smell of victory jeanne mmmmmmm i love it 
 you call this glory all this this blood this smell of 
 won such a small word will never do this is victory jeanne this is glory 
 we won 
 not for long 
 whats the use the drawbridge is up 
 prepare these as batteringrams 
 id sooner die than use magic 
 physicians are a waste of time you will have more luck with this charm of mine it saved my life at agincourt 
 dont swear 
 i swear i will never swear again in my life if you save her life but im warning you if you let her die then you are the biggest 
 were the men confessed where are the priests 
 god knows but it was a bad idea 
 what happened who gave the order to attack 
 they will and so will you if you go on swearing like that 
 jesus christ the goddamn english will pay for this 
 then lord dunois show me the way to the other side of the river 
 jeanne let me introduce the kings half brother the dogged lord dunois 
 sorry jeanne did you both meet already 
 la hire im warning you dont swear 
 hey my friend im glad to see your ugly damn face again 
 so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river 
 and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god wouldnt you say 
 still pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldnt you say 
 yes i was given a few but i never had time to wear them 
 what about all those dresses you were given silk dresses werent they 
 no 
 as much as for a lord what an honor did your king give you other wealth apart from horses 
 five steeds and a few hackneys 
 how many did he give you 
 my king 
 who gave you that horse 
 yes a halfsteed white 
 when you were taken prisoner at compiegne did you have a horse 
 lets see 
 yes my lord 
 you think you are ready now 
 no 
 you know what you just signed jeanne you just signed away my existence for you im a lie an illusion you see in the end you were the one who abandoned me 
 to love your enemy as much as you love yourself 
 yes 
 are you willing to follow all his commandments 
 yes i am 
 do you think you are ready 
 theres nothing for me to do here anymore i dont belong here i want to be with him now 
 are you sent by god 
 yes of course when you dont need me anymore 
 are you going to leave me too 
 i dont think so 
 my voices my voices do you think they will ever come back 
 good but love your enemies body and soul 
 love your enemies 
 no i 
 do you think this cross will protect you 
 because because i dont know what else to do to please him 
 what for 
 im trying to make my cross look more beautiful 
 what are you doing on the wall 
 i i cleaned up my room look and i said my prayers all of them and 
 really 
 i never took pleasure in hurting anyone 
 ah pleasure thats a difficult word to define when does the pain end and the pleasure begin when did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand 
 why are you doing this to me do you get pleasure from hurting me 
 i dont agree why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time 
 i agree 
 no i do not think so i dont think that killing each other will ever bring peace 
 no no you did fine id even say well done besides most of the ones you killed probably deserved it dont you think 
 i i was defending myself as best i could everyone has the right to defend themselves dont they or should i have let myself be killed 
 let all who love me follow me where does god get mentioned come on jeanne be honest you fought for yourself in your name 
 really 
 yes we fought and killed in his name the king of heaven 
 in his name 
 no but why didnt he stop it or did he get pleasure watching us killing each other in his name 
 is he the one who spread all this blood and misery 
 yes yes and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place if hes so powerful he said hes the creator of heaven and earth the source of all life he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery why didnt he 
 so your memorys coming back 
 stop stop i cant remember the battles were all so confusing there was so much smoke dust noise i was being attacked on all sides so maybe perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself 
 oh no how about this one 
 no i dont want to know anymore leave me alone i didnt kill that man 
 oh you cant remember let me help your memory 
 im not lying i i cant remember leave me alone 
 true every event has an infinite number of causes but why pick one rather than another there are many ways a sword might find itself in a field 
 but it didnt just get there by itself 
 no that was a sword in a field 
 like like the wind and the clouds and the bells and what about that sword lying in the field that was a sign 
 what signs 
 no but he sent me so many signs 
 you mean god said i need you jeanne 
 yes lots of things 
 god asked you to do something 
 because because i have always been faithful to god and i have followed everything he said and i have done everything he asked me 
 why would they 
 what do you mean they wont come 
 they wont come anyway 
 because i have to be alone 
 why not 
 no no you cant stay or they wont come 
 i want to see that do you mind if i stay on the side i wont bother you 
 yes thats what i pray for 
 they are going to come and visit you in here 
 my visions 
 who 
 yes 
 why are you waiting for someone else 
 what are you doing here please leave you cant stay here 
 why were you yelling like that 
 i told you already im here to set you free 
 i dont understand what do you want from me 
 oh so you dont want war anymore you want to be at peace you want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it 
 i dont know i dont care anymore i just want to be at peace 
 oh and just because you realize now everybody else should forgive you 
 no no im just so tired and lost and i didnt realize what i was doing 
 thats too easy one minute you want to die the next you want to live do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you dont want it anymore 
 how can you pretend that you love god when you are about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you life is a gift you should know that by now jeanne a gift from god you know what hed say to you if he was here what are you doing to me jeanne 
 i am true to my lord the king of heaven he knows how much i love him thats all that matters to me 
 if you were true to yourself if your faith was firm you wouldnt need to run away from yourself like this 
 i i never lied 
 you will be dead soon enough anyway so why be in such a hurry why not face up to your lies its your lies you cant stand anymore 
 everything prison humiliation being abandoned and betrayed by everyone i cant stand it anymore id rather die 
 and what exactly is it that you cant take anymore of 
 i im leaving i cant take anymore 
 i might ask you the same question 
 what are you doing out here 
 nothing im here to set you free 
 i dont know what do you want from me 
 who are you to decide if you should live or die 
 i dont know please tell me im dead 
 you think god isnt big enough to deliver his own messages 
 i dont know i thought 
 no no im just a messenger he needs me a higher calling 
 who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil are you god 
 i am that i am you dont like my face maybe you prefer this one 
 who who are you 
 i i i 
 what have you done to me 
 playing 
 jeanne what are you doing 
 i want to be at one with him now 
 soon you will be able to take the holy mass and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood you will be at one with him 
 i want to be with him always 
 jeanne be patient 
 i dont want to wait for his call 
 jeanne calm down calm down jeanne 
 then what will and what will bring her back and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me why didnt he take my life instead of hers it was my fault i was late she gave me her hiding place 
 i realize your anger jeanne but we must learn to forgive its hard but revenge will never bring about peace 
 i know jesus says to love our enemies but i cant i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever 
 only god knows the answer to that 
 why did she have to die 
 i heard about your sister and i understand your pain 
 perhaps but wherever he comes from i think you should listen to him because it sounds like hes giving you very good advice 
 he says he says i must be good and help everyone and take care of myself do you think hes coming from the sky 
 and what does he say to you 
 beautiful 
 what does he look like 
 he never says his name 
 who is this he 
 well i try and talk to him but mostly hes the one who does the talking 
 him 
 i feel safe here and its where i can talk to him 
 then why are you here so often 
 yes it is 
 so everything sounds wonderful 
 oh yes i play with them lots 
 and what about your other friends you dont like playing with them

 ohh no it makes my skin creep 
 yes like a cave 
 ohhh its so dark its like a dank cave 
 oh yes dear too terrible awful 
 to be deaf 
 i cant imagine a fate worse than being dumb turn around 
 it will be very dramatic 
 well you stopped combing your hair which is a good thing it was looking over done you see these are the slits that the heads will go through show him nessie they will be dead the reverend is going to use animal blood no doubt it will be very dramatic tea 
 watch his hand 
 careful watch his hand 
 watch your feet 
 watch your feet 
 well he has nothing to pack but he is leaving and it is just as well nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him we have had some tears 
 baines is packing up 
 he is quite altered as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone 
 that is good yes 
 how are the lessons going ada nods enthusiastically hes getting on all right ada nods again good 
 certainly there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent 
 and with time she will im sure become affectionate

 oh yes yes of course a concern 
 well she was very violent with the gown she tore off a chunk of lace if hadnt been there id have sworn shed used her teeth

 like it were a piano 
 what would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano 
 yes its unholy 
 well that is a strong opinion 
 ohhh dear not another word from the shock yes it would be 
 one day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest a great storm blew up out of nowhere but so passionate was their singing that they did not notice nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch and at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb she neverspokeanotherword

 mothers set her heart on a big church wedding 
 dad this is what i really wanted to ask you 
 you see how much we have to say 
 he will still be your soninlaw 
 take a good look at him dad now please try to remember him cause hes going to be your son inlaw 
 forgive me how are you 
 its been the same one for three months 
 yes yes 
 must have been in the war that might account for the cane and his limp 
 shrapnel 
 im very interested in that body 
 not at all 
 do you mind if i come down and see it 
 yes 
 going to run him through the fluoroscope 
 you can take that out to the car 
 know but i saw him 
 what are you talking about gilbert you werent there 
 i saw him too he was wearing a green suit with a white tie 
 children will you go into the next room i want to talk to chris alone 
 well i have got my alibi i was at the public library where were you 
 i hope you wont talk that way to the police when they come here 
 why not you had a perfectly good motive 
 gilbert 
 did you kill her 
 was there much blood 
 not a thing 
 did they find any clues a gun or fingerprints or anything 
 she could tell you where father is 
 that woman 
 he said that fathers in town hes been seeing julia right along 
 what is it gilbert tell mother what did he say 
 you see hed been very clever everybody even our astute friend guild thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer but our hero had just one weak link in his chain the telegrams wires and telephones were all very well but no one had seen wynant so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is mimi who was it that told you to say youd seen wynant 
 shut up 
 was wynants 
 you mean that body 
 because i found out for certain that he didnt commit the murders 
 why didnt you tell me why didnt you hold him 
 no 
 are you kidding 
 i will take care of him 
 what are you doing here 
 just the same wynant wouldnt mind having him out of the way would he how long should you say this bodyd been here doc 
 yes but we figured it was just blackmail 
 he said wynant tried to steal an invention 
 i never saw him i dont think anyone saw him 
 could this be him 
 rosebreen 
 dwr that case you worked on the guy who threatened to kill wynant what what was his name 
 extraordinarily lucky 
 lucky thing for us they werent in that lime 
 just rolled them up and threw them in 
 this is enough for me 
 fifty will still get you a hundred 
 i guess that cinches it eh mr charles he killed them both julia wolf and nunheim 
 shes ready to talk it wont do any harm though to find out where he is 
 get anything 
 nunheim 
 trail him trail who 
 im calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him i want to see where he goes 
 who are you calling 
 i think we are on the right track 
 well whatd you think 
 lets go and see taxi 
 hes holding out on you 
 no 
 did you know he was hanging around julia 
 oh hes all right we know all about him he does a little stooling for us every once in a while 
 what about this nunheim 
 i will check on that im afraid this is kinder dull for you 
 what about jorgensen 
 they are all ok mrs jorgensen the boy dorothy macaulay even morelli we had to let him go 
 i havent got that far yet but i dont think that everything points to wynant what about the alibis 
 whos your candidate 
 for one thing he was too absent minded to hold a grudge 
 what do you mean 
 fifty will get you a hundred that he didnt do it 
 nothing yet to cinch it 
 no proof 
 yeah couldnt find a thing this is the way we figure it wynant goes to julias apartment he finds morelli there sees shes two timing him they have a fight but he figures he dont want to do anything then morelli might squeal so he goes away he dont let his lawyer know anything has happened he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him so that julia will think its all blown over then when she dont expect it he lets her have it 
 you have been there 
 i thought it might be from now on they are going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is wynant 
 oh thats a phoney the men didnt even have to go down 
 what about the suicide 
 its a bargain then anything you want to know 
 so would i 
 man to man im not 
 man to man mr charles are you working on this case 
 that aint a gun any more the firing pins busted the dont waste time talking about that 
 you mean about that gun 
 you oughtnt to play this trick on me running out when i was giving you time to rest up before i asked you those questions 
 okay theres plenty of time i guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on we will come up tomorrow when you are feeling better come on 
 i will have to try to remember 
 whos is it 
 no 
 this gun yours 
 ever heard of the sullivan act 
 no 
 have you got a pistol permit 
 so you say go on bob 
 not without a warrant 
 keep on asking 
 im asking you 
 ask him i dont know 
 whatd he think it was to you 
 nothing 
 whats that to you 
 wanted to tell me he didnt kill julia wolf 
 whats he want of you 
 i never saw him before 
 we were looking for this bird 
 yes i might not have been shot 
 we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family so we figure we will stick around in case the old man himself shows up then we seen him sneak in and we decide to come up and pretty lucky for you 
 howd you people happen to pop in 
 well thanks we will call you when we need you again 
 i didnt know they had a fight 
 do you know what they fought about that night he went away 
 i know he will turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers you cant think he had anything to do with it mr guild he wasnt the kind of man that 
 yes but he didnt show up 
 did you go 
 about three 
 when was that 
 i wasnt in my secretary took the message he left word for me to meet him at the plaza 
 he did 
 he telephoned me today 
 well what 
 well 
 oh then you did hear from him 
 i said he hadnt written me 
 seen any signs of it bill 
 yesterday i gave her a thousand dollars 
 when was the last time you gave her money for wynant 
 let him have his say out 
 thats ridiculous 
 tell em 
 a brown suit brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red or reddish brown figures on it 
 what kind of clothes was he wearing 
 thats nothing i saw him myself 
 you did 
 goodbye 
 goodbye 
 thats all right well we will be going 
 the medical examiner seems to think that the body was touched he says it looks as if the girls hand had been forced open after she was killed 
 i dont think so of course i was terribly upset i hardly knew what i was doing 
 are you sure you didnt leave the room that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone 
 no 
 did you see anything in miss wolfes hand 
 why yes 
 you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it til we came 
 i see 
 there are a few things we want to check up on 
 you are a great help to a hostess i wish i always had you for my dinner parties 
 they will be here dont worry my men are picking them up 
 mr guild means guests oh there are two more to come 
 i guess all the suspects are here 
 i think we may as well sit down 
 looks like he planned something he shut up his apartment and his shop 
 do you think that wynant did it 
 i dont mind telling you id rather have you working with us than against us 
 but hes interested 
 good morning lieutenant sorry 
 good morning 
 just give me a minute i will remember im not stalling lieutenant you know i always come clean with you gee itd serve me right if you had pinched me thats the afternoon i was wait i will show you

 oh he as clever about that he called when you were out that same afternoon julia telephoned to him she said that you were coming mimi to ask about wynant he got terrified he was afraid that julia would break down and tell so he went to julia and killed her and left wynants watch chain in her hand 
 but it must have been wynant i should have known if it werent his voice 
 hello where in allentown yes when is the next train right i will get that wynants tried to commit suicide they want me to come down and identify him i guess this changes the whole story doesnt it that looks like an admission of guilt and i had such hopes i thought if you got on the case youd be able to clear him i thought that mimi the way she acted i was sure that oh well well its no use thinking of it now im sorry to have wasted so much of your time 
 hello oh just a minute police department 
 i have done that already he should appear you know it doesnt look well his staying away at a time like this 
 it wouldnt hurt to put it in 
 he gave me a code message to insert in the times in case i wanted to get in touch with him 
 it might 
 slim 
 what are the chances of getting you to do what he wants 
 thats all right 
 i hate to bother you when you are laid up 
 how are you 
 slong 
 how do you do what did you say he is where is he very well hes back in town wynant thank heaven hes waiting for me now forgive me mrs charles but i have been so upset its no joke working for a man like that i must be off goodbye goodbye 
 my wife 
 he sends word through julia wolf when he wants money i give it to her and she gives it to him 
 no word at all 
 you know as much about it as i do i havent seen him in three months 
 whats all the fuss about is he in hiding 
 i see i see 
 my wifes father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things and im looking after them 
 you dont say 
 i havent been a detective for four years 
 she usually is trying one way or another to get money out of wynant i wanted to find out if you were er er sleuthing for her 
 mimi oh dorothys mother does she have to be up to something 
 nothing thank you nothing i wanted to see you whats mimi up to charles 
 thats all right what are you drinking 
 dorothy told me you were here i was going to telephone but 
 hello macaulay come in 
 how are you 
 macaulay you drew up wynants will mimi was cut off wasnt she if she remarried 
 im lot going to stay here to be insulted 
 you are lying mimi but then youd do anything for money you are getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you wont get anything if hes dead 
 it isnt a story its true i did see wynant hes not dead 
 what did he pay you mimi to stick to that story 
 nobody told me i did see him 
 and the murderer is right here in this room tonight hes sitting at this table you may serve the fish 
 perfectly absurd 
 so i did i saw him lying buried in his shop 
 because i dont believe that clydes dead why you said yourself you saw him last night 
 he didnt say very much wanted to know how i was and how the children were 
 oh did he what did he say 
 last night he came to see me at my apartment 
 you did where 
 i have got some very important news i have seen wynant 
 this is all very pleasant but why are here 
 all right then i will tell them who did do it 
 they will want more than your word for that 
 i tell you he didnt do it 
 thats not for you to decide everybodys under suspicion especially running off like this the police will want his description is this a picture of him 
 but he has nothing to do with it 
 you should have told them hed disappeared 
 chris may be at the club or somewhere i dont see that its important 
 gilbert is he here too we might as well be living in the lobby 
 wheres gilbert 
 yes 
 dorothy is she here 
 i tell you again i dont want any part of it now you take dorothy home and 
 but he knows you all you have to do is get in touch with him and tell him that mimi says everything is all right but that i have got to see him 
 now mimi there are a thousand detectives in new york hire one of them 
 nick you will help me find clyde wont you 
 you are always teasing 
 well dont you 
 oh i know he didnt but i wish i could find him i have something very important to tell him macaulay wont help at all he thinks i just want money 
 what do you think 
 clyde wynants crazy absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this no wonder the police think he has something to do with it 
 want to talk to you about something very important 
 hello mimi 
 oh nick nick 
 i hope you wont let this news spoil your dinner nice food isnt it 
 what am i the fall guy 
 thank you now i will tell you why i know wynant didnt commit those murders three months ago the night that he caught you in julias apartment he found out that julia was cheating him and was splitting with some man he went to find the man that man was tanner dont you 
 once i wanted five grand cash 
 why do you say that 
 she dont say she is but i figure she is 
 morelli you knew julia was she gypping wynant 
 this is your party 
 whats that 
 i am on the level if i knew anything id 
 thatd be very smart thatd be the smartest thing i ever did me that a police captains been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument the boys would like to have me come in and ask questions theyd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks now i come to you on the level studsy says you are on the level be on the level 
 id tell you if i knew but im not in this ask the police 
 hes all right hed like to see you but listen whats the law doing to me do they think i did it or is it just something else to pin on me 
 how is studsy i didnt know he was out of stir 
 listen studsy burke told me you used to be ok thats why im here do they 
 thats all swell only you are peddling your fish in the wrong market i have got nothing to do with it 
 i wouldnt have any reason to hurt her she was always on the up and up with me but that dirty little nunheim he got sore cause i clicked with her and he didnt so he put the finger on me 
 why tell me 
 i havent seen her in three months we were all washed up 
 all right you didnt 
 i didnt knock julia off 
 i have never heard about you 
 do you mind putting that gun away my wife doesnt care but im in a delicate condition 
 i gotta talk to you i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight get me 
 his plan was still working beautifully wynant was established as being in town the watch chain was handed over with a slight delayto the police the only hitch was a man named nunheim who had found out something our hero paid nunheim once to keep his mouth shut and when nunheim threatened him again he bumped him off 
 i hope you are well 
 its the only way it makes sense 
 why are you saying it 
 i dont know 
 is that true 
 after our hero had killed wynant he got a brilliant idea he realized that he and julia could still collect money wynant was supposed to be on a trip no one knew where so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay signing wynants name so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia he even telephoned macaulay do you remember the first day that you came to see me he telephoned that he was in town 
 if that knife is missing i will look for it in your back 
 lets see where was i oh yes he went to find the man that man was desperate he knew that he was caught dead to rights and with prison staring him in the face he took the only way out he killed wynant its terrible to tell you this way but your fathers dead dorothy 
 you are going to drive me crazy 
 im afraid you are lying mimi you see i really did see wynant last night 
 serve the nuts i mean serve the guests the nuts 
 i wish youd tell me 
 i wish youd tell me who 
 yes 
 i cant wait any longer tell me do you think one of them did it

 but the poor kids going crazy shed rather know her father was dead than that 
 hey hey dont do that 
 im going to tell her 
 no nobody but you 
 wynant dead does dorothy know 
 smart gal 
 then he couldnt have committed those other murders 
 couple of months anyway 
 how long has he been dead 
 i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin it often bothered him so i looked for it and i found it gimme 
 you dont get another swallow til you really open up 
 sure 
 well dont they 
 oh well the clothes for instance they were carefully preserved and the body was just as carefully destroyed the person who killed him counted on one thing that all skeletons look alike 
 what things made you so sure 
 huh 
 nick you will drive me crazy what things 
 several things hello fred we are hungry again yeah and lots of onions oh and coffee 
 what makes you so sure its wynants body 
 thats what they think guild and all of them they take it for granted that its just another of wynants victims guilds hotfooting it around now looking for wynant thats all that troubles him 
 but they all said it was rosebreens 
 yup dont you want something to eat 
 wynants body

 please i beg of you the american army is there i am iraqi they will kill me 
 turn the car around 
 this road it leads straight to kuwait 
 whats in the other direction 
 baghdad 
 where were you going 
 yyes 
 you speak english do you speak english 
 its like i said you dont really know lieutenant john epps very well do you 
 looks like at the end of the day we finally find out whos better than who dont we epps like i said i expected more from you 
 if i give it to you will you let us go 
 give it to me 
 if i dont answer he will know somethings up 
 so you can give us away 
 i have to answer him 
 just keep quiet 
 you dont know john epps very well do you 
 they will kill you you wont make it ten feet before they cut you down 
 thats just what things came to sometimes you cant help that it doesnt change me respecting you and now you let me down i expected more from you you know i really did i expected you to 
 that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert 
 you disappoint me epps always figured you to be a man a real bright guy i had respect for you 
 tell me something wes are you crazy greedy or just stupid jaeger says you are crazy 
 thanks for taking care of this for me 
 look i know you guys are telling the truth its just the shiites dont know that i guess you could tell thembut then you dont speak the language do you 
 wes 
 sure and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with 
 wes we thought you were dead and we thought we were next hanging around to get killed wouldnt have done anyone any good 
 we thought 
 in the flack jacket still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat took the air right out of me but i was just unconscious for awhile course you didnt stick around to find that out you left me for dead 
 nothing about him unless hes got a problem about me dealing with you 
 what about jaeger 
 then i suppose itd be insurrection and i suppose id have to kill you i suppose 
 suppose i dont go for that 
 im the ones got the big stick 
 and let me guess who is 
 without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge 
 lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand 
 no navicom a lot of good you are now epps 
 what if i do 
 we been down this road i told you how it is unless you feel like theres something you want to do about it 
 in the service you do but we are not particularly in the service right now way i see it what we are doing that doesnt particularly give you the right to toss orders around 
 i out rank you thats why 
 you have got an awful lot of orders in you always giving orders 
 get out of my way 
 no 
 then step aside 
 its murder and i wont be any part of it 
 its a combat action 
 i have got no stomach for murder 
 im not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you dont have the stomach to do what has to be done 
 he tried to kill us if not just now then in the helicopter thats all the authority i need 
 we are not at war you and i and jaeger are awol we have no authority 
 we are at war 
 im not going to let you kill him 
 hes an enemy soldier 
 you are out of your mind 
 you dont know he isnt 
 you dont know that 
 thats what he says he could be a spy or something 
 you said he was a deserter 
 we cant just leave him he will run back to his outfit report our position 
 doesnt matter whatever he wanted he didnt get it we have got no need staying around here its light enough lets pack up and head out 
 i dont care what he says he wanted our gold would have slit our throats if he had the chance 
 hehe could have been watching us 
 hows he going to want the gold he couldnt even know we had it 
 says he wanted food liar he wanted the gold 
 whyd he come in our camp 
 says they were deserters they were afraid to fight dont believe in saddam anyway they flew the gunship up here to hide out when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them so they shot first 
 i told you dont push me around 
 stop it 
 i told you he tried to steal our gold he tried to kill us 
 what happened 
 get off him 
 he snuck in here thinking we were asleep only i wasnt sleeping would have slit our throats if i hadnt stopped him 
 get off him 
 then get up and do something about it 
 you got no reason to hit me im getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around 
 i told you when i straighten someone out they stay straightened this is how it works nobody touches the gold except when we are on the move and someones carrying it nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it agreed 
 you got no reason to do that 
 maybe i dont need your ideas maybe i can do better on my own 
 maybe i do 
 maybe you have got ideas of your own for the gold maybe you have already got things worked out 
 you have had your say wes now leave it 
 you are the one with all the ideas 
 what if we get separated way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share 
 we started this together and we are staying together so theres no point in splitting things up now 
 maybe we should split it up now 
 what about it 
 what about the gold 
 it will be too dark to make our way back now lets bed down for the night and head out at first light 
 all right i will go up then you send up the gold and 
 you ready 
 ready when you are 
 i dont think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins wes we will send the gold up then me and jaeger will climb back 
 i heard 
 epps 
 got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up doesnt hurt to have a look out either 
 what am i supposed to do 
 all right lets break out some utility shovels lanterns and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting me and jaeger will climb down and see what we can see 
 move 
 missile 
 so we wait 
 and they cant fly around out there forever 
 weird they didnt chase us 
 i dont know theres a lot of space up here they could be just about 
 whered they go 
 basically but the map has been pretty precise so far i dont think it will be too hard to 
 otherwise whatever we are looking for could be anywhere 
 got to be some kind of landmark something distinctive 
 what do you figure it to be 
 should be easy going from here stay on the pass straight to the dot 
 let me see the map 
 the us army always an adventure 
 picks up again just on the other side 
 probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here worn down to nothing now 
 not much of a pass 
 we are not going to find anything standing here lets get to climbing 
 and find the treasure and get it and get back to the humvee and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off but thats about it 
 all we have got to do is make it to the top 
 theres nothing we can do we shouldnt even be here in the first place 
 we cant just go off and 
 i dont want to see people killed any more than you but we try to help out we die and all we do is die 
 we can fight thats what we are here for to fight the iraqis to help the shiites and the khurds 
 theres nothing we can do 
 the soldiers are going to kill those people 
 all right lets get out of here 
 yeah 
 ready 
 should have at least gotten the map off of him blows up with him then we did all this for nothing 
 you just go when i say go 
 what if its a valloro N just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us 
 break it out 
 for climbing 
 we have got rope 
 maybe thats all the iraqis could afford okay maybe they got it on discount maybe the fuse is messed up or maybe its going to go off in two seconds and we wont have to worry about getting jaeger down off there all we will have to worry about is finding the pieces 
 should have blown already delayed fuse thats vietnam stuff 
 i dont know and i wasnt about to mess with it 
 what kind of mine 
 how tough you have to be to make the army all you have got to do is shoot a gun and stop a bullet 
 hes an idiot and hes not nearly as hard as he thinks 
 hes not so 
 not much chance of that jaegers an idiot 
 maybe we are crazy for doing this but if we do it we do it right i just needed to explain that in a way i wouldnt have to do it again 
 him getting us stranded out here doesnt do much good either 
 you two fightings not going to get us anything 
 low on gas got to refill 
 what are you doing 
 they shouldnt have been out this way thats all im saying 
 deserters would have run they wouldnt have engaged 
 this is miles from the battle lines they were probably deserters 
 we shouldnt have been here epps there is a war going on 
 they shouldnt have been here 
 oh jesus they have stopped 
 wha 
 they stopped 
 we are going to keep driving 
 what are we going to do 
 no please not again 
 why yes jaeger i believe it is 
 id settle for being alive really alive would be fine 
 i know you think this is crazy but a couple of hours from now you are going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there 
 what 
 oh god 
 yeah welcome to beautiful iraq land of enchantment and riches 
 im thinking about when this war is over why you figure im here cause i got tired of being president of gm if a brother doesnt play ball or deal drugs there arent too many big money prospects around and im not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies wars so i say if maybe theres something out there what the hell thats what i say 
 you are out of your minds you know that both of you you dont even know if theres anything out there what the hell are you thinking 
 better grab up some sand to take home to your family 
 damn this is sweet we are going to be home in no time 
 a casual one 
 there you go jaeger just find the buried treasure and you are a millionaire 
 its a map i think thats what it is 
 help im being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory 
 whats it say 
 its a fortune box 
 paper 
 can you eat it if you cant eat it i really dont care what it is 
 well based on my knowledge of the region its culture and her people i would have to say its a box 
 i didnt learn arabic because we were getting shipped here you dont learn it in a couple of weeks i studied it in high school 
 like learning arabic you are gonna learn arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here 
 you know so much about the middle east you know where we can get something to eat 
 and its very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone its considered offensive 
 not up to us up to the iraqis all they have to do is get out of kuwait 
 think we are going to do it think we are going to war 
 hes going to slow down 
 hes not slowing 
 he will slow down 
 epps i dont think hes slowing down 
 we will make up some kind of lie they wont find the gold 
 well this is it we get the car find some americans we find americans we will be all right 
 thats what i hear dont matter girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold 
 really 
 id go to australia lot of land not many people i think after this id like to quit people for awhile and the girls go crazy for brothers down there 
 what 
 australia 
 how the hell should i know 
 i have never been anywhere i wouldnt know where to go where would you go 
 i dont know 
 still am theres more gold than i thought and since theres only two of us now where should i go 
 thought you were going to buy a car 
 im thinking about taking a trip 
 what 
 epps 
 dont make so much out of it only reason i havent figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i have been too busy figuring ways to stay alive believe me if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had im no better than anybody else i have just been busier 
 yeah even after that you didnt take it out on me except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now but id say you have been very fair i just think its a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple 
 threatened to blow my brains out 
 this whole time you have kept your head you didnt go money simple like me and wes you have just been trying to figure how to get us out of here and you have been fair too i mean even after iyou know 
 thanks 
 i want you to know i dont know i just think you are a hell of a guy 
 yeah 
 epps 
 then im a rich man 
 yeah but why me what if the car doesnt stop 
 somebody has to 
 why do i have to lie in the road 
 you lie in the middle of the road look like you are hurt when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head 
 how do we do that 
 a cars got to come along sooner or later when it does we jack it 
 well 
 you shouldnt think about things like that it will just make you crazy 
 what if it hadnt been wes what ifi mean accidently what if i had 
 we had a deal no one touches the gold until we are out of here no one breaks the deal no one had anything to worry about 
 but 
 its always been like that when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured id bettertake precautions i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own 
 when did you make the switch 
 it wasnt the gold it was the claymore mine the golds in my pack 
 thethe gold 
 damn it we lost the horses 
 we go this way 
 which way do we go 
 no but i figure nows a real good time to start 
 can you ride a horse 
 me i say you dont have enough brains to be stupid 
 i didnt say that i never said 
 you were shot we were standing right there you were shot 
 wes 
 maybemaybe if we traded them the gold if we gave it to them they might let us live they might not kill us 
 you come up with a better plan let me know 
 we cant just sit here waiting to die 
 with what against how many 
 maybemaybe we can fight our way out 
 i dont know 
 why havent they killed us 
 i dont know they killed wes 
 is that good or bad 
 shiites i think 
 what do you make of them 
 we keep going thats what we do we ignore them maybe they ignore us 
 what do we do 
 sun rises in the east we go the opposite direction may not find anything but at least we will know we are heading towards saudi arabia 
 to where 
 we cant stay here even if that wasnt an iraqi soldier its only a matter of time before some show up get all the water you can carry and we will head out on foot 
 what do we do 
 i dont know he didnt have a uniform on hehe had on white robes like the guys who killed wes 
 an iraqi 
 shoot them 
 i just said i would i dont think i 
 dont go bitch on me now you were going to kill me kill them 
 i dont have a weapon 
 cant you 
 well you are going to start with a bang cause you have got four of them to take down 
 ii never killed anyone before i told you that 
 and then shoot them 
 and then what 
 slip out your mN 
 what are we going to do 
 they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them they couldnt tell in the dark 
 oh god 
 they must be saudis its a saudi checkpoint oh sweet jesus come on come on 
 i dont know something wes had taught me i think it means dont shoot we are your friends 
 what did you say 
 probably 
 thats if the war is even still going on way things were shaping up its probably long over 
 hell they will probably just surrender to us probably 
 even if they are iraqis probably all they will do is take us prisoner for awhile got to figure we are still kicking their asses in the war they dont want any trouble 
 yeah i guess we should 
 well we should identify ourselves 
 well 
 epps what if they are not saudi 
 we can head back for our lines and they dont even have to know about the gold 
 couldnt be syria we couldnt have gone that far north its got to be saudi come on 
 which boarder saudi kuwait syria 
 place all alone like that must be a boarder check point 
 what do you figure it is 
 yeah but we made that deal while wes was still alive hes gone time for a new deal 
 the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here 
 i just want to look at it remind me of what im dying for 
 dont you touch it 
 you know what im going to do im just going to take a second i want to look at the gold 
 we have got to keep moving while theres still light 
 just let me rest for a second 
 no 
 eppsepps im gonna stop for a second 
 its a desert thats what deserts do at night they get cold 
 getting cold 
 okay then we go this way 
 i pick that way 
 you sure you want me too 
 we cant just sit here we have got to start moving so pick 
 its got to be going better than this 
 wonder how the wars going 
 if we can find the hummer or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay we have got enough water for that but we wont make another day otherwise 
 what do you think our chances are 
 damn 
 sorry 
 i never had anything before epps i never was anybody not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins when i was in high school i used to 
 its all right i dont like it but its over now 
 i know what i did just now was crazy but you got to understand how much i want that gold 
 makes two of us 
 i dont want to die 
 yeah 
 epps 
 what yeah 
 you still got a map on you 
 really im not remember how i was talking i wanted to blow away all those iraqis thats all it was was talk i was scared out of my mind to go to war i still havent gotten over stepping on that land mine 
 sure 
 i never killed anybody before i talk a good game but im not like that 
 yeah well me too 
 im glad i didnt have to kill you im glad it didnt come to that 
 is it all right if i stand up 
 im sorry about that epps 
 that helicopter passes and the only thing we are close to is death 
 i dont want it this way i wouldnt kill you just to kill you but i cant let you lose the gold for me not when we are so close 
 and you you have got it all together 
 im not like wes wes was crazy 
 first wes now you 
 they will search the pack 
 we will lie 
 they will ask questions want to know why we were out here 
 what do you mean no they can fly us home 
 no 
 we need something a flare a signal mirror 
 no 
 then he will be when those iraqis get to him he was going to kill you he was one blink away from it hes dead epps and im sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass 
 what if hes not 
 wes is dead 
 we cant just leave him 
 forget wes 
 we got to go back we got to go back for wes 
 we will find our way we will 
 how 
 we will find our way 
 what are we going to do how are we going to find our way back 
 you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you are wrong and you are not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it we are heading northeast 
 it should or it will least going back the way we came we know what we are up against 
 theres another pass on the photo we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up and it should get us back down 
 northeast thats away from the hummer further into iraqi 
 we should head northeast 
 it stays as it is we are halfway home now lets not blow it by people getting ideas 
 wes might be right about that 
 not when you are up here with the gold i guess not 
 just had to get the pack unhooked from the line it didnt seem that long 
 what the hell took so long 
 yeah yeah that will work 
 all right you go up i will send up the gold then follow 
 someones got to send the gold up it cant get on the line by itself 
 i dont see how that plans any better 
 jesus jaeger 
 why do i have to stay down here 
 whats to stop him if he wanted to all he has to do is cut the line 
 hes not going to leave us 
 we send the gold up whats to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here 
 what 
 what 
 wait 
 you dont have to imagine it not anymore now all you have got to think up is what its going to buy you 
 i wouldnt know i never imagined this not in my whole life did i ever imagine this 
 its not like i figured its cold and its heavier than i imagined 
 yeah bwana you got it 
 is it dead 
 its just a mongoose 
 its giving 
 maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore 
 i feel air probably opens up outside somewhere thats where the light comes from couldnt see it with the lanternon 
 must be a compartment 
 get up off your ass and dig 
 we have been digging we have been digging for hours if there was anything here to find we would have found it 
 get up and dig 
 im not and im not doing anything because theres nothing down here 
 it looks like you are not doing anything 
 what does it look like im doing 
 what are you doing 
 so where do we start 
 a whole lot of nothing 
 right now i wouldnt be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns 
 think there might be more iraqis 
 if they land we can take them if they dont land then we have got nothing to worry about 
 if they land 
 they cant shoot us in here 
 they are going to kill us 
 we are not going to do anything 
 what are we going to do what the hell are we going to do 
 just stay down 
 where the hell is it 
 stay low 
 where is it whered it go 
 i hope it means something otherwise 
 but the white dot in the middle thats got to mean something 
 something like that 
 x marks the spot 
 so good bye shiites thanks for playing we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go 
 not enough we are out numbered and out gunned theyd cut us to shreds 
 the shiites are on our side i didnt know that 
 they are doing more than slapping 
 what are they doing in the middle of nowhere 
 well its iraq im not sure but im guessing that has something to do with them being here 
 what are they doing here 
 iraqis a bunch of them 
 single shots doesnt mean a fire fight thats not a battle going on 
 its a fire fight 
 dont 
 shut up and listen 
 i dont hear any 
 yeah i understand wes doesnt want to come along in the first place but he gets a third of the find thats a sweet deal 
 i didnt have to stop anything cause nobody was going to do nothing we are in this together understand 
 just figure its my map i ought to hang on to it 
 you are not losing trust are you 
 its the treasure thats what it is 
 this whatever it is 
 if we step on a mine we will know it was let me see the maps 
 you dont know that it could be a trick 
 wes is right if there were any more mines we would have found them hell that one you stepped on was probably old anyway left over from the war with iran 
 you are going to blow yourselves up 
 dont let me die epps i dont want to die 
 when we start running suck up your breath you are going to get the wind knocked out of you 
 you are not going to let me die are you dont let me die 
 you are going to be fine 
 thats going to do it right im going to be okay 
 me and wes each going take an end of the rope run our asses of and yank you off the mine 
 hows this going to work 
 it falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up 
 im the one who can feel my leg and its falling asleep 
 its not falling asleep you have only been standing there for three minutes 
 my leg is falling asleep 
 epps my leg is falling asleep 
 i said nobody dies nobody dies 
 epps 
 theres a way 
 i said be cool all right now be cool 
 you are moving away because its going to blow up isnt it its going to blow up 
 we are going to be right over here 
 why you got to move away to talk 
 me and wes are just going to talk 
 where you going 
 we are going to get off all right we will get you off of there justbe cool 
 howm i gonna relax standing on a mine 
 just relax 
 its a mine isnt it 
 just be cool

 faster we get there faster we get back 
 heyhey slow up you dont have to go so fast 
 i got thatsir

 i didnt miss it i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit youd want to turn back 
 and you missed this how are you going to miss something like this 
 i know 
 look at it look at it shot to hell its been leaking gas since the fire fight i told you to check for damage 
 millionaires man 
 itd make their heads explode 
 i know i know but im saying if they knew we are going to be millionaires man millionaires

 im just thinking you know if the rest of the boys knew what we are doing i mean if they knew what we were coming back with 
 what 
 lets go 
 yeah yeah shes fine 
 she okay 
 i steady it out they blow us out of the sand 
 steady it out 
 look at you not even breaking a sweat you are cool boy you are cool 
 figure they dont want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them 
 its the only way we drive 
 they are not going to 
 we run they will shoot us anyway if we keep driving they might think we friendlies iraqis or even if they know we are americans they might get scared think we are part of a detachment and keep on going 
 they will shoot us 
 we can see them they can see us we run they chase 
 we have got to do something we have got to turn around 
 shut up both of you shut the hell up 
 take the goddamn binoculars 
 whwhat do you think 
 take the binoculars 
 you know you sound just like a boy whos never 
 and im talking about enjoying myself 
 its not about being fun its about being smart you take that money you take care of it let it grow and you dont ever have to do anything again ever thats freedom thats what im talking about 
 oh thats fun 
 invest it 
 what are you going to do with your third 
 you are getting gold and you are going to blow it on wheels 
 a car you are going to buy a car 
 yeah i meant you know what im going to do with it im going to buy a sixty three havette stingray all tricked out and cherry im going to be so sweet 
 third what you are going to do with your third 
 you know what im doing with my part of the gold 
 but thats the great thing about gold a little goes a long way 
 cool it jaeger hey wes wes 
 you are such a pussy you know that howd you get in the army 
 roger that 
 now this is war 
 we go we get rich we go home its that easy 
 its going to be cool wes its all all right 
 but we all got to be in for this we all go or we do nothing 
 we disappear for awhile we disappear we came back nobody knows nothing 
 its war people get lost all the time in war cut off 
 what we are doing is kicking ass for gods sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews the war is over we have just got to keep shooting people cause the army spent all this money and we have got to put on a show for the taxpayers 
 and you know what that area is its iraq iraq we are doing a little thing with them right now desert storm maybe you have read about it 
 christ wes tell him you know this stuff 
 wellllll if you read it it must be true was it in the star or the enquirer 
 just listen to me i have been doing some reading in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks it became part of the ottoman empire when the turks rolled in they raped they pillaged the usual stuff anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards they buried their treasures drew maps and hid the maps in puzzle boxes i read about this man i read about it 
 i think you have got some issues to deal with really when we get out of here im pretty sure its shrink time for you 
 wait wait 
 dont even you are not going to show me that tired map 
 id like to go home alive with a couple of iraqi scalps hanging from my belt 
 everybodys got a job to do figure it this way at least you get to go home alive 
 they finally start the ground war and where are we same place we have been since we got here securing freedom for the dirt 
 yeah thats exactly what i think you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes lets get out of here we got sand to protect 
 you think 
 i did it i got the box open 
 what what 
 oh my god 
 you all want to lay off god i hope the iraqis shoot me put me out of my misery 
 i have got to have something to tell people when i get home besides i protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place 
 why you in such a hurry to get to shooting 
 this is stupid its going on a month now how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards they can bomb them all they want saddam aint going anywhere without a ground assault what the hell is the army waiting for 
 there might be 
 yeah the deed to the brooklyn bridge 
 there might be something in there 
 oh man you are not going to fall for that 
 blow me have i said that to you guys recently blow me 
 dont worry about jaeger he uses his personality as a form of birth control 
 another month in this desert and i might just 
 blow me 
 you know what i think you got schwarzkopf you did you got the general right in the ass now thats good shooting 
 no you are not 
 i told you im shooting iraqis 
 ready for what what are you supposed to be doing 
 dont get pissed at me just cause i want to be ready when this war starts 
 knock it off 
 atatatatat 
 what does it look like im doing im killing iraqis atatatatat atat atat 
 what are you doing 
 atatatatat atatatatat 
 saddams got a boil on his ass 
 they are all good ones satellites we have got can snap a shot of the boil on saddams ass 
 some good ones 
 the photos 
 ready for what sightseeing 
 justwant to be ready when we do 
 planning on going to war all by your lonesome 
 i could use some recon photos too 
 that shouldnt be too hard to read iraq is the pink thing 
 a map all i got is maps im gonna have delayed map syndrome when i finally get out of here what kind of map you need topographical geographical thermal 
 im looking for a favor i need a map of iraqi 
 hey jaeger whats up 
 woods 
 you actually got around to killing someone im impressed i guess you are only half a bitch 
 we had to take shelter in the checkpoint jesus wes i killed the iraqis in there 
 when my shiite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic turns out we have been kicking ass in this little war they figure we have finally gotten saddam off their backs they brought me to their camp cleaned me up fed me im their new best buddy america number one joe but theres something the shiites cant figure out they cant figure out why my two buddies two fellow americans left me out in the desert they cant seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost its almost as if they were iraqi spies or something and i have got to tell you they hate anything thats got to do with the iraqis see how i mean 
 probably shot a few scattered the rest murderers 
 think the iraqis killed them all 
 the white reflects the sun it keeps you cooler thats why they wear them 
 you are going to burn up in those 
 you want to say some words 
 maybe we ought toyou know bury him say some words over him 
 hed just slow us down and drink our water and if we ran into any more iraqis you know hed sell us out 
 so we will take him with us at least til we get back to the hummer 
 im not wasting my water on him 
 i think he wants something to drink 
 all last night he could have been 
 maybe we should give him some water 
 he lived through that 
 says hes one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter 
 hes a soldier he doesnt need a weapon hes got rocks hes got bare hands 
 with what he doesnt have a weapon 
 i think we found something 
 what the hell are you doing 
 what do you see 
 yeah we are down 
 you down 
 guess we know what the next stop is 
 its got a bottom 
 lines up with the map and the photos 
 what do you think 
 just seems weird they didnt chase us 
 maybe they are as scared of us as we are of them 
 we make it or we go back empty handed 
 think we can make it 
 i have got a new agenda now its get rich the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all 
 you are the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad 
 funny you should say that while we are out looking for gold 
 we are american soldiers we dont abandon people 
 we have to do something 
 so 
 i know you are a pussy i know that 
 is there anything you do know 
 those people down there are shiites you have got shiites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north neither of them have got much love for saddam probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some 
 jesus what the hell did he do that for they are iraqis why are iraqis killing iraqis 
 anytime you want to do something about it just let 
 im getting tired of you riding me jaeger 
 probably would have too if epps wasnt around to stop you 
 if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself 
 you want to crawl crawl 
 that dont mean nothing iraqis could have just spread them out like that make us think we are in the clear 
 havent found a mine for half a mile or more 
 until we are out of the mine field is how long 
 how long we going to keep this up 
 doesnt matter we are not going to be able to get him off it anyway 
 epps 
 you have to go with us you cant walk back 
 really what is that an order private 
 you have to go with us wes 
 you two dont even know how crazy you are you want to go on your sick little treasure hunt then go ahead but mark me absent 
 as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway we are not that far we can make it 
 then lets go back while we still can 
 we are not stranded we have got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back 
 i figuredi figured youd turn back 
 so you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere 
 we just about got killed you know what happened we just about got killed and you want to go on 
 we are not going anywhere not til we get what we came for 
 we have to go back 
 we got to get out of here 
 yeah well we are not 
 i thought we were dead 
 you see that right by us they went right by you had them epps you called it

 you are insane if you think you will find anything and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive 
 you know its real you know its real and you know its there you know it 
 epps you are smarter than this jaeger i understand but you are smarter 
 so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase its crazy tell him its crazy epps 
 its real im telling you its real 
 its not a hundred miles its a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain pure desert mountains a river if the map is even real 
 its about a hundred miles from where we are now how long do you think it would take us to 
 you dont know where the iraqis have moved to and our forces havent even engaged the republican guard yet we dont know 
 its right here this region annagaf i got recon photos there are no troops there no fighting 
 you are not saying what i think you are saying i cant believe you are even thinking it 
 withwith millions millions of dollars

 wewe could go home with something else 
 those soldiers have got loafers on what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers 
 thats it its over eighteen hours into the war and its over 
 its a container break the seal 
 itsitsi dont know what it is 
 you know what wes if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war 
 the longer the air force hits the iraqis the safer itii be for us when we have to engage 
 atatatatat 
 this is so weird its happening but its not its like a tv show and we are part of it 
 atatatatat 
 the only thing i worry about is how much iraqi ass im going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over the only people who i have got anything to worry about are the poor dumb camel jockeys who dont know enough to get out of the way when i come rolling at them an mN in each hand and a grenade between my teeth now if you will excuse me soldier id like to get back to my box i have got a treasure to find 
 you ever think about it you ever worry 
 come on man i almost had this thing open 
 you ever think about dying 
 what 
 jaeger 
 why would they do all that if we werent 
 it doesnt mean anything 
 we are going to war arent we if they are doing all that it must mean we are going to war 
 whats your point wes you have a point 
 they are cancelling all leaves all passes no more drills we stand at full ready starting 
 like i said so 
 thats in two days 
 yeah so 
 you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait 
 what 
 jaeger 
 i dont care if theres a lump of coal in here i just want to be able to rub epps face in it when i crack this thing

 people were suffering in afganistan and we didnt do anything 
 people are suffering 
 i dont think we will go to war we shouldnt even be here this isnt our fight its a regional conflict it should be decided regionally 
 we ought to kick their asses anyway even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses

 well its fixed so you will have to eat it 
 im not hungry 
 it seems i am destined to endure many frustrationsbut at the same time i am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction and that even if it remains incomplete my search has not been in vain 
 there goes another of your disciples 
 a shelldweller they live in the outer shell of the city quite unique there have been two here before they smell 
 good lord 
 what 
 but we need a creative dissent our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus but the differences are differences of emphasis not of fundamentals now the new alignments greatest need is to communicate with all its elements rather than march along in parallel line that never converge tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly we will gain a new unity 
 what are you talking about when did you sleep last do you know what your trouble is you are blind you have been here so long you cant see what is happening we must unite we need unity we need action we have come to a time when we must 
 you always manage to avoid the issue whats wrong with our present condition we are comfortable and we have plenty of foodi feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat why incite trouble you should examine your emotions it is senseless 
 i have said many times before and i guess i will have to repeat it again for your 
 then why are they holding us here why dont they destroy us right away economically its not sound at all very much unlike 
 but you cant we must escape 
 thx and me 
 who whos leaving 
 we are leaving 
 what 
 we are leaving 
 whats going onwhat are you doing 
 we cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed you can work with us an organized plan of escape must be devised first could you see anything you want to leave you are not like them you must have left something or someone 
 i thought you were through with it 
 incredible 
 we must escape we have plans we can leave we must wait until 
 it may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design 
 thats the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard 
 ask him about the air he looks out of breath 
 wait i will talk to him 
 i wonder how far he went hes gathered invaluable information out there 
 hes coming back for the rest of us he cant make it alone 
 impossible 
 i can just barely see him i think hes leaving 
 no one could have imagined anything onethousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry this world is in a state of staticmobility we are at the same time moving and standing still 
 what 
 i have got it astounding 
 on the contrary it absolutely proves what i have always felt we are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits we are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth we must continue the search 
 not very encouraging 
 out of a random selection of N locations with N possible sightings there were N absolute negatives and four conditionals most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted 
 well 
 you have nothing to fear you are safe again 
 how far did you go was it cold 
 no look three degrees from the central azimuth 
 i cant see him at all hes been destroyed 
 look 
 what 
 but you cantyou

 where you guys at 
 whats up 
 be right back 
 exgirlfriend 
 congratulations you just built your first ticker 
 its working 
 no you are not you just dont understand them here do what i tell you 
 i terrible with mechanical things 
 i guess i didnt realize how much i needed him he kept me straight its been tough every second since 
 your partner 
 i know i was working a drug ring deep cover played the part too well when they pulled me out i wasnt a cop anymore my fiance had dumped me next thing i knew i was out here on the street doped up auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me cleaned me up gave me a second chance he promised captain winters hed look out for me 
 take a tip from the bomb boys always assess if only for a second 
 pittsburgh two years ago partner died no backup i was too gungho as usual 
 you dont have to talk about it 
 what 
 how long were you hooked 
 i dont know theres an old saying when in doubt cut the yellow wire 
 which ones which 
 one shuts it down one turns arms it 
 so cut both 
 i dont know its strange its not the best career path but when you get the bug theres nothing you can do about it see when you beat one of these things 
 why do you do it 
 we have gotta be in this business you dont exactly make alot of outside commitments 
 you guys seem pretty tight 
 well its more than we had ten minutes ago 
 right 
 what not bad you have got a series of bombs devices that may or may not be connected set by one or many nutjobs who may or may not be linked 
 not bad for bomb squad eh 
 `til we get a better lead 
 how long are we going to stay 
 industrial wood oil separately any one of these things could lead in several directions but together 
 nitrocellulose what is that some kind of explosive 
 bingo 
 look its a longshot 
 then its gotta be here somewhere 
 yep 
 this is where the van was parked 
 no ninetyninety percent of them are full of baloney they are into the power trip not the damage what scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants then disappear the worst of the bunch they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever and they love the carnage 
 except they will blow you up if you dont play along 
 typical profile usually losers nobodies that are afraid to confront their victims they like scaring people thats why they call in their threats same mentality as obscene phone callers 
 with a little training you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something thatd finish off that alleged car of yours heck didnt you ever watch macgyver 
 just how easy is it to build a device 
 there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith bill jones id see them up ahead in the hall call their name but they wouldnt turn around cia funny thing theyd always disappear after the first half of the course 
 sounds like terrorist heaven 
 top of my class at west point thank you very much then off to redstone first half of the course we learned how to build devices second half wed take them apart everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs 
 cream of the crop huh you 
 redstones the army training center in alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers 
 you mentioned something called redstone 
 an abandoned machine shop nice place to build devices low rent too but you and rice ruined their perfect hideout 
 i dont know you tell me 
 so what were they doing here 
 then lets go see what they missed 
 the place has already be combed forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside 
 drive 
 oh yeah prove it 
 no you look mister first you dont go calling my men names its bad for morale second us punks happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did 
 hey look 
 nice performance back there whered you learn that mike ditka sensitivity seminar 
 where 
 only once at redstone 
 shes not talking but she could be so obviously you have seen one of these devices before 
 ira device deadliest class of tickers in existence computerized multiple sensors booby traps the works first showed up in a series of ira bombings in london couple years ago one of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers the girl is she irish 
 dont push it slick 
 anything else i should know 
 treat we treat devices 
 so you are the device squad and you defuse devices 
 we dont use the bword bad luck 
 mike reilly 
 by the way im glass this is tj and pooch 
 be cool around my men they dont trust strangers and try not to swear so much its unattractive 
 now wait just a fucking 
 this isnt bumper cars its brain surgery you wanna work with us you do it our way understand 
 what 
 that cop who bought it you didnt tell us he was your partner 
 what was why 
 we have got one hour are you coming or not 
 when you need us you love us when you dont we are shunned by the rest of the department 
 what are you talking about 
 we can start in the area where the robbery occurred 
 alright lets check it out 
 thanks 
 sorry about that thats an inch of the stuff imagine what the whole thingd do 
 what do you mean 
 highgrade det cord this girl either shes got strange taste in jewelry or shes into serious demolition 
 off a girls wrist a suspect 
 where did you get this 
 you the bomb squad 
 who the heck are you 
 nothing maybe they gave up split town 
 any word 
 exactly my thinking except none of the targets can actually be linked to government political or special interest concerns they seem to be just unrelated industrial companies some insured some not 
 political 
 we work fast enough for you 
 you got it 
 bev give `em a call find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area 
 punks huh 
 hey matches are a very big thing in our line of work

 thank you rose 
 your ship is a wonder mr andrews truly

 diamond yes it is N carats

 where to miss 
 kinda like we are doin right now uh oh 
 hes an expinkerton cals father hired him to keep cal out of trouble to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town 
 pretty tough for a valet this fella 
 he does landscapes 
 i believe you are blushing mr big artiste i cant imagine monsieur monet blushing 
 a diamond a very rare diamond called the heart of the ocean 
 what is it a sapphire 
 not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out 
 should i be expecting him anytime soon 
 cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere 
 zat is true i am not used to working in such orreeble conditions hey monet 
 will this light do dont artists need good light 
 sssshh come here 
 fabrizio said you might be up 
 i have to get back they will miss me please jack for both our sakes leave me alone 
 you are right only you can do that 
 its not up to you to save me jack 
 i dont think so they have got you in a glass jar like some butterfly and you are goin to die if you dont break out maybe not right away cause you are strong but sooner or later the fire in you is goin to go out 
 you are making this very hard i will be fine really 
 no wait let me try to get this out you are amazing and i know i have nothing to offer you rose i know that but im involved now you jump i jump remember i cant turn away without knowin that you are goin to be alright 
 jack i 
 rose you are no picnic you are a spoiled little brat even but under that you are a strong pure heart and you are the most amazingly astounding girl i have ever known and 
 i like that arent we supposed to wish on it 
 that was a long one my father used to say that whenever you saw one it was a soul going to heaven 
 i did didnt i look a shooting star 
 uh huh you got mailed to the wrong address 
 a mistake 
 you are not one of them theres been a mistake 
 just move with me dont think 
 i dont know the steps 
 you are still my best girl cora 
 may i cut in miss 
 time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin 
 jack must you go 
 cal surely you remember mr dawson 
 i saw that in a nickelodeon once and i always wanted to do it 
 they didnt teach you that in finishing school here its easy watch closely 
 i think i would and teach me to spit too like a man why should only men be able to spit its unfair 
 sure if you like 
 you mean one leg on each side scandalous can you show me 
 alright we are going we will drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we will ride horses on the beach right in the surf but you have to ride like a cowboy none of that sidesaddle stuff 
 why cant i be like you jack just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it say we will go there sometime to that pier even if we only ever just talk about it 
 yeah it was great money i could make a dollar a day sometimes but only in summer when it got cold i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing 
 a whole ten cents 
 well then logging got to be too much like work so i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica thats a swell place they even have a rollercoaster i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece 
 so then what mr wandering jack 
 well alright theres something in me jack i feel it i dont know what it is whether i should be an artist or i dont know a dancer like isadora duncan a wild pagan spirit 
 im sorry really i am 
 listen buster i hate caviar and im tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head 
 you wouldnt last two days theres no hot water and hardly ever any caviar 
 you know my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist living in a garret poor but free 
 you wouldnta jumped 
 and 
 i see you 
 you have a gift jack you do you see people 
 no no just with her hands 
 i think you must have had a love affair with her 
 she had beautiful hands 
 you liked this woman you used her several times 
 yup thats one of the great things about paris lots of girls willing take their clothes off 
 and these were drawn from life 
 well they didnt think too much of em in paree 
 oh no oh im so sorry truly 
 well they didnt think too much of em in paree 
 jack these are quite good really they are 
 may i 
 just some sketches 
 whats this 
 well i guess i will tonight 
 oh jack please dont judge me until you have seen my world 
 it is that simple 
 if only it were that simple 
 so dont marry him 
 yes exactly 
 so you feel like you are stuck on a train you cant get off cause you are marryin this fella 
 worse im afraid 
 is he your boyfriend 
 penguin oh cal he is them 
 that penguin last night is he one of them 
 oh god i am such an utter fool 
 uh huh they will be sorry course you will be dead 
 i dont it wasnt just one thing it was everything it was them it was their whole world and i was trapped in it like an insect in amber i just had to get away just run and run and run and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship even the titanic wasnt big enough not enough to get away from them and before id really though about it i was over the rail i was so furious i will show them they will be sorry 
 thats not what i was thinking what i was thinking was what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out 
 look i know what you must be thinking poor little rich girl what does she know about misery 
 you are welcome rose 
 here i am i i want to thank you for what you did not just for for pulling me back but for your discretion 
 well here you are 
 jack i feel like such an idiot it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you 
 jack 
 mr dawson i 
 thats quite a moniker i may hafta get you to write that down 
 rose rose dewitt bukater 
 so you got a name by the way 
 uh yes of course after you 
 could i speak to you in private 
 hello again 
 i have got you i wont let go 
 help help 
 pleased to meet you mr dawson 
 im jack dawson 
 thats what everybody says but with all due respect im not the one hanging off the back of a ship 
 you are crazy 
 sorry just you look like kind of an indoor girl anyway i went through some thin ice and im tellin ya water that cold like that right down there it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body you cant breath you cant think least not about anything but the pain which is why im not looking forward to jumping in after you but like i said i dont see a choice i guess im kinda hoping you will come back over the rail and get me off the hook here 
 i know what ice fishing is 
 well they have some of the coldest winters around and i grew up there near chippewa falls once when i was a kid me and my father were ice fishing out on lake wissota ice fishings where you chop a hole in the 
 no 
 ever been to wisconsin 
 freezing maybe a couple degrees over 
 how cold 
 it would hurt im not saying it wouldnt to be honest im a lot more concerned about the water being so cold 
 the fall alone would kill you 
 dont be absurd you will be killed 
 i cant im involved now if you let go i have to jump in after you 
 you are distracting me go away 
 you would have done it already now come on take my hand 
 what do you mean no i wont dont presume to tell me what i will and will not do you dont know me 
 no you wont 
 no stay where you are i mean it i will let go 
 take my hand i will pull you back in 
 and wake me of course if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful 
 yes sir 
 mmmmm well im off maintain speed and heading mr lightoller 
 its make the bergs harder to see with no breaking water at the base 
 yes like a mill pond not a breath of wind 
 i dont think i have ever seen such a flat calm in N years at sea 
 we were pissin in the wind the whole time 
 im sorry 
 oh yeah yeah im a believer she was there 
 you think she was really there 
 then we are all meeting your grandmother for the first time 
 what past she has never once not once ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago 
 maybe she wants to make peace with the past 
 thats enough 
 wait can you give us something go on here like who had access to the safe what about this lovejoy guy the valet did he have the combination 
 if your grandma is who she says she is she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank and that makes you my new best friend i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery 
 april N N 
 you had it the entire time 
 dont come any closer 
 im afraid im feeling a little tired mr lovett 
 rose tell us more about the diamond what did hockley do with it after that 
 well thats the general idea my dear 
 i can still feel its weight if you could have felt it not just seen it 
 its been N years and i can still smell the fresh paint the china had never been used the sheets had never been slept in 
 just tell us what you can 
 its been N years 
 nathan hockley right pittsburgh steel tycoon for a diamond necklace his son caledon hockley bought in france for his fiancee you a week before he sailed on titanic and the claim was filed right after the sinking so the diamond had to have gone down with the ship see the date 
 someone named hockley i should imagine 
 i tracked it down through insurance records and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy do you know who the claiment was rose 
 it was a dreadful heavy thing i only wore it this once 
 louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone called the blue diamond of the crown which disappeared in N about the time louis lost everything from the neck up the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too recut into a heartlike shape and it became le coeur de la mer the heart of the ocean today it would be worth more than the hope diamond 
 i should like to see my drawing 
 would you like anything 
 there thats nice i have to have my pictures when i travel and freddy of course isnt that right sweetie 
 yes very nice have you met my granddaughter lizzy she takes care of me 
 is your stateroom alright 
 goodbye mother 
 rose get in the boat 
 of course its unfair we are women our choices are never easy 
 its so unfair 
 do you want to se me working as a seamstress is that what you want do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction our memories scattered to the winds my god rose how can you be so selfish 
 how can you put this on my shoulders 
 i dont understand you it is a fine match with hockley and it will insure our survival 
 your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name and that name is the only card we have to play 
 of course i know its gone you remind me every day 
 rose this is not a game our situation is precarious you know the moneys gone 
 charmed im sure 
 mother may i introduce jack dawson 
 excuse me

 im not so clumsy with fingerprints 
 have you ever figured they might extradite you 
 dont be a mug all your lifeim trying to help you you need me more than i need youhave you figured they might pick the kid up in france and extradite him 
 i have lost my taste for knickknacks 
 go aheadyou didnt used to be so fussy 
 lets see if i can bring it back to life 
 dont leethats dead 
 thats a betbut i couldnt let you walk out like that sally id have gone cuckoo back therejust thinking about you 
 and you swear when you get to the other side you will never come near either of us again 
 just smile again and be reasonable i will order dinner herejust the two of uslike old times 
 im crazy about the kid and i got him into it what do you want me to do 
 you cant bluff me any more 
 of course not but isnt it a coincidence that hes from the eighteenth precinctwhere they made the squawk 
 not because of ned 
 dont kid yourselfyou know how i stand back there 
 youd go with him 
 a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and 
 you leave the kid alone 
 thanks to me 
 hes all right 
 thats more like the old sallya little bit of fire how about ned 
 you get wise to yourself if you know whats good for you you will leave me alone everybodys entitled to one mistakewellyou are mine when the going got too rough i pulled up stakes and quit we stay quit get that and what are you going to do about it 
 get wise to yourself sallyyou are no sob story 
 i wish i could 
 because i want youwill always want youno other woman will ever take your place i want you more now than i did that first night you have forgotten all that i suppose 
 why dont you leave me alone 
 it wasnt smart even if youd gotten away without me id have found youno matter where you were 
 i didnt want to see you againthats my privilege 
 you ran away because you were afraid i dont want it to end like that 
 all rightbut what is there to face its finished 
 this is interesting why didnt you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night 
 i tried to borrow a gun from chad but 
 because i was yellow i guess 
 why 
 i wouldnt say that im glad hes deadyesid thought of killing him but i didnt 
 spose you have never thought of killing him 
 no 
 you didnt have a gun in your hand last night 
 yes yes 
 hes a swell person he told me hed rather turn one guy straight than jug a million 
 next time i get a vacation i will spend it at headquarters goodnight 
 i hope so well i guess you two can do without me i will be seeing you 
 i have got a hunch you are going to win that bet inspector 
 soon as i get that bracelet back im going to relax wish the guy that borrowed it would help me outi got to win that fifty bucks 
 for a very excellent reason from your own admission im not saying you didbut i think you know more than you are telling years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence nevertheless in your case theres plenty of it 
 why should i kill him 
 i sincerely hope so 
 thats the truthevery single word 
 maybe you will after you have thought it over 
 sure i wouldbut i dont get what you are driving at 
 and if you liked the person youd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight wouldnt you 
 well of course i wouldnt take it 
 i mean if you knew it were stolen 
 say thanks very much 
 he will be back what would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet 
 exciting wasnt it wheres jimmy

 what about all these saloons 
 get bond out of there 
 its too late 
 bring up the tracking satellite and get N out of there 
 i appreciate your assistance m but this is now a military operation 
 thank you m but this is more than your man can handle are we in agreement 
 but 
 what do they say in russia general bukharin 
 i will be sure to acknowledge N s assistance in my report to the prime minister but this is still a naval operation 
 what were you saying admiral something about this not being a job for a winesniffing skirtchasing playboy spy 
 i expect to have that gold recovered in N hours until then im imposing my own electronic silence for the sake of the economy not a word to nato the press the cia and so long as commander bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters i want him to go along as an observer are we agreed 
 N hours they have already sailed from the persian gulf 
 at least we know where the gold is when are the recovery ships due 
 and i have the entire british economy to worry about 
 i resent your tone sir i have men who are missing 
 why wasnt the ship protected why was it sailing without radar 
 admiral are you suggesting 
 excuse me but i must formally protest this meeting given the nature of whats occurred and the need for secrecy i see no reason to involve the air force the army or miN this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majestys royal navy 
 good evening i have just spoken with the prime minister at the economic summit in tokyo hes expecting a full update within the hour for those of you still unaware some forty minutes ago 
 take the girl leave the handcuffs we will drown her at sea 
 id rather die alone 
 what about the gold 
 as the advertising says tomorrow never lies 
 chernobyl will look like a campfire 
 instant meltdown 
 precisely mr bond in a matter of minutes the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium 
 so thats what the weapons grade uranium was for 
 my guards are from south africa mr bond this is their chance to get even with the formerly great britain now both of you put your hands on your heads and step forward 
 are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl 
 goodbye mister bond 
 im sure they will 
 sidney perhaps we should leave this to 
 and whats that my dear 
 dont pout sidney i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story hes from willoyds of london arent you mr bond 
 briefly 
 your choice look at the time come theres someone i want you meet about a story im thinking of publishing 
 words to live by 
 you see mr bond you and i are both men of action but your era is passing words are the new weapons satellites the new artillery and make no mistake about it in the right hands they can be as deadly as your walther ppk 
 fantastic idea mr bond perhaps i should buy it for a book its totally preposterous but you amuse me and now perhaps i can amuse you 
 or disinformation if you wanted to say beam down a signal to send a ship off course maybe one degree a minute 
 they are merely tools to disseminate information 
 although it must be fun to have all those satellites 
 and still not a thing to watch 
 welcome to the new world order mr bond churchill had his armies caesar had his legions i have my divisions news sports business entertainment and these are my foot soldiers N people working on N floors to feed N newspapers N cable news networks N magazines and N different cable tv channels in N languages 
 because its a dying city since the chinese takeover who knows what can happen tomorrow in any case this is my father charles a royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations said id never amount to anything but i turned it into this 
 so why did you leave 
 my third great uncle the earl of aberdeen negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese his soninlaw george harmsway made the first family fortune running opium into shanghai his son thomas who lost it smoking the opium and my grandfather henry who opened the first telegraph station and published the colonys first english newspaper it was a city of unlimited possibility 
 yes i can see you have hung the rest of your relatives 
 i call this the rogues gallery 
 sightseeing 
 by the way what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur mister bond 
 i can feel your pain 
 still i do miss her i only wish she could have lived to see all this 
 the only difference between a psychopath and a genius mr bond is the degree of success 
 i wonder if it runs in the family 
 i tried to save her but she remained a manic depressive fits inappropriate behavior delusions of grandeur 
 i see 
 before i became involved with paris she was always involved with the most inappropriate men playboys thrill seekers middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her 
 come lets get out of the noise i will give you a tour of the building then we will talk 
 sir elliot 
 mr bond nice to see you 
 im on my way 
 oh please mr bond we live in the information age information is currency and with the right currency you can have any piece of information besides i own the phone company what do you say twenty minutes 
 how did you get this number 
 we will see about that 
 a piece of advice mr bond dont screw with a man who buys ink by the ton its deadlier than uranium 
 which part the colonels or yours 
 i hope you have enjoyed this little charade 
 i can tell you are a man with an eye for exquisite possessions mr bond darling come here i want you to meet my wife 
 its a beautiful boat sir elliot practically glows in the dark 
 you might say i have always been one of mr valentins biggest followers 
 always nice to meet one of her majestys fellow subjects especially one with such distinguished friends 
 him he is a she at the bar 
 where can i find him 
 maybe you should talk to sidney winch owns a marine salvage company nobody knows more about the strait 
 i appreciate your time 
 next morning both boats nothing wrong my N year old grandfather thinks ghost in the computer silicon dragon 
 did you test the autopilots the satellite positioning receiver 
 the kuala lumpur ferry was N miles offcourse that night captain blamed the autopilot i suspected he was drunk until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem 
 im sorry 
 sometimes kill the crew other times torture them 
 i know pirates from sumatra want the cargo smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships 
 in the strait of malacca when a boat is even five minutes late one begins to worry mr bond 
 no N its just that i have learned from personal experience that when we get what we want somehow the reality is never as satisfying as the fantasy 
 what no lust for adventure 
 not all of us N 
 we all want what we cant have 
 actually i have never known you to do either but 
 moneypenny how indiscreet have you ever known me to kiss and tell 
 by the way james ordinarily i would never ask but werent you and that colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea 
 in the darkest moments its what i live for especially since i have heard how much you like to watch on the hidden camera 
 hello james enjoy your meeting 
 moneypenny we have got to stop meeting like this they may be on to us 
 ah james you always were a cunning linguist au revoir mon cher

 four oclock m will meet you in the conference room 
 moneypenny here i was finally getting a feel for a new tongue

 i know what i saw 
 thats absurd it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold 
 yes the ship is down there but the gold is gone 
 what are you talking about we went through all this and the ship isnt even down there 
 thats all well and good captain save for one thing theres no gold down there 
 yes the famous james bond i have heard all about you sir you were under direct orders to act as an observer and yet you had to go off on your own like some halfassed cia cowboy endangering the gold attracting that lunatic woman and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide 
 dont you think you are overreacting 
 get them out of here if he says one word shoot him 
 wait a minute 
 guard arrest these men escort them to the cutter 
 yes 
 one thing at a time i will see you in twenty minutes go

 is this another one of your games 
 oh james i have missed you 
 i thought your specialty was goodbye 
 is that any way to say hello 
 paris what are you doing here 
 to the best of my recollection mr bond i suggested no such thing in fact i was never here 
 political considerations 
 there is one last thing N elliot harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation hes also a major contributor to the party i expect him to be given every consideration 
 need i remind the two of you that elliot harmsway sir elliot harmsway is directly descended from the earl of aberdeen that his scottish ancestors practically invented hong kong and out of sheer gratitude queen victoria herself named the port aberdeen harbor in their honor 
 perhaps but it does explain how an exkgb agent turned illegalarms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a longtime friend of the people if you believe what you read in the papers 
 more scurrilous unsubstantiated gossip 
 occasionally yes british media mogul born in hong kong controls newspapers tv radio cable satellites books magazines movies computer software theme parks 
 his newspapers 
 i believe qs exact words were hopefully nothing 
 a wedding band what am i supposed to be able to do with this 
 oh i almost forgot there is one last thing before q retired he asked that i give you one other protective device

 what do you mean 
 not a lot of difference 
 my father left me the business 
 how did you get into marine salvage 
 no im going with you 
 wait here 
 the only mistake is that they didnt kill us in the elevator 
 this has got to be a mistake 
 maybe but why are we going up instead of down 
 you are seriously deranged 
 hes killed closer 
 he was my fathers best friend 
 blood or dutch 
 elliot harmsway is my uncle 
 harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold its on the sea dolphin ii and thanks to your little show and tell giving him the evidence we are the only ones who can tie him to the crime 
 listen to me im a british secret service agent and we have about two minutes before harmsway kills both of us 
 thats funny you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection 
 you heard me a gun i left mine in the car 
 what 
 do you have a gun 
 no i want sir elliot to keep them 
 why dont we just take these 
 thank you now hear this drop dead 
 just remember they think theres ten billion dollars in gold down there

 if i were you 
 the family jewels 
 and what do you call this 
 think about mom 
 i hope you will be gentle 
 i hope so 
 do i have to do everything around here 
 so charming so suave dont insult me im not one of your little london girls who falls for the lies 
 no first because i dont think its in your nature and second because theres no gold down there 
 no 
 you have to excuse miss winch she thinks shes on a seduce and destroy mission through life but she wont kill us 
 shut up 
 lets not make it a habit 
 nice to run into you again 
 i see my date is here and i think mr bond is ready to leave 
 i will keep that in mind 
 the strait can be a very dangerous place mr bond a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london doesnt carry a lot of value out here including life insurance 
 insurance lloyds of london 
 and exactly what business are you in mr bond 
 actually im here on business you might say it was a golden opportunity 
 so what brings you to kuala lumpur mr bond wait dont tell me unhappy marriage running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in london 
 pity bring him whatever he wants 
 chaperone im waiting for my dinner date 
 boyfriend

 vodka martini shaken not stirred and another for you 
 sidney winch 
 this afternoon our boats practically kissed in the harbor james bond 
 have we met 
 and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake 
 sometimes you just have to plunge into things be reckless 
 i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat 
 bourbon neat 
 a threethousand ton frigate doesnt just vanish into thin air 
 sabotage 
 the infrared satellite images no heat no flame no explosion if that boat went down where they said it did there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface 
 it doesnt quite add up 
 what do you make of all this 
 i have an excellent teacher make sure you wear the uniform 
 you are turning into quite the politician N 
 actually you are just in time admiral roebuck you know commander bond dont you 
 sorry im late 
 good luck on your mission N 
 i will give you a ring from venice 
 hopefully it wont get that far 
 but if elliot harmsway is involved with that uranium i want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth 
 we serve the interests of the british people N no matter who we may be foolish enough to elect 
 i hate to ask but did you ever think youd miss communism 
 i understand 
 you are to wear this mask at the venice carnival and wait to be contacted 
 yes N he was furious at the british plan to return hong kong and supposedly started his own negotiations with the chinese government the inquiry went nowhere but it did earn miN a rather powerful enemy 
 didnt we once investigate harmsway 
 which is also why i have withheld this information from nato and our allies 
 of course 
 the reason i invited the minister here N was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion 
 it seems N we have received a tip 
 whats harmsway done 
 able to topple governments with a single story as he says in his press 
 along with tomorrow the first worldwide newspaper circulation N million daily 
 only what i read in the newspapers 
 tell me N what do you know about elliot harmsway 
 of course minister johnstone 
 come in N you know the minister 
 yes m 
 thank you colonel everhart N id like to see you in my office why dont you and the colonel exchange numbers if you need more information

 you leave me no alternative 
 no 
 hmmm i suppose this is a step above that profession ten seconds are you leaving 
 i was an attorney 
 fifteen seconds perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney 
 i know my rights these are international waters the british navy abandoned that boat and im claiming it under international law i have the right to salvage whats on that wreck

 ayeaye sir engines to half 
 a dead head water logged timber floats straight up you sometimes see them on the east side of the channel from the logging camps on sumatra but they dont usually float this far west muncy engines to half 
 seems to be back to normal sir

 the backup does the same thing 
 about every ninety seconds the auto pilot jogs us to the west 
 whats wrong

 my timing always was lousy 
 how sweet 
 no matter what the british government says i wont kill this story miss oxford will show both of you to the elevator and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later 
 thank you uncle elliot 
 well i do believe this requires further investigation 
 i see 
 he brought that up from the wreck 
 but as i have explained to sidney without proof theres just no story dont you agree mr bond 
 i told you he was there 
 obviously the british government denies all of this 
 i see you two have met 
 what is he doing here 
 you come with me you stay here 
 take the men i can finish alone 
 a hundred and fifty years ago my ancestors took this island a barren lifeless rock and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization and now that im being forced to give it back i intend to return it in exactly the same condition a barren lifeless rock the gold is merely reparations payment from the spineless british government who wouldnt listen 
 you have to leave 
 hong kong mr bond

 yes sir but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division he has proposed an additional N million dollar payment 
 havent we already paid him for his services 
 i regret to inform you sir that saddam hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war 
 yes

 meaning there may be nuclear material down there 
 kim dae yung north korean nuclear specialist 
 who is it 
 oh no 
 one to seven deal the face cards 
 what about ids 
 here i am thinking about myself when poor harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen 
 soon as i rest a bit i meant as soon as we are back to normal again anytime 
 when are you boys going to fix that roof 
 they are too big 
 how come you are not wearing my shoes 
 yes 
 babe brother is that my shirt that you are wearing 
 oh here we go with that 
 junior spends time with his child 
 well you are his grandfather he is supposed to spend some time with you you are supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that 
 no its that when do you have time to be parents to him you guys dont pick him up until nine ten at night you are into yourselves as the saying goes spend some time trying to be parents take him to the mountains fishing you ought to let him get to know nature 
 why you dont want us to bring him over 
 we got the same thing 
 what did your wife get her 
 i hadnt forgotten i ordered some cloth but it didnt come in and i felt so bad if i would have come to her birthday without that i just stayed at home 
 your mother asked me not to mention it but your mothers birthday was last week 
 since when 
 i pay my own way 
 thats a lie 
 i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late 
 what time is it do you think you can just treat us like your slave its after one 
 what is it noontime 
 im cold i need to get out into the sunlight 
 we will take her you all stay here and watch dad 
 i will drive her to the hospital 
 my name is sam samuel 
 you dumb ass its babe brother 
 im leaving and dont even call me when the shoe falls cause all he did for me was to try and run my life im tired of people saying babe brother this babe brother that whats my name 
 i ought to break your damn neck 
 i told you about calling me boy i aint no boy see you and dad got a bad habit of calling me boy you call me boy in front of my wife you think im going to fix the roof i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain 
 that is a damn lie and you know it every time father asks you to do something you either halfass do it or run off and hide mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her with your smart ass self that you werent a farmer get junior to do it every time someone asks you to do something you always say tell junior to do it boy you ought to grow up 
 you always got the best of it around here and when dad always talks about my son it is always you so you fix the roof 
 i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof you would have rebuilt the whole damn house 
 i told her i would if she would give me time 
 why in the hell didnt you help mama 
 maybe i can get down there next week 
 robert asks about you when are you going to do something to help him 
 this is what it is all about trying to keep from being out on the street 
 this is not a good time to take chances your best friend robert an accountant lost his home and is out on the street we see him from time to time he comes down to church for a free meal 
 why are you always afraid to get somewhere 
 you want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours you know the last time we went into something together daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street 
 you always got something to say 
 you used that excuse to get out of the army 
 you all dont believe me when i tell you im afraid of heights 
 when are you going to find time to help me fix the roof 
 i guess it proves you really care about me you hung in there 
 and what lesson have we learned from all of this babe br sam i mean samuel 
 it was nip and tuck 
 do you think you won 
 i couldnt believe the things i was doing it was like an internal struggle going on inside my body 
 you were in hell 
 it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like 
 like muddy waters 
 its like i have been swimming in muddy waters 
 like a veil has been lifted 
 i have more sense than to give up everything my family you and sunny it wasnt me i mean the real me inside my body im glad its over its like a veil has been lifted 
 im okay go back to your friends 
 you okay 
 why in the h 
 linda how come you dont see that sunny puts his shoes on right 
 i dont need that kind of love and i dont want to be reminded all the time that big mamas grandmother was born in slavery if you really care about me just tell me how i can make money 
 he is just being like all parents concerned about the ones they love 
 why does he always pick on me 
 i preached to mom and dad about it but they are stuck in their ways its like talking to a brick but if there is a way 
 we could borrow on that land and put the money to work 
 pops put big daddys farm in rhondas and sunnys name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it 
 i told him we might not need it if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property 
 will you still get the money from your father 
 you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does N N or N baths mean 
 i would like to finish reading this what would i talk about i havent read this months almanac i dont care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes they pride themselves in making life hard and thats not my cup of tea 
 why dont you come in for a while 
 how old are you 
 i dont see you crying about my drinking it 
 coffee is bad for anybody especially for a child 
 what is a sip of coffee going to do 
 i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had but he needs discipline and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it 
 my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it every summer the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddys farm we would get up with the chickens every summer the fence had to be repaired the barn needed a coat of paint we had to pip all of big mamas hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday for big daddy calluses and sweat were the mark of a man sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did 
 because you were spoiled dont try to spoil sunny 
 i do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start you have no right to complain to us about your not having enough you sit right there with your no manners self 
 cant i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong the world is not black and white show me one perfect person if you cant dont ask me to be 
 dont make me raise my hand to you you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction 
 im busy 
 have you lost your mind have you thought about your wife and child not to mention your sick father and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling 
 harry is coming to pick me up 
 i have heard some foolish things in my life 
 im going back home with harry 
 what for 
 i need to get my suitcase out of the garage 
 well you look better than you did yesterday 
 doesnt he look a whole of lot better 
 he will be alright 
 this doesnt make any sense you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air 
 i was hoping you came to the door instead of him it gets cold at night 
 babe brother 
 who is it 
 we are going where the action is aint that right okra lets play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up what would you give to be rich 
 this would be a bad time for me to leave 
 i dont want to wear out welcome but you can stay in someones heart longer than you can stay in their house come with us boy we are going to have a good time 
 i heard his voice as clear as day i better get back maybe something is wrong 
 you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there 
 i could swear i heard my son call me 
 anytime you need someone to do something for you just let me know 
 son would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom my hand is too weak and would you do me another favor i dont like asking this but would you clean the tub for me i have trouble bending over 
 son i can take everything you got with that deck it is marked now im going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere 
 it is just a regular card 
 never play with someones elses cards you always get a new deck look at this card see anything 
 boy that is the real south that is real corn liquor 
 what is that 
 i dont know what happened to him he just ran out into the streets i got some old records i want you to hear i like the blues sung simply man and a guitar or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life dont ever let anyone tell you his lifes story if it is of a weary life full of sadness when i was a boy a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and i will be damned if the same thing didnt happen to me 
 dont pick up the cards if you are not in the game did he die 
 that is called a crab apple switch its for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog now i dont know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folks stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home i was up in memphis working on the railroad like your daddy who had an easy job he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon sure enough it was emory my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it got in a blues band and what not he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face bad luck i would say he got to drinking that corn liquor we went to his girls room and he wouldnt stop drinking he started talking about the old days and he went mad he pulled his knife and i got to mine first the lights went out 
 did you ever have to use this thing 
 im not here to argue sir 
 now how far would further out be 
 well you just have to move further out 
 we grow most of our own food the money i get from social security my pension and my wifes work keeps us living on the edge what choice do people like us have 
 not anymore not in the city 
 i always had chickens ducks and whatnots 
 you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock 
 its only a tale 
 i dont care to hear any jokes about people being in hell this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at 
 but these are white people anybody the punch 
 i dont want to hear any tales about colored people 
 im almost finished im about to come to the punch line 
 i dont want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell you are being irreverent 
 hes going to check out heaven first he gets a round trip ticket to heaven he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home people dripping with sweat working in the fields hardly surviving he asked a man who was getting a drink of water i thought the streets were paved with gold they are but you wont see them he said boy you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back picking their teeth man this is a dream he asked whats you will doing they all hollered back sinning the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said please to meet you he asked i thought you will was supposed to be burning in fire someone said man aint no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth 
 its healing now

 gideon dont say things like that 
 i wouldnt care if i drop dead if he learn something from it son you make me wish i was dead 
 you better be careful you will get a stroke arguing 
 no im too hot now

 well its up to suzie 
 babe brother is a poor boy 
 you know babe brothers wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them 
 you are going to find yourself on the floor 
 im trying to make him a man but you keep babying him 
 hush 
 you are always taking his side 
 hush 
 he aint nothing like me how come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart you ought to stop protecting him 
 you and babe brother are so much alike 
 im not going to let him get away with murder 
 you all act like two roosters 
 i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes 
 go back to sleep 
 your feet are cold 
 look dont try to get ahead by riding our backs 
 let us settle this tomorrow 
 i dont know how two brothers can be so different 
 dont bother the poor boy it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are 
 babe brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation i hate to be mean to people but picking sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end now im going to ask him how come he couldnt be at your birthday 
 everyone is gone rhonda is in the bathroom 
 my mind plays tricks on me is it okay if i take a bath now 
 i tell you i feel like a ghost 
 boy i thought you were about to cross the river 
 it hasnt been the years its been the men in her life 
 havent the years been good to hattie 
 course you could be right your sons are alive all my sons are dead 
 my daddy called me boy up to the time he died i was always boy to him 
 you still call him boy you call babe brother boy in front of his wife and son 
 you are suppose to teach your children what you know junior i dont have to worry about babe brother is a different story 
 everyone has to follow his own plough a man doesnt have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays city people dont give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays you dont plant old ways but at the end you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you its when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they dont want it you sell it to a stranger you worked your whole life for what i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm all what we have experienced has no meaning 
 i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior 
 course it is your business but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy 
 you and babe brother hit it off so well 
 everything these days is made overseas 
 what could have caused this i just changed this damn thing 
 it was slow now it seems like everyone is having births at home 
 how often is your wife called to help delivery 
 well i would appreciate that 
 oh i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you i havent wrung a chickens neck in a month of sundays you know folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs that used to be my trade from time to time 
 i was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner but time got away 
 next time when i feel a little better perhaps 
 you ought to come hear our preacher remember old cat iron well our preacher is just as strong 
 good morning 
 im going to wash up now you all please excuse me 
 its the boy next door throwing at his birds im just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window 
 thats awful generous of you i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome 
 man act like this is your home 
 well if you are sure i wont be a bother oh i dont sleep on no spring mattress i always make myself a pallet on the floor 
 man put your boxes down and stay as long as you like we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out 
 im worn out but wont you feel like you are taking in a stranger 
 stay until you feel better i would like to hear all the news 
 my feet have never been on anything that wasnt directly attached to the ground 
 why didnt you catch a plane 
 i came all the way from detroit by bus going to oakland the bus stopped in los angeles i had to get off and take a rest i will catch the last bus leaving at midnight im just too tired to go on 
 he knows better sunny apologize to harry 
 boy that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom 
 he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age 
 this is my grandson sunny he is my youngest sons child 
 only if you are a good man a friend are you a friend 
 you invited me 
 im glad you brought that up as to who you are i have to know who is in my house 
 i dont make no bones about where im going to spend eternity i have always been wild and you know that if you are made to feel half a man what do you think the other half is 
 hattie is a different person now 
 since she has repented all she does is throw stones 
 you must have done something to her 
 as god is my witness i have never done anything to that woman 
 good afternoon to you 
 good afternoon ladies 
 i made a fresh pot of coffee okra and i thought you need a rest i will stand guard okra wants to talk to you anyway 
 as long as he keeps his throat clear he is able to get some rest 
 how is he doing 
 only if you can spare it 
 let me get you a cup 
 that smells like fresh coffee 
 you just run along i will fix him his soup he will be all right 
 can you watch gideon for a while one of the girls is going into labor junior is going to drive me over 
 let me earn my keep i will go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot try to make him some cow tea next time 
 he has never gotten rid of the malaria he is usually up and at it the next day im going to make him fresh chicken broth 
 i hope that its nothing serious 
 he wasnt able to get out of bed today 
 ah you young folks dont know how it is how is gideon today 
 tolerable well 
 how is everybody 
 she has a fish bone caught in her throat could all of you go in the other room gideon get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil 
 whats the problem here 
 you got to know everything do everything and be everything 
 harry you know everything 
 i will be right there 
 i have someone i want you to meet 
 all those places that us coloreds lived that we used to call bottoms have all been changed to drives and heights everything is in what you call it not in what it is 
 i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him 
 you remember that boy who lost his mind joe you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark he wouldnt miss a one make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe he would pick up a brick and say go on in there brick and hit somebody and it would find its mark 
 those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person 
 where we come from you had to know how to act right you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir you had to know your place 
 one can tell you are from back home these people nowadays dont know what manners are 
 no if i rest any longer i wont sleep tonight may i use your bathroom to wash up a bit 
 you should go back and rest 
 good evening it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary 
 well i dont want to put you out 
 stranger my foot it was my grandmother who helped you into this world 
 emory had made a lot of enemies he had a big mouth 
 you damn right they didnt especially emory my cousin 
 those boys never did have good luck 
 chick was outright killed by a mob he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town 
 i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick 
 strange as it may seem it might have cleared the waters sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason 
 hockers death almost caused a race riot a lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that 
 what difference does it make if its persimmon oak tree or huckleberry bush 
 you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree 
 wasnt hocker lynched 
 miss claras boy emory to start with the johnsons hocker was another one 
 now who are we talking about 
 there is something that i always wanted to know tell me how did those boys die 
 oh i wasnt pointing my finger at you hey you have to think of yourself a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep there are too many bad people out there 
 i dont know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times 
 of course not have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people no you aint you have to take just one and fatten him up when you spread help too thin you you just nickel and dime the situation if you try to save all all die but if you save one life life goes on you just have to remember medicine that works leaves a bitter taste 
 week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger we cant feed all the hungry 
 good god almighty bless your bones but the problem grows 
 last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals 
 how many people do you all feed 
 well you and your husband are special ya gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor 
 thats nice 
 a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days 
 i already have my dear 
 in the meantime harry can slaughter us a hog 
 oh im sorry gideon what do you say 
 is this your house 
 speaking of tappy heads we ought to have an old fashion fish fry 
 an empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you tappy head you aint worth the salt you put in greens 
 out of weariness i spoke to my own heart to leave it all and to die and i gave my heart to know madness and folly 
 i was quoting from the bible if the shoe fits wear it 
 now i was trying to be nice to make conversation since we go back some 
 you know the saying your heart is in your left hand 
 that is a boy from home lullas brother 
 none of your business 
 my mother passed on years ago 
 i know your mother aint still operating that house of hers 
 some people grow up and change their ways 
 why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone i remember when you werent saved that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road 
 harry thats not nice im in church now 
 no im a different person now harry 
 girl do you still sing and dance 
 i couldnt believe it when suzie called and said you were staying here how have you been 
 you never know whats in the heart and just because you can cry doesnt make you human 
 all the people working with us are really doing it cause they hate to see suffering 
 ya but you cant do the shuffle with one leg you and your wife in your spare time work with the less fortunate now im not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying 
 he should be caring that is not too much to ask 
 well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance dont take me wrong but you cant judge people by how you act you are a caring person 
 i appreciate you lending me a hand that lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me 
 country people got so many strange ways 
 juniors wife kept her afterbirth in the refrigerator thats why i do not eat over there now 
 some folks take that natural stuff too far 
 no no no no i had my child at cedars and sinai and that aint no county hospital you have to have cash or check before you come in the door 
 did you have your child at home 
 in some things when we were children there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didnt have something on you that didnt make a x 
 i thought you werent old fashioned 
 you dont want to be at crossroads without one its a charm that old people teach you how to make i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child in my travels i misplaced it i have been looking over my shoulder ever since 
 whats a toby 
 i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago 
 i think he wants to see your rabbit foot 
 not you mustnt touch your mama might not like you handling knives 
 oh im more modern in my ways i dont believe in sin though there is good and evil and evil is a thing you work at 
 you dont act like the rest of gideons friends they believe if you are not hard at work you are hard at sin 
 if it was left up to me i would poison him 
 what must i do 
 everybody who have been associated with harry end up with pennies over their eyes 
 i cant accuse him just dry long N 
 hes just raffish harry put him up to it before evening sun sets i would have his belongings back on route N that old fox 
 i asked harry about it he didnt own up to it he said he didnt know what got into okra 
 rush your mouth girl no he didnt he cannot be that big of a damn fool 
 you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening 
 harry always shows his good side and like the moon the other side is black back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman im telling you harry is nothing but evil im warning you you cant keep a wild animal as a pet around children 
 i remember harry always trying to help someone he got lullas daughter out of trouble he was always running to the store for someone who couldnt leave the house 
 you know harry lied about how that boy hocker got kilt and it was harry who saw emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog 
 i havent heard anyone mention swamp root since buttonup shoes went out 
 no but i might have some indian chief tonic 
 whether the boy hears it or not the man is still a jackass everyone should have some mother wit 
 you shouldnt talk about the boys father in front of him this is family business and we have to pull together 
 i want to hear what happened my brother is a jackass and a damn fool the both of you have been as scarce as hens teeth 
 now you dont have to say anything if you dont want to 
 where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends they all smell of moth balls 
 harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock 
 he just leeches off your parents he is a master at wearing out welcome 
 dont shout 
 when did you talk to harry 
 why not harry says thats the only way to do good 
 we cant really bring another family in here with us 
 you know the man next door is near death 
 im sorry he got those birds 
 he is in his pigeon cage 
 where is skip 
 i was just trying to make conversation 
 counting the what what does that have to do with the price of butter 
 counting the gray hairs in your head

 is there anything else i should know about him

 no of course not shes one of the top students at her school 
 is she in any kind of therapy professional help 
 i i dont really know 
 i mean did you ask her what kind of drugs has she tried 
 i dont know what you mean 
 one thing bothers me that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him serious amounts hes lucky he lived so i gotta ask whats your daughter on 
 like i said open container pi misdemeanor possession easy to make it disappear for you poof its gone 
 still this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally 
 judge wakefield its an honor to handle it for you consider it gone away shes a minor it probably would have expunged on her N th birthday anyway 
 i appreciate you coming in so early 
 you will believe me because its true 
 i want to believe you i really do 
 if manolo hadnt gone and told them what he did then salazar and madrigal would never have been brought to justice he did a great thing for tijuana he did a great thing for mexico 
 well you know hes going to say about madrigal and salazar 
 what is he planning on telling them 
 nine thousand dollars 
 how much 
 he has debts he has gambling debts he owes a lot of money 
 why does he need money 
 its very hard for me to come and tell you this 
 what what is it 
 no 
 he never came home last night was he with you 
 hes not here 
 i cant find manolo 
 anna whats wrong what do you want 
 hes right they will do it when you are walking somewhere make it look like street crime 
 even if that were true they are not going to come to your house where you are waiting for them 
 its the same what happened to what they gave you 
 its the same stuff from the rainy day stash 
 what are you thinking calling me at home with a message like that you have compromised me and our relationship 
 did you get it 
 i cant do that 
 i need an introduction to the obregon brothers 
 helena 
 i know i made things worse i know that and im sorry but arnie i need something from you something only you can help me with 
 helena please this is out of your hands 
 that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us 
 have you gone crazy you are not carl you arent as good as carl they are moving the trial to a high security location the press has gone berserk the jury will be influenced stay out of things let us try to win the case 
 i tried arnie and i will continue to try 
 that was a stupid thing you did incredibly stupid 
 im glad you think so but im picturing a debtridden thirtytwo yearold mother whose exhusband is being compared to pablo escobar and im wondering who would want to be with someone like that 
 i remember when i first met you little helen watts from the wrong side of somewhere i had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed 
 sometimes i wonder what i will do if carl doesnt get out im not very adept at being on my own i have always had a man in my life always 
 dont you have some good news isnt there something positive you could say 
 laundromats for the washing of money unfortunately carl had only one successful business 
 what about legitimate businesses we own a construction concern real estate 
 even if i knew i wouldnt tell you you do not want to come into contact with these people only carl knows who they are thats his real asset ruiz doesnt know them they dont know ruiz church and state 
 please tell me who carl sells to 
 yes i told you before there are people who owe you money but they are not paying theres too much heat on carl 
 arnie help me doesnt anyone owe us money 
 helena if i had it i would give it to you but i dont have that kind of money 
 arnie i need money somebody threatened my children they want a first payment of three million dollars 
 this place is swept twice a day i learned that in miami in N then the us shut down the whole caribbean but its a big game of wackamole knock it down in miami it pops up here and san diego is so much more relaxing 
 i suspect he will accept his payment in publicity 
 how much do i pay him 
 you are gonna get through it but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl we get adler and we beat this thing 
 if all our assets are frozen and our sales force has scattered how am i supposed to survive im giving birth in three months how do i get through this 
 of course he is i have known him for twenty years and he doesnt jaywalk 
 i am on the board of my sons school i had a fundraiser for alv in my front yard i have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman 
 thats a very apt analogy helena now go home and be with your children 
 arnie i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass 
 i dont know but under no circumstances would i talk about it here i want you to go home and relax the best you can continue your life as if nothing has happened that is very important 
 what is he being charged with 
 got it good do not discuss anything over the telephone do not talk to the neighbors stay out of your yard 
 arnie this is crazy 
 good from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be taperecorded that the movement of your lips is being read got it 
 listen to me carefully first of all carl isnt here deas got him and they will hang on to him until arraignment which will probably be tomorrow so here you are wasting your time are you with me 
 why are you talking like that 
 i understand you are upset you want to know whats going on thats good 
 arnie thank god 
 helena im so sorry 
 goodbye arnie 
 carl 
 arnie do think theres a difference between a reason and an excuse because i dont think there is 
 carl think about it if i was trying to rip you off i would have left town after ruiz was killed i wouldnt sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal 
 so my wife is lying 
 carl thats insane 
 you had it all figured out you move into my house you raise my kids you sleep with my wife it was a good plan arnie 
 i just didnt want to take a chance i didnt want to risk it it could have been frozen along with everything else 
 and you didnt feel like you could trust my wife with this news 
 i was just waiting for the right time 
 so arnie when were you going to tell me about the N million dollars we got in from san francisco two days after i got arrested 
 what 
 dont bother 
 carl im running late im coming right now 
 its saturday arnie you work too hard 
 she will be at a pawn shop in an hour 
 where are you going 
 at least shes alive 
 sos the video camera 
 my leicas gone 
 i dont know 
 god i dont get it are we supposed to say to ourselves be prepared to lose her be prepared to lose our child why does this happen to someone how does it happen 
 me too 
 about the other night im sorry 
 no not yet 
 should we bring the police into this 
 yeah because the alternative is to be bored to death 
 oh it is 
 i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day thats different 
 im not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello 
 yeah well she has a way of self medicating that probably seems familiar too 
 no i dont think so leave me alone give me money thats what i get from our daughter she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar 
 look im as worried as you are 
 if you start in on the war metaphors im going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole 
 the first thing we have to do is present a unified front 
 because im at the edge of my capabilities robert 
 barbara 
 you might want to pencil in a little facetime with your daughter 
 does this mean you are going to be gone more 
 i think we may have found our mexican drug czar its this general salazar at least i will have somebody on the other side i can talk to 
 she asked me not to 
 explain to me how you could think that i shouldnt know about this explain to me how this wouldnt be relevant to me as a parent 
 six months i found some marijuana thats all and a little pipe about two inches long i talked with her she said her friends smoked pot and drank 
 how long have you known 
 we dont want to push her away these are growing experiences 
 space for what to od like that other kid i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents because it isnt correct 
 i think she has to find out for herself on her own we have to allow her space 
 to begin with shes only sixteen yearsold 
 why 
 this is different 
 should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is 
 stop you experimented in college i dont want to hear about that 
 honey this is difficult but we have all had our moments i tried 
 we will ground her clip her wings a bit school and scheduled activities and thats it until further notice this has to be handled delicately dan kelly in the district attorneys office will probably help us out quietly christ this could be embarrassing 
 me too 
 i think shes lying 
 its so frustrating 
 thats frustrating 
 so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel none of whom had any expertise superfund is just one of those words people stop paying attention 
 drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world canada is completely overwhelmed 
 like a grateful dead concert 
 hes a friend hes also like the only one who was dealing with the situation hed definitely had a few beers but its not like he wanted to drive we didnt know what else to do it wasnt my pot 
 how well do you know this boy seth who was driving you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana 
 he didnt hang around us hes like one of those hippie kids im not part of that group it was a party in all these rooms his girlfriend who i barely know was completely hysterical hes blue hes puking we didnt want to get in trouble but what were we supposed to do i mean what would you have done if you had been us 
 what do you think 
 is this bad for him 
 i dont know 
 are you going to 
 not yet 
 did you tell dad 
 sorry but i mean come on 
 caroline 
 none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar 
 that makes mom the czarina im a czarette like anastasia 
 czar for life just like a real czar 
 honey your father knows the president 
 did you meet the president 
 tell me what to do carl i need guidance not a fucking platitude im not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with i wont do it i want our life back 
 helena 
 how supportive letters from prison while im being kicked out of our home do you have any idea what is happening out here our credit cards are maxed the people at the bank you should see their faces when i walk in there i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging nobody will help us nobody will take us in nobody wants anything to do with us so tell me carl how you are gonna make it up to me tell me again how we will get through this and maybe while you are at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection 
 we will get through this i promise i will make it up to you 
 we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents i dont even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you are coming back or if you are coming back

 what if every country legalized at the same time 
 fine legalization okay forgetting all of our international trade agreements legalize everything today the government inserts itself into all drug transactions the us becomes a giant pharmacy our borders are mobbed lines of people from here to europe wanting to smoke snort and shoot themselves into oblivion 
 what about legalizing everything has anybody talked about that 
 whats it like imagine you are being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta except the beggars are wearing $N suits and they dont say please or thank you

 i love my job i love it the next time im having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and i will get over it

 winners dont do coke or havent you been reading the bumper stickers 
 he won he was a winner that bothers you 
 maradona is a cokehead hand of god my ass we are wasting our time here 
 you should see little montel play little montel is the next maradona 
 you want to make a wager on this 
 so does half of san diego 
 she knows arnie metzger 
 im telling you she doesnt know shit 
 i have dreams about this actual dreams about busting the top people the rich people the white people 
 she aint in on it 
 they are whispering i cant hear them but i know it i smell conspiracy i feel the lie vibrating out of the home 
 who do you work for 
 thats a big word for a fisherman 
 we got you on tape making the deal we got you bragging about the quality we got you bragging about your business we got you 
 move em to texas fry em up 
 its a funny fuckin joke and its quick why do women wear makeup and perfume 
 chill out 
 nope 
 no more pissant basin league bullshit for us hunh 
 i feel good 
 no telltales nothing to read not touching my face not even blinking no giveaways how are you feeling 
 medicinal marijuana initiative or am i being cynical 
 arizona 
 depends on the state 
 what would a law firm want from the new drug czar 
 you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff three categories you like me you hate me you want something from me definitely third category 
 your friends at warren putnam and hudson 
 depends who its from 
 what do you think it is 
 yeah 
 womens room stall two should we stop for icecream 
 we are playing 
 david 
 especially tiger woods actually he keeps his on the back seat 
 not tiger woods 
 all the professionals keep them in the trunk 
 no 
 i will put this in the back 
 what are you a mouse get out of the car and do it this is your chance 
 they are going to walk right past me 
 theres always a way if people get to the pope or the president you can get to him 
 i dont know eduardo ruiz is the only real witness against carl the security is very tight there may not be a way 
 when will you do it 
 i dont really like guns you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive 
 you are kidding cant you shoot him or something 
 you were followed by the police but they wont hear us over the children i want to use a bomb 
 i have a job for you and i dont have much time 
 you may speak 
 im on a special phone may i speak freely 
 yes 
 you only got to me because you were tipped off by the juarez cartel whos trying to break into tijuana you are helping them you work for a drug dealer too monty 
 so go shower already 
 the worst thing about you monty is you realize the futility of what you are doing and you do it anyway i wish you could see how transparent you are this food tastes like shit 
 you are breaking my heart 
 cant you for a second imagine none of this had happened that my drugs had gone through what would have been the harm a few people get high who are getting high anyway your partner is still alive we avoid having breakfast together dont you see this means nothing that your whole life is pointless 
 that thought makes me feel awful 
 you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder 
 when the dea gets into the narcotics business then we will stay at the four seasons 
 this is ridiculous why is there no elevator 
 carl and i were friends from childhood he was loyal thats not a mistake 
 he hired you that was a mistake 
 i got greedy i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off that was my mistake carl would never be so stupid 
 this attitudes not gonna help him any is it 
 in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity this is not so true for the usa using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search the odds are not high and we found variables that reduce the odds we hire drivers with nothing to lose then we throw a lot of product at the problem some get stopped enough get through its not difficult 
 so you pay off our customs officials 
 carlos i mean carl started out in the family connection business real estate in tijuana fishing boats out of ensenada hydroponic raspberries he met up with the obregon brothers of the tijuana cartel who were interested in two things entering society and using his fishing boats 
 we can protect you 
 its a death sentence i will never make it to the trial 
 one chance here eduardo make us believe you got a boss no boss its all on you 
 the amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states 
 you cant visit me here i want my lawyer 
 listen you motherfucker you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon 
 i am a legitimate business fishing boats tuna check it out tax records everything 
 you planning on going somewhere eduardo you dont like it here this is the best situation you are going to have for a long long time 
 nobody said shit eduardo 
 so its worth the wait right what can i do rent a huey have an airlift its not like you can put it in a condom up some mules asshole right how many peasants would that take a line stretching from here to mexico city 
 you will dine with me from now on 
 i dont know sir 
 bring this man a change of good clothes has he eaten 
 yes sir 
 we arent barbarians 
 yes sir 
 i want to know who is responsible for this treatment 
 deliver that safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal 
 you will help me with my other problem 
 exactly and this is how i know im not getting into business with the us government 
 thats crazy my husband is on trial for smuggling 
 take this back with you deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal 
 perhaps perhaps im afraid i must first ask you to pass a test i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors 
 it should be its yours i want our debt forgiven i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states and i want the principle witness against my husband eduardo ruiz killed 
 thats good coke 
 fine then we dont have a deal 
 fine then we dont have deal 
 im six months pregnant i wont do it 
 you first 
 i dont believe you 
 every part from his ears to his accessory belt is highimpact pressuremolded cocaine odorless undetectable by dogs undetectable by anyone 
 not in 
 you want to smuggle narcotics in mr espastico jacobo thats nothing new 
 we have the ability to change the color odor and physical property of cocaine 
 i dont know perhaps i remember something 
 my husband had been working on something he called the project for the children are you aware of this 
 but not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt 
 there are plenty of other suppliers in mexico 
 you dont listen to this woman in a mans world a very violent world 
 i dont think you are going to do that 
 that is not true mrs ayala your route is compromised perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california 
 my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization not ours 
 i hear these stories your husband in jail his business in chaos various people fighting over the scraps 
 why do you say that mr marquez 
 no this is not possible and i thank you for coming down here though i suspect its been a pointless journey 
 yes he threatened to kill my five yearold son i was under the impression i would be meeting juan obregon 
 we keep our mouths shut 
 javi come on dont pull this you dont care bullshit this is incredible information it must be javi 
 porfirio madrigal is not dead i just saw him 
 what 
 madrigals alive 
 go home get cleaned up get to work salazar is heading down to mexico city next week and im not getting left behind dont fuck this up 
 no but a lot of other people you should come you should come out with us 
 oh really general salazar was there 
 its no problem i was just with everybody we work with 
 not this time 
 yeah it should be fun you wanna come 
 your new friends 
 guzman tomas esteban 
 who 
 a group of us are going out tonight 
 then i guess im going by myself 
 this is fucking crazy instead of killing us he sends us on a suicide mission do you know who frankie flowers is hes a psychocokehead hitman a faggot hes killed fucking who knows how many people youd need half the force to get close to him and you cant get their help because he lives in fucking san diego 
 the police wont find your car 
 please filing a report will not help you find your car 
 anyway i dont think we will ever see them again everythings back to normal 
 shes nosy she hears me on the telephone 
 if you want her to stay out of it then stop telling her everything you should learn how to keep a secret 
 they wouldnt do it in front of all these people theyd send someone later when we are alone 
 relax if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert 
 i dont know something 
 whats he doing up here 
 yeah 
 wasnt that general salazar 
 i feel like a traitor 
 you should feel good about this 
 this is a very different proposition 
 we thought maybe youd have that kind of information for us 
 so maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations 
 we agree 
 its important that we work together mexico america one hand washing the other 
 no 
 a place we have that we know is protected 
 where 
 somewhere safe 
 when he loves me like a father he will never tell anyone he was here he will freely give the names of his superiors then we get them and they too will give us names and eventually somebody will get us to juan obregon and the cartel will fall 
 but will he be housetrained 
 you watch and learn i earn his trust then more pain then i appear with kindness within a week he will follow me around like a dog 
 everybody has a weakness 
 im curious how you did this with such economy 
 he will do what i say 
 only if he can be trusted 
 does this offer include my partner 
 a small thing nothing really 
 what is it you want me to do 
 im trying to bust the tijuana cartel 
 if i can 
 thats your past i want to talk about your future would you be willing to do something for me 
 it was an anonymous tip 
 what is the name of your informant 
 an informant 
 one question how did you find about this 
 well javier rodriguez you have done a very good job but we will take care of it from here 
 javier rodriguez 
 whats your name 
 is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who isnt connected in some war to one of the cartels 
 its possible 
 that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power 
 it could mean that yes 
 let me ask you a hypothetical question if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel and he went out of power would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence 
 so whats it doing in tijuana 
 im aware of that 
 the cocaine brand N is an east coast brand a juarez cartel brand and you must know it usually comes through into el paso 
 if i ever return to the bench counselor adler i hope i have the pleasure of hearing your arguments 
 i hope when you were on the bench judge wakefield you didnt handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion 
 last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country 
 noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the us government so no i dont have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government fighting people like you trying to keep this system a little bit honest 
 noriega is a criminal 
 we kidnapped noriega out of panama is that covered in your constitution because it isnt in mine 
 michael you represent drug dealers not civil libertarians 
 the worst serial killer in history who gacy right killed forty two people our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day 
 which part getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities 
 my work keeps me young 
 right but thats not the biggest problem one of our intel officers picked up information from dea that traffickers have come up with a process a chemical process to turn coke into something else it doesnt smell like coke it doesnt look like coke and whats worse it doesnt react to field test it could be anything maybe its already happening i mean how would we know 
 that triple the amount of stuff is going through 
 sure more money in intelligence on their side of the border so we have a better idea who we are looking for more dogs more people supposed to be getting some giant x ray machines to run the trucks through outside of martial law thats about the best you are gonna do but i should tell you there are two things that really have us on edge right now in the last six months seizures have tripled even though we are pulling over the same number of cars what does that tell you 
 any way we can do it better 
 we ask questions and measure the answers when something doesnt ring true a fact that doesnt make sense a slight hesitation then its off to secondary for a closer look before nafta we had about N million trucks a year now its almost double pretty soon there will be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies 
 what do you look for 
 i have read official estimates but i wouldnt bet my house on them i have heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractortrailers at least a halfdozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope with drivers employed by people who dont give a damn if they are caught or not 
 any idea how much 
 the busiest land border crossing in the world over fortyone thousand vehicles per day twentytwo thousand pedestrians on foot i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through 
 just tell me where she is 
 i want your money i will take your money 
 i will pay you a thousand dollars i have it in my wallet 
 i got money 
 i have money 
 who the fuck do you think you are where the fuck do you think you are why the fuck do you think i shouldnt just put you in a dumpster 
 i need to find my daughter i will pay you 
 this is a business get the fuck outta here 
 im looking for my daughter caroline she comes here 
 hey man back the fuck up to this place whats that shit right now all over this country a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see you got any drugs you know where i can get drugs what kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person on their possibilities if you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood indian hills and they asked every white person they saw hey you got any drugs within a day your friends and their kids would be selling its market forces man the products marked up three hundred percent you can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day you think white people would still be going to law school 
 i cant believe you used to bring my daughter here to this place 
 i dont know maybe we missed her 
 you want to help stay the fuck away from her 
 hey man im sorry im just trying to help 
 you dont know what the hell you are talking about you are a cocky seventeen yearold and you dont have a clue what the stakes are you dont know the value of the life you have yet to throw away and neither does she 
 the west end we buy it off the streets i can stop you know and she cant two people really similar we can talk about anything but for me its like a weekend thing then i get my shit together and for her its different 
 what 
 we sometimes went downtown to score

 addicts treat themselves they overdose and then theres one less to worry about 
 let me ask you a related question we have talked about the supply side but what about demand what is your policy for treating addiction 
 yes i hope so as well 
 hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem 
 yes i am confident that juan obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year but you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force we get a tip that he is one place then we get there and he is already gone having been warned by someone on our side 
 you have been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel 
 that would be very helpful to me also i received the offer from dea and the fbi to train some of my men at quantico i think this will be extremely useful a good way for us to absorb some of your methods 
 id like to bring you up to washington walk you around our side of things and share some of the information we have been able to develop on your cartels 
 i recruited the best men in mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process not only physical but also psychological

 what i thought madrigal was dead i thought it was verified 
 salazars been taken down he was working for porfirio madrigal 
 im sorry did i wake you 
 hello 
 i see where you are going with that but if i could just say something which is basically that a guy like landry is so autocratic he doesnt know how to let himself be helped its a point of pride to take every bullet no matter who fired it or whether it was even aimed at him which personally i think it very selfdefeating now dont get me wrong hes a man of enormous integrity but theres a political component to this job that the general just didnt have any patience for 
 like you protected landry 
 i just want to be clear about one thing i used to work for him but now i work for you im not a partisan person im an issue person in the next few weeks if you allow me we will get you wellversed on an incredible array of issues the most important of which in my opinion being mexico i know everybody that you are gonna meet its important that they like you its not important that they like me thats why i can help protect you 
 i dont know i dont think theres any one person see the problem is the juarez cartel owns everything and everybody all the property on the mexican side sometimes all the property on both sides warehouses transportation even tunnels its very organized 
 i mean who runs interdiction on the mexico side 
 what do you mean 
 who do we interface with on their side 
 right now its used by somebody from the juarez cartel one of his lieutenants who knows every damn day theres birthday party at first i thought they must have three hundred children then i realized they are taunting us three miles away and we cant touch them ha ha ha

 i will come back if you like but im not promising anything 
 what

 its where i live 
 wheres that 
 im going home 
 where are you going diane 
 diane 
 whats your name 
 thanks 
 excuse me i dont mean to harass you but i was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation i thought to myself shes special 
 he forgot useless motherfucker 
 what happened 
 what and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him did i tell you about my birthday 
 actually its a nightmare i have been desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun you should try it with tommy 
 its an interesting theory 
 i read it in cosmopolitan 
 i didnt either what the fuck is it 
 exactly im not wanting a cat she says get to fuck right so theres tommy stuck with this kitten you can imagine what happened the thing was neglected pissing and shitting all over the place tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers he didnt know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit 
 i bet lizzy told him where to put it 
 eh hows that 
 no toxoplasmosis sort of like a stroke 
 what was it pneumonia or cancer 
 tommy knew he had the virus like but never knew hed gone fullblown 
 returned it where to the video shop tommy to the fucking video store so every punter in edinburgh is jerking off to our video god tommy i feel sick 
 it will be here somewhere i might have returned it by mistake 
 what do you mean its gone where has it gone tommy 
 fuck ok 
 yes i want to watch ourselves while we are screwing 
 now 
 tommy lets put the tape on 
 exactly those very words have been my guiding light in what is after all a dark and often hostile world 
 strive hope believe and conquer 
 of course the motto the motto 
 do you recall the school motto 
 oh really 
 im an old boy myself you know 
 oh yes indeed i look back on my time there with great fondness and affection the debating society the first eleven the soft know of willow on leather 
 one of edinburghs finest schools 
 indeed yes those halcyon days 
 well mr renton i see that you attended the royal edinburgh college 
 the pleasure was mine best interview i have ever been to thanks 
 thank you mr murphy we will let you know 
 hey right no problem whatever you say man you are the man the governor the dude in the chair like im merely here but obviously i am here that is i hope im not talking too much i dont usually i think its all important though isnt it 
 you were referred here by the department of employment theres no need for you to get you foot in the door as you put it 
 only to get my foot in the door showing initiative right 
 mr murphy do you mean that you lied on your application 
 no actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you wouldnt have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead because they are both schools right and we are all in this together and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details yeah people get all hung up on details but whats the point like which school does it matter why when where or how many o grades did i get could be six could be one but thats not important whats important is that i am right that i am 
 spud they are my sheets 
 id really rather take care of it myself 
 no problem for me either honestly its no problem 
 its no problem 
 theres no need 
 no i will wash them i will take them home and bring them back 
 i will put the sheets in the washing machine just now 
 sorry about last night 
 morning spud sit down and have some breakfast 
 no problem no problem easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood 
 thanks mark 
 well sub us then mate im expecting a rent cheque

 no me neither 
 no 
 following the game at all 
 no 
 are you getting out much 
 would not say no would not say no 
 another dab 
 a little too well if anything a little too well thats my only fear compadre 
 try this 
 my problem is that i tend to clam up i go dumb and i cant answer any questions at all nerves on the big occasion like a footballer 
 its a tightrope spud a fucking tightrope 
 nightmare 
 exactly 
 and you might get the fucking job 
 but try too hard 
 right 
 if they think you are not trying you are in trouble first hint of that they will be on to the dss this cunts no trying and your giro is fucking finished right 
 yeah 
 now remember 
 cheers 
 good luck spud 
 sorry boys i dont have two thousand pounds 
 come on mark every cunt knows you have been saving up down in london 
 thats tough 
 we are two thousand short 
 but you dont have the money 
 four grand 
 what was your price 
 so we have just come from tommys funeral and you are telling me about a skag deal 
 so he met me and i offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy i know in london 
 so 
 about four kilos so he tells me got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week where he met two russian sailors they are fucking carrying the stuff for sale there and then like so he wakes up the next morning realizes what hes done and get very fucking nervous wants rid of this 
 how much 
 theres a mate of swanneys mikey forrester you know the guy hes come into some gear a lot of gear 
 what 
 it was just an idea 
 why would i want to sell my passport 
 well this guy i have met runs a hotel brother loads of contacts does a nice little sideline in punting british passports to foreigners get you a good price 
 why 
 well christ if id known you were going to get so humpty about it i wouldnt have bothered are you going to eat that 
 it was my fucking television 
 i got a good price for it rents i need the money 
 i cant believe you did that 
 and i will tell you why because im fed up to my back teeth with losers nohopers draftpacks schemies junkies and the like im getting on with life what are you doing 
 fuck you 
 i know a couple of addicts stupid wee lassies i feed them what they need a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull its easy money for me not exactly a fortune but im thinking i should be coining it here less whores more skag swanneys right get clean get into dealing thats where the future lies set up some contacts get a good load of skag punt it profit what do you think 
 you are all hear 
 fuck you ok so tommys got the virus bad news big deal the gig goes on or hadnt you noticed swanney fucks his leg up well tough shit but it could have been worse 
 you are a real mate and what about tommy have you been to see him yet 
 dont know maybe thursday 
 when are you going to visit him 
 cut it out 
 and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off 
 god you are sick 
 he made me lick it 
 oh no dont even mention it 
 no he didnt make me touch it 
 you know 
 what 
 did he you know 
 it wasnt that bad 
 eughh sounds horrible 
 im cooking up there is a silence 
 say something mark say something 
 it wasnt my baby she wasnt my baby baby dawn she wasnt mine spuds swanneys sick boys i dont know maybe allison knew maybe not i wished i could think of something to say something sympathetic something human 
 oh fuck sick boy reaches out to allison 
 whats wrong allison 
 i think allison had been screaming all day but it hadnt really registered before she might have been screaming for a week for all i knew its been days since i have heard anyone speak though surely someone must have said something in all that time surely to fuck someone must have 
 clear enough moneypenny this should present no significant problem 
 do you see the beast have you got it in you sights 
 give me the gun 
 yeah beautifully fucking illustrated 
 thats your theory 
 yeah 
 right so we all get old and then we cant hack it any more is that it 
 that means fuck all the sympathy vote 
 despite the academy award 
 i dont rate that at all 
 what about the untouchables 
 all im trying to do is help you understand that the name of the rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory 
 ok ok so whats the point you are trying to make 
 charlie nicholas david niven malcolm mclaren elvis presley 
 so who else 
 no its not bad but its not great either is it and in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right its actually just shite 
 some of his solo stuffs not bad 
 well at one time you have got it and then you lose it and its gone for ever all walks of life george best for example had it and lost it or david bowie or lou reed 
 what do you mean 
 its certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life 
 roald dahl fuck me 
 roald dahl 
 who wrote it 
 tomorrow afternoon usual setup 
 the park 
 and i wondered if youd care to go to the park tomorrow 
 you dont know do you 
 but you are looking better it has to be said healthier radiant even 
 who wrote it 
 you can look it up 
 ok so who was it then 
 fuck off he never wrote any of them 
 eh ian fleming 
 screenwriter 
 lewis gilbert 
 director 
 one hundred and sixteen minutes 
 running time 
 nineteensixtyseven 
 you only live twice 
 the only drawback or at least the principal drawback is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that 
 i would say in those days he was a muscular actor in every sense with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead closer in that respect to cary grant 
 people think its all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite which is not to be ignored but what they forget spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it otherwise we wouldnt do it after all we are not fucking stupid at least we are not that fucking stupid take the best orgasm you ever had multiply it by a thousand and you are still nowhere near it when you are on junk you have only one worry scoring when you are off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite got no money cant get pished got money drinking too much cant get a bird no chance of a ride got a bird too much hassle you have to worry about bills about food about some football team that never fucking wins about human relationships and all the things that really dont matter when you have got a sincere and truthful junk habit 
 goldfingers better than dr no both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office in which field of course thunderball was a notable success 
 i chose not to choose life i chose something else and the reasons there are no reasons who need reasons when you have got heroin 
 sure will pal sure will 
 you will have to send us a postcard 
 yeah 
 sounds great swanney 
 the strategy is this get clean get mobile get into dealing and this time next year i will be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon 
 sure 
 and see when i get out of here i have got plans going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand where women really know how to treat a guy see out there you can live like a king if you have got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket no fucking problem 
 great 
 as you wish 
 no thank you i will proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs please 
 in that case 
 regret to inform sir that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago

 and would sir care to settle his bill in advance 
 why thank you 
 your usual table sir 
 excellent 
 your favourite dish 
 whats on the menu this evening 
 to see you through the night that lies ahead 
 no i dont think so 
 you will need one more hit 
 thats hardly a substitute 
 he knows a lot about sean connery 
 hes always been lacking in moral fibre 
 yeah well it surely worked for him 
 the sick boy method 
 sure sure i have heard it before 
 im going to get it right this time going to get it set up and get off it for good 
 well its up to you 
 yeah no more im finished with that shite 
 are you serious 
 from time to time even i have uttered the magic words 
 doesnt it make you proud to be scottish 
 look tommy we know you are getting a hard time off lizzy but theres no need to take it out on us 
 its fresh air 
 its really nice tommy can we go home now 
 its the great outdoors 
 are you serious 
 there 
 such as sitting in a darkened room watching videos drinking smoking dope and wanking does that answer your question 
 such as 
 if im giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket im just saying it had better be good theres plenty of other things i could be doing 
 it will be it will make a change for three miserable junkies who dont know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack 
 this had better be good 
 i dont know tommy i dont know if its normal 
 well what are you waiting for 
 but where 
 a walk 
 what 
 we go for a walk 
 well i have paid for the ticket 
 so whats it going to be 
 big time absolutely fucking radge its me or iggy pop time to decide 
 went ballistic

 thats fair enough 
 useless motherfucker thats what she called me i told her im sorry but theses things happen lets put it behind us 
 i have got balls like watermelons im telling you 
 six weeks and no sex 
 she read it in cosmopolitan 
 where did she come up with that 
 its a nightmare she told me she didnt want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in 
 six weeks 
 six weeks 
 how long is it 
 no joy yet 
 hows it going with gail 
 no well yes i have to admit it im a perfectionist for me its the best or nothing at all if things go badly i cant be bothered but i have a good feeling about this interview seems to me like its gone pretty well we have touched on a lot of subjects a lot of things to think about for all of us 
 mr murphy do you see yourself as having any weaknesses 
 no not homeless people beggars francis begbie one of my mates i wouldnt say my best mate i mean sometimes the boy goes over the score like one time when we me and him were having a laugh and all of a sudden hes fucking gubbed me in the face right 
 homeless people 
 i love people all people even people that no one else loves i think they are ok you know like beggars 
 what do you see as your main strengths 
 it runs deep share it with me 
 my pain 
 i couldnt help but notice you pain 
 bring it closer so that i might join with it do it or watch these puny things die horribly 
 the ship 
 bring me the ship or i will destroy you 
 no no its not possible 
 he doubts me 
 why why have you done this to my friend 
 you doubt me 
 he has his doubts 
 it will be your chariot 
 then i shall make use of this starship 
 it could yes 
 this starship could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier 
 with a starship 
 and how did you breach the barrier 
 we sought only your infinite wisdom 
 magnificent you are the first to find me 
 it was not the barrier stood between us but we breached it 
 it is i the journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one 
 qual se tu 
 dont worry fellas your secrets` safe with me i will send the shuttlecraft to pick you up 
 sulu look the suns come out its a miracle 
 my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees 
 is there a problem gentlemen 
 dont tell them you are lost you will never live it down 
 return to prearranged coordinates for pickup 
 rescued at last 
 bad news gentlemen shore leaves been cancelled 
 but captain we are firing directly on your position 
 in firing position torpedo armed 
 estimating destination in N hours present speed 
 following new course warp seven 
 pavel 
 new course you have no authority whats going on here 
 plotting our new course 
 sulu what are you doing 
 and we cant see a thing request you direct us to the coordinates 
 um yes we have been caught in a blizzard 
 all right we are lost but we are making good time 
 admit it we are lost 
 i dont have a clue 
 whats emergency landing plan b 
 do it go to red alert 
 but the shuttle 
 raise shields 
 mr chekov i have lost the bird of prey she must have cloaked 
 closing 
 position bird of prey 
 shuttle en route 
 do you realize what you have done it wasnt bloodshed i wanted 
 i instruct you to surrender you are under attack by federation forces 
 whats going on 
 we will be happy to beam down but first we must have certain assurances 
 then its fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me in the meantime captain chekov i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates 
 you are a master of understatement they are likely to destroy the planet 
 your threats amuse me captain chekov what consequences did you have in mind 
 this is captain pavel chekov speaking you are in violation of neutral zone treaty i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences 
 a federation starship 
 this is the starship enterprise 
 understood kirk out 
 no but you can bet they will 
 have the klingons responded 
 your orders are to proceed to nimbus iii assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible above all however get those hostages back safely 
 oh please 
 other ships yes but no experienced commanders captain i need jim kirk 
 with all due respect the enterprise is a disaster there must be other ships in the quadrant 
 the klingon the romulan the federation consuls now i know enterprise is not exactly up to specs 
 the same from what we can make out a terrorist force has captured the only settlement and they have taken hostages 
 on the planet of galactic peace 
 i apologize for canceling shore leave but look we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii 
 you caught me on my way to the shower 
 jim well we are dressing informally arent we 
 bob 
 enterprise this is starfleet operations come in 
 can we have it quiet 
 have faith my friend there are more of us than you know 
 but how 
 perhaps i have a way to bring one here 
 a starship there are no starships on nimbus iii 
 what you seek what all men have sought since time began ultimate knowledge but to find it we will need a starship 
 what is it you seek 
 join my quest 
 i feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart how can i repay you for this miracle 
 the power was within you 
 where did you get this power 
 let us explore it together 
 what do you know of my pain 
 your pain runs deep 
 its all i have 
 besides i cant believe youd kill me for a field of empty holes 
 beam up spock and dr mccoy now 
 shes got partial power sir i might be able to take two of you 
 mr scott you are amazing 
 head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right then left at the blowscreen you cant miss it 
 mr scott get the transporter working if we contact a rescue ship we will need it which way to the turbo shaft 
 if we could send a distress signal 
 captain we cant trust anyone now 
 then we will have to get them out the old fashioned way 
 scotty here captain transporter is still inoperative even if we could lock onto the hostages we couldnt beam them up 
 i hope it wont come to that mr scott 
 dont you worry captain we will beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push 
 aye captain how many times do i have to tell you the right tool for the right job 
 very well mr scott carry on 
 i think you gave me too much time captain 
 you told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks i gave you three what happened 
 go sulu 
 bird of prey bearing one zero five mark two 
 transporter room status 
 paradise city can you boost your power we are barely receiving transmission 
 respond with static let them think we are having difficulty which wouldnt be far from the truth 
 captain we are receiving transmission from paradise city they are demanding to know our intentions 
 standard orbit mr sulu 
 put it on the screen 
 captain we are receiving the hostage information you requested 
 put it on the veiwscreen would you please 
 captain starfleet transmission on line 
 er you forgot to take it with you 
 why didnt you beep my communicator 
 mr scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft the transporter beam is nonoperational captain we have received important orders from starlet command 
 yes i lost a brother once i was lucky i got him back 
 i was thinking of sybok i have lost a brother 
 maybe hes not out there bones maybe hes right here in the human heart spock 
 not possible you were never alone 
 spock i thought i was going to die 
 welcome aboard captain 
 spock 
 i believe we are witnessing my birth 
 what is this 
 its all right captain proceed 
 spock dont 
 mark two request emergency assistance acknowledge 
 mark two 
 to anyone within the sound of my voice this is captain james t kirk of the federation starship enterprise if you read me acknowledge acknowledge 
 the emergency channel open 
 spock 
 fire the rockets 
 if i activate them now captain we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate 
 spock the booster rockets 
 it must be all those marsh melons 
 it would appear we are too heavy 
 uhuh 
 hmmm 
 i believe i have found a faster way 
 the only problem is its up there we are down here 
 there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room 
 c k 
 new word b a um 
 a nuh d end of word 
 a t 
 you are right im a little out of practice uhthats an s 
 thats a little vague spock 
 i am here captain 
 spock my only concern is getting the ship back when thats done and sybok is in here then you can debate sha ka ree until you are green in the face until then you are either with me or you are not 
 sybok possessed the keenest intellect i have ever known 
 but the center of the galaxy cant be reached no ship has ever gone into the great barrier no probe has ever returned 
 there sha ka ree is fabled to exist 
 that hes found it sha ka ree the reason sybok left vulcan 
 is what possible 
 is it possible 
 he did have pointed ears 
 this er person didnt by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble did he 
 the designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find he failed to escape 
 how do you know 
 this is a new brig captain it is escapeproof 
 theres got to be a way out of this place 
 hes sorry see hes sorry everything that makes everything all right hes sorry everythings 
 i was not disposed to discuss matters of a personal nature for that im sorry 
 why didnt you tell me this before 
 exactly that is correct syboks mother was a vulcan princess upon her death sybok and i were raised as brothers 
 i gotta sit down 
 i have a half brother 
 there you see see 
 technically you are correct i do not have a brother 
 you did too sybok couldnt possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you dont have a brother 
 i did not 
 you mean hes your brother brother you made that up 
 no no no captain you do not understand sybok also in a son of sarek 
 look the man may be a fellow vulcan but that doesnt 
 you ordered me to kill my brother 
 i ordered you to defend this ship 
 if i had pulled the trigger sybok would be dead 
 you stay out of this why spock why i all you had to do was pull the trigger 
 if you think it would help 
 forgive you i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass 
 worse i have betrayed you i do not expect you to forgive me 
 what you have done is betray every man on this ship 
 captain what have i done 
 damnit spock god damnit 
 let me do something 
 you must allow us to act 
 an eternity during which we will be vulnerable to klingon attack korrdyou tell him 
 exactly N seconds 
 yes captain 
 be one with the horse 
 yes captain 
 spock 
 we dont have N hours 
 at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at N hours 
 mr sulu execute 
 to land any closer would risk detection 
 that puts us pretty far away from paradise city 
 their equipment is primitive but effective i recommend we land at coordinate N 
 damn lets go 
 klingon vessel now entering quadrant bird of prey estimating N hours until her weapons come to bear 
 fascinating 
 when he encouraged others to follow him he was banished from vulcan never to return 
 he believed the key to selfknowledge was emotion not logic 
 why 
 he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors 
 the knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by vulcan belief 
 what do you mean 
 there was a young student exceptionally gifted possessing of great intelligence it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan but he was a revolutionary 
 who is it he reminds you of 
 i do not often think of the past 
 he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth 
 but he does seem familiar 
 i cannot be certain 
 spock what is it do you know this vulcan 
 perhaps i have captain perhaps i have 
 what is it you look like you have seen a ghost 
 general korrds military strategies were required learning when i was a cadet at the academy when they put me out to pasture i hope i fare better than korrd 
 the same hes apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command 
 not general korrd 
 yes 
 i could use a shower 
 goodnight doctor 
 goodnight spock 
 goodnight bones 
 yes captain 
 go to sleep spock 
 life is not a dream 
 yes spock

 thats great i havent sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa what are we going to sing what bones what are we going to sing 
 oh i believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong 
 i am preparing to toast a marsh melon 
 what are you doing 
 i have always known i will die alone 
 i dont understand 
 oh no it isnt that i knew i wouldnt die because the two of you were with me 
 perhaps because it is there is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain 
 oh god 
 spock i appreciate your concern but if you dont stop distracting me im liable to be one 
 concentration is vital you must be one with the rock 
 i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods 
 on the contrary gravity is foremost on my mind look im trying to make an ascent here why dont you go pester dr mccoy for a while 
 i do not think you realize the gravity of your situation 
 mm 
 ah captain 
 because its there 
 and that is 
 im not trying to break any records im doing this because i enjoy it not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain 
 i regret to inform you that the record for freeclimbing el captain is in no danger of being broken 
 im flattered twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me 
 spock what are you doing in this neck of the woods 
 spock 
 kirk to enterprise listen carefully 
 what have i done 
 because you too must know 
 what makes you think i wont turn us around 
 no conditions 
 no special conditions 
 the ship needs its captain 
 about the ship 
 am i we will see 
 you are mad 
 given to me by god he waits for us on the other side 
 your vision 
 but if we do will that convince you that my vision was true 
 wait you know we will never make it through the great barrier 
 no i refuse 
 now learn something about yourself 
 no i didnt 
 i have done nothing this is who they are didnt you know that 
 spock what have you done to my friends 
 i dont control minds i free them 
 the only realty i see is that im a prisoner on my own ship what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew 
 sha ka ree the scource heaven eden call it quitu to the romulans its vorta vor the andorian word is unpronounceable still every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang for us that place will soon be a reality
