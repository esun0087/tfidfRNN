 why do we have to get into the question of what the school boards policy is and what things they can make its policy surely it can be the it must be the policy of any school to discourage breaking of the law i mean suppose this banner had said kill somebody and there was no explicit regulation of the school that said you should not you should not foster murder wouldnt that be suppressible 
 of course that is not 
 of course it would so 
 the answer is yes 
 why cant we decide this case on that narrow enough ground that any school whether it has expressed the policy or not can suppress speech that advocates violation of the law 
 i think it can but it raises some interesting potential hypothetical questions what about listening to the voice of martin luther king junior conscientious objection and so forth i dont think the court needs to stray into those areas because here we have a written policy which does in fact respond to concerns about the exercise of standardless discretion 
 does it have 
 let me just clear up one thing to be N percent sure i understand your position it does the message is the critical part of this case if it was a totally neutral message on a N foot sign that would be okay you are not saying N foot signs are disruptive 
 not inherently disruptive but in fact the answer is yes we are not saying that 
 and so we are focusing on the message and thats the whole crux of the case 
 thats why this case is here because of the message 
 well why is that why why i mean suppose you go on a school trip and the teacher says on the school trip i dont want people unfurling N foot banners i dont care what they are about 
 it may very well be 
 we are going to visit the state capital and we are not marching down the street with N foot banners i mean does the first amendment say the teacher cant say that 
 it does not but the juneau school board and N justice breyer allows in fact it has a tinker statement in the first paragraph of N which is also you will not be advocating drugs and so there is essentially a culture of liberty in juneau you dont have to 
 you just said suppose why should i not say that i mean im not going to do it necessarily but why could i not say would it be wrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a school trip tell the students they cant unfurl N foot banners is that a correct statement of the law or not in your opinion 
 in my opinion it is a correct statement of the law but in response to justice stevens question the message here is in fact critical because what we know about this case is that and you are here of course to respond to this case which has to do with a message that the message interpreter deborah morse who by the way 
 its also critical here to your case that it was a school event if it if this had have been two blocks down the street there would have been no objection 
 if mr frederick had seen fit to go down glacier avenue to j and js a popular hangout there would have been no high school jurisdiction there may have been elementary school but yes he could have gone justice stevens to the state capital or anywhere along the ten mile route 
 suppose it were saturday instead of a weekday 
 i beg your pardon 
 suppose it were saturday not a school day and the school children were not required to show up at the olympic event but were encouraged to and the same thing happened would it make a difference that it wasnt in the course of a regular school day 
 no i think it still under your hypothetical would be school sponsored but there might be a more difficult showing of disruption or inconsistency with the educational mission that is what this court articulated in frazier and again in kuhlmeier that the school is able under our policies of federalism and value of federalism and democratic theory to fashion its educational mission subject to constitutional safeguards and that mission of preventing the schools from being infected with prodrug messages continues wherever there is school jurisdiction and that would include on a saturday field trip or other kind of activity and i think that 
 mr starr you you responded to justice breyer that you think the school could just prohibit the unfurling of N foot banners on a trip could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands on a trip 
 i dont believe so 
 and if not if not whats the difference 
 because of the potential for disruption disorderliness in the event and the judgment that is entrusted to 
 but dont we have to be more specific about the context in determining whether theres disruption if its a school trip to an art museum unfurling a N foot banner in front of the pictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object of the trip unfurling a banner in a classroom is going to be disruptive to the teaching of shakespeare or whatever is supposed to be going on in there what we have here is the unfurling of a banner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing snowballs waiting for some somebody to run by with a tv camera nearby and there is a real question as to whether it seems to me as to whether it is in a kind of practical real world sense disruptive of anything and if there is such a question shouldnt the answer favor the right to to make the speech as opposed to favor the right to suppress it 
 your honor the answer is no we do think that if the test that this court has articulated which we embrace looks not simply to disruption but inconsistency with what this court has focused this courts language the basic educational mission then surely 
 all right let me let me follow actually ask you the same question on on that because in response to justice scalias question you said certainly that the school has got the right to have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling for violations of the law accepting that as a premise dont we need before the school may suppress the speech dont we need at least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with that policy and if that is so is bong hits N jesus inconsistent with it it sounds like just a kids provocative statement to me 
 your honor with all due respect the key is to allow the school official to interpret the message as long as that interpretation is reasonable you might disagree with that just as justice brennan disagreed with whether matt fraziers speech was all that terrible but he said even though it wasnt all that terrible i nonetheless defer to the interpretation of school officials thats what our educational system is about 
 but those were the words and characterizing them as offensive or but here one could look at these words and say its just nonsense or one could say its like mareseatoats it isnt clear that this is smoke pot 
 your honor again deborah morse a conscientious principal interpreted the message in light of the subculture of the school where drug use is a serious problem and it was on the spot judgment we believe that judgment was reasonable as opposed to a judgment reached in judicial chambers but we know that that was also the judgment of the superintendent and district judge 
 is that a judgment clear enough as a matter of law or is there possible debate as to whether thats a reasonable interpretation of the message lets assume it was an ambiguous message would we have to accept her interpretation on summary judgment 
 yes i believe you do and well thats of course a question for the district judge and here the judge analyzed the facts in terms of what the individual was trying to say and determined that that is a reasonable interpretation and that is all that is required under this courts law id like to reserve the remainder of my time thank you 
 thank you counsel mr kneedler 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the first amendment does not require public school officials to stand aside and permit students who are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote or encourage the use of illegal drugs as this court observed in earls the nationwide drug drug epidemic makes the war against drugs a pressing concern in every school 
 and is that the rationale on which you wish us to decide this case nothing more broad 
 the court need not decide anything more broadly than that 
 im asking what your recommendation is to what our rule should be this case 
 well i think this is a manifestation of the principle articulated in earls and repeated in hazelwood that a school does not have to tolerate a message that is inconsistent with its basic educational 
 well thats a very i find that a very a very disturbing argument because schools have and they can defined their educational mission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of political speech and speech expressing fundamental values of the students under the banner of of of getting rid of speech thats inconsistent with educational missions 
 thats why i think there would there would be it would make a lot of sense for the court to articulate a rule that had to do with encouraging illegal conduct and particularly 
 well why go into this i mean thats what i actually seriously dont understand suppose the rule has the following rule by the way on our field trips you can carry around N foot banners they can say anything except they cant talk about drugs and they cant talk about sex and they cant talk about i dont know or id say three things would that be constitutional 
 well i think i think a school could certainly prohibit the display of banners on a school trip or in a school assembly 
 suppose that this particular person had whispered to his next door neighbor bong hits N jesus heh heh heh you know supposed thats what had happened 
 and that may well that may well be different and thats why i 
 no what would be different thats what i what a principal that has to act quickly sees across the street at a school meeting a big banner go up making a joke out of drug use so the principal acts now are we supposed to divide that into little bitsy parts because as soon as we do we are going to get a rather interesting complicated and very difficult set of constitutional rules but you want us to do that 
 no i do not i think i think the point that you make that a principal sees the banner across the street and sees the word bong hits and and at the very moment when the olympic torch was about to arrive i think it was she made a quick judgment and an entirely reasonable one that the display of the slang words bong hits 
 well then you are not arguing for the broad educational mission which is what you said at the first 
 well there are several gradations that the court could take advocacy of illegal conduct generally more specifically advocacy of illegal drugs but i believe i think its important to recognize that this courts precedents recognize recognize several different justifications for restricting student speech in tinker itself which dealt with political speech the court was careful to point out that even then if the speech could be shown to present a threat of a material disruption to the class work and i think this would answer your question mr chief justice if the teacher wants to teach shakespeare the teacher doesnt have to turn over the class to political speech 
 but thats a viewpointneutral regulation this isnt the principal didnt say this was a viewpointneutral regulation did she 
 no no and and and just to finish in tinker even with a viewpoint concern the court said if you could show material disruption and and the court made that clear in tinker by by its comparison to several lower court decisions where wearing buttons had been prohibited because they had caused disruption and the third category in tinker itself was where there would be an intrusion upon the rights of other students to be secure and be let alone thats tinker dealing with political speech but in frazier and hazelwood the court identified additional categories of speech that could be governed by the school and this is in footnote N of hazelwood the court made clear that the ability to regulate those categories of speech goes beyond the question of whether there would be disruption or whether there would be 
 so so you think that the not a N foot banner but a very discrete button that says legalize marijuana although it might be covered as not being disruptive under tinker it could be inconsistent with the schools mission and prohibited on that basis 
 well i think i think if if the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum in the state then that that might be the category of political speech that could not be regulated 
 and at at this very rally i mean i thought your brief said that its okay to work for change in existing law which such a sign would be but it is not okay to violate the law and no one was smoking pot in that crowd 
 but but the what was happening was a sign that was reasonably construed to encourage the use of illegal drugs 
 all right given the fact that this is a first amendment case isnt a court forced into the position if its going to be consistent with what else we have said even at the final appellate level of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the statement itself in determining whether it may be suppressed or punished and if we do that is it such a reasonable construction that this is an an incitement to illegal drug use i mean its a statement which makes makes the drug law look a little ridiculous i think but im not sure that that is very distinguishable from a statement saying you ought to change the drug law 
 well i i i think in in this courts decisions dealing with public schools this court has has a consistent theme as to give deference to the judgments by the educators public schools 
 do we have to give let me ask you this and maybe this is the as far as we can go with it here is that the answer to the question here about what the statement means 
 yes 
 in other words if we give deference your argument wins but if we dont give deference then does anybody really know what the statement means 
 i dont think the question is what mr frederick intended the question is what a reasonable observer would think and the words bong hits are slang that would be particularly have a particular characteristic of getting across to other student and they suggest a casual tolerance and encouragement of 
 what if the sign said bong hits should be legal 
 i i think that would be a judgment call i think the i think the casual use 
 under your view wouldnt the principals judgment always prevail 
 well it has to be a reasonable judgment and this is this is reflected in frazier 
 is that a question of fact or a question of law 
 pardon me 
 is whether its a reasonable judgment 
 i think ultimately its a question of law whether its a reasonable judgment 
 this this this parade had a theme to celebrate the olympics with the high school kids are carrying the torch the band is in it and suppose the banner said vote for vote republican vote democrat and he wants to be on the tv with that could this the principal make him take that sign out of the ground in that its inconsistent with the whole theme of of of the parade something like our kurle case 
 yes i i mean i think for this reason this was essentially an outdoor assembly where the whether the students were assembled to watch a particular different just as in an indoor assembly 
 is that different from the rationale you have put 
 yes again thats why i dont think theres any one single rule that governs all cases this this i think falls under the frazier standard where the court said that that schools have a duty to inculcate matters of civility and to prepare students for citizenship and not violating the law is an important part of that and teachers act in loco parentis they act as guardians and they should be able to do as this court says in earls what a reasonable guardian would do that would mean dont allow people to encourage lawbreaking 
 but it wasnt it wasnt like an assembly was it as i understand it the children were released from school but they were not required to attend this event and they were not required to stand in front of the school on the opposite side they werent monitored by their teachers so they and there were nonstudents in the crowd so its not like a school assembly 
 the students present at the event presence as the event was like an assembly students may go into an assembly hall and not have to sit with their class they were released from class but they were not released from school or school supervision there were teachers around there and the school could define what is the nature of our assembly at this public event and just as in in the auditorium a school could say there will be no political banners or frankly no banners about anything other than what the event is 
 were they required to go to this event and could they have skipped off and gone home without violating 
 they were not allowed to go home they were required they were required 
 they were required to attend 
 they were required to be there if the classroom teacher decided to let them go out there but they were under school supervision at that time 
 were they ever told what they were supposed to do in the sense did the school ever say we are letting you out on the street to celebrate the olympics and to do only that was was there an object to this release from the school building that was ever conveyed 
 if i may i dont think theres any question that he knew in advance that this was about the olympics thats why he made the sign and they were released to go out and watch the torch go by he hasnt raised any question of notice or due process concerns 
 thank you mr kneedler 
 thank you 
 mr mertz 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this is a case about free speech it is not a case about drugs 
 its a case about money your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case 
 he does have a damages claim against the school district and the principal but thats by no means his chief object here the overwhelming object is to assert his free speech 
 well would you waive damages against this principal who has devoted her life to the school and you are seeking damages for her for this sophomoric sign that was held up 
 we are certainly willing to negotiate a minimum settlement of damages that is not the object here 
 but theres a broader issue of whether principals and teachers around the country have to fear that they are going to have to pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take actions pursuant to established board policies that they think are necessary to promote the schools educational mission 
 that is indeed a legitimate fear your honor and we believe the existing law takes care of it by requiring before qualified immunity can be breached that there be a demonstration that under the existing law at the time available to her 
 and you think it was clearly established that she had to allow a student at a school supervised function to hold a N foot banner saying bong hits N jesus 
 i think it was clearly established at the time your honor that a principal could not engage in viewpoint censorship of a nondisruptive expression under both ninth circuit law and this courts law the case had 
 does that does that general statement that you just made apply to all circumstances in which a studentteacher relationship might be involved for example in the course of teaching a class in shakespeare would your rule prevail 
 the rule on qualified immunity 
 yes the general rule which the teacher is supposed clearly to have known here for example in the shakespeare class kid doesnt doesnt say anything he doesnt yell or scream or even raise his hand he just holds a little sign in the shakespeare class that says bong hits N jesus as i understood the general rule that you said the teacher was bound to know here the teacher i suppose would be required or the school would be required to tolerate that sign in the shakespeare class is that correct 
 i believe the analysis would be the tinker analysis in terms of substantial disruption of the lesson 
 well would there be a substantial disruption 
 it would all depend on the circumstances my guess is that if it were simply passively 
 if the kids look around and they say well so and so has got his bong sign again 
 they then return they then return to macbeth does the does the does the teacher have to does the school have to tolerate that sign in the shakespeare class 
 i believe that in circumstances where it is a substantial distraction 
 cant it just say no signs when you are supposed to be learning 
 your honor i think the answer is yes if they had a contentneutral rule prohibiting signs in school i believe that would be 
 but cant the school decide that its part of its mission to try to prevent its student from engaging in drug use and so that its going to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint is going to be that its opposed to it and so that it takes a particular view with respect to signs that in their view seem to encourage drug use 
 certainly it is within the schools mission to discourage drug use certainly it has many tools to allow it to get its own viewpoint certainly it can it does not need to provide a forum in the school itself for students with a contrary viewpoint but when a student is basically on his own time whether its outside of school 
 so your position would be different if this were in the student gym and they were having a discussion there was a program to discourage drug use and he held up his sign you would say it would be all right to take down the sign inside the school gym 
 no im not so sure 
 so it doesnt matter that this is outside it matters on the content of the sign not the location 
 well what matters is whether there is a substantial disruption of what the school is trying to achieve legitimately whether its a classroom lesson or a lesson on drug use 
 well but the school has the school has a program an anti drug program that shows movies it brings in policemen and social workers to preach against drug use and you are saying that never mind unfurling a banner you are saying that it has to let students contradict this message its trying to teach to walk around you know with a button that says smoke pot its fun 
 i believe your honor 
 does the school have to do that 
 i believe your honor that a nondisruptive pin badge whatever you want to call it would have to be tolerated however they would not have to tolerate a student who interrupts a antidrug presentation 
 but the school even though it is trying to teach one point of view can allow students to come in and undermine that point of view assuming that its legitimate to teach that point of view it can allow students to come in and undermine what its trying to teach 
 i think that 
 and that is not disruption in your view 
 i think they cannot prevent presentation of a contrary viewpoint as long as it is done in such a way that it doesnt interfere with the schools own presentation of its viewpoint 
 can the student be allowed to wear a button that says rape is fun 
 no i dont think so 
 why 
 there is a distinction there 
 why 
 because when you are talking about hate speech speech that advocates violence then you are in another category of speech there has been general recognition 
 nonviolent crimes are okay its only violent crimes that you cant you can not promote right right 
 i think there is a 
 extortion is profitable thats okay 
 well 
 this is a very very with all respect ridiculous line i mean i can understand you are saying you cannot promote things that are unlawful but to say oh its only violent where do you get that line from only violent unlawful acts 
 no im not saying only violent unlawful acts but this is a case where if you look at it in the context of what was going on in the state at the time where there was an active public debate on marijuana policy on marijuana for medical use marijuana for personal use so its 
 so its a political even assuming its a political issue the question is whether the school has to say our classrooms our field trips our sponsored and supervised activities are a forum for that debate 
 i believe it does not have to if being a forum would disrupt the schools own educational program and 
 and disruption does not include undermining the message they want to send it has to be some type of physical disruption but undermining the message they want to send they cant make the judgment that thats not allowed 
 preventing a contrary viewpoint from being expressed that we 
 yes but you rephrased it that way but what actually happened is the principal looks across the street a N foot banner goes up at whats supposed to be a school event with everybody together in a single place and it says a joke it makes a joke out of drug use the principal thinks of course adolescents and postadolescents sometimes like to test limits and if the kids go around having N foot banners making a joke out of drug use that really does make it a little tougher for me to convince the students at this school not to use drugs and particularly putting up N foot banners i dont know why everybody wants to get away from that because i think you would have had a very different case if in fact it had been a whisper or if it had been a serious effort to contest the drug laws it wasnt either it was a joke it was a N foot banner we have the message plus the means plus the school event now whats your response 
 my response your honor is that first of all a N foot banner 
 thats an excellent response i think 
 that was just a preliminary in fact what it was was a person displaying this banner in a quiet passive manner that didnt interfere with anybodys observation 
 i conceive that interference consists of its pretty hard to run a school where kids go around at public events publicly making a joke out of drugs thats what his thought is now i dont think he has to be able to read content discrimination viewpoint discrimination timeplace he doesnt know the law the principal his job is to run the school and so i guess what im worried about is a rule that would is on your side a rule that takes your side we will suddenly see people testing limits all over the place in the high schools but a rule that against your side may really limit peoples rights on free speech thats what im struggling with now i want some help there and im worried about the principal 
 i believe the answer is that the tinker case as we understand it struck a very wise compromise between allowing school officials to have complete discretion to suppress student speech in order to maintain what they conceive of as their individual mission and the students right to speak in a nondisruptive manner the speaker the tinker case has stood the test of time for N almost N years and although 
 well you can say that but the subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on it i mean it stood the test of time in the sense that it hasnt been overruled but 
 there have been some narrow exceptions to it in subsequent cases of course the frazier and the kuhlmeier cases but the basic the heart of it the requirement that the school demonstrate that substantial disruption before it can engage in suppression of 
 i think we are using disruption in two different senses here and we should probably separate the two one sense is disrupting the class so that whatever is being taught cant be taught but you are also using it in the sense of undermining a general message that the school is trying to get across obey the law dont use drugs whatever maybe we should have a different word for the first is disruption disruption is a is a funny word for the second lets called it undermining instead now you think both of them however are bad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the speech 
 if i understand your question correctly the second of them might better be called allowing competing viewpoints 
 so you think undermining is perfectly okay you would never consider undermining to be disruption and therefore bad 
 i think undermining in the sense of preventing impeding the school from delivering its own message 
 okay but only that 
 would be substantial disruption 
 right after a class on drugs he can be standing there in the hall and say this class was ridiculous drugs are good for you i use them all the time i urge all of you thats perfectly okay thats not undermining 
 i believe that is the kind of speech 
 thats not disruption 
 that we must tolerate no matter how unwise it is 
 but couldnt the school couldnt the school board have a time place or manner regulation that says you are not going to use the halls to proselytizer for your cause whatever it may be 
 i believe thats correct 
 you could have reasonable rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school building 
 right 
 does the school have to be completely neutral in that respect does it have to punish who says that was a good program im not going to use drugs and you shouldnt either because hes taking position on a public issue 
 i think a content neutral content neutrality is critical here and if the school wants to allow antidrug comments messages then it has an outside of the official forum 
 where does that notion that our schools have to be content neutral i thought we wanted our schools to teach something including something besides just basic elements including the character formation and not to use drugs they have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs or not 
 content neutrality goes to what speech is suppressed or punished as far as the school delivering its own message there is no requirement of equal time or that it be neutral its got its own viewpoint in the case of drugs a viewpoint that almost all of us agree with and it should be able to espouse 
 a school isnt an open forum a school isnt there for everybody to teach the students whatever he wants its there for the teachers to instruct and you are turning it into an open forum if the school says addresses one issue everybody else has to be able to address that issue 
 i dont believe thats the case at all your honor 
 thats not my vision of what a school is 
 in the classroom delivering the prescribed messages in the school assemblies when the school wishes to present a particular message thats one case however in the lunchroom outside in recess across the street that is a quintessentially open forum where it would not be proper i think to tell students you may not mention this subject you may not take this position 
 but do you concede that there was some right of school control for what was going on across the street 
 no actually our primary position on that is that he was in a public place at a public event among public people 
 if kids were throwing bottles and injuring passers by the principal had no right or duty to go over there and stop it 
 oh i think if they were engaging in an act of hooliganism 
 well thats because the school has a right of control 
 there is a distinction here this young man had not been in school today had not been an campus was not in any class that was released to 
 why did he go where he went 
 pardon 
 why did he choose that location to unfurl his banner 
 he explained because it was the only place where he actually knew the route of the relay 
 but i mean thats i have i guess his note you accept this with what the teacher said the entire class went to view the relay individual students this is at N in the morning they were not given the option of remaining in class nor were they released to do as they pleased they were to watch the relay with the rest of the student body either just in front of the school or just across the street thats me not them and then return directly to their classrooms which i guess the school did so it sounds like you are going to one place stand together behave yourselves watch the relay and the teachers will be there and take you back to class now is there something else in the record that suggests something different 
 there is a major dispute on that point your honor we presented several affidavits that showed individual teachers 
 just tell me where to look where are the conflicting affidavits im just reading from page N of the joint appendix i didnt know there was a dispute 
 it would be on pages N N N 
 okay i will look at those another somewhat minor point can i ask you another point about the record i will read those 
 okay can i finish the description of what actually happened according to the students for those who were released from class there was no requirement for staying on campus and many of them did not stay on campus no requirement for 
 no they went across the street 
 some of them did some went down 
 was there any there was no requirement they didnt have to go across the street or stay on campus they could wander off distantly 
 they could and many of them did 
 okay 
 and there was no requirement that they stay together no requirement that they do anything in particular they 
 i had to watch not even watch the parade no requirement they watch the parade they were released in order to watch the parade 
 that was the intent obviously for those released 
 the intent it was the direction 
 but 
 it was not only the intent it was the direction 
 actually it was not according to these student affidavits they were simply released and said you can go watch 
 was there any fact finding on that you referred to affidavits 
 no it was decided on cross motions for summary judgment in the district court and there were no findings actually no factual findings at all and certainly nothing on that particular point 
 can i ask you another record point just so i know where to look 
 yes 
 you have also asked for an injunction that would require expunging his N day suspension from his record 
 correct 
 N days well N or N unclear i noticed the superintendent of schools on page N a when hes reviewing this what he says is joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable because he was exercising his free of speech right even if i were to concede his speech across from the high school is protected which i do not the rest of his behavior warranted the suspension and then he says and im cutting it from N days to N so given that if you win suppose you were to win and you that it is protected and so forth then would you concede or not concede the suspension the N days its over it still stands i dont care about the expungement or not 
 the whether it remains on the record anything that remains on his record is obviously much more 
 no but im asking that you think about it im putting you on the spot 
 in that case i missed the point of your 
 i want to know what the superintendent said as i read it is he says look i dont care if this was protected or not i will give you that its protected but the rest of his behavior the way he treated the principal what he did the reluctance et cetera et cetera that warrants a suspension too and im cutting it from N days to N so it sounds to me as i read it that the teacher is saying even if you are right hes still suspended for N days thats what the superintendent says now suppose you win your point that you are interested in winning which you may not or you may are you still then going to pursue this case on the N days that that should be erased 
 if the only thing left were discipline because he was tardy that day was didnt divulge the names of the other people holding the banner that sort of thing we couldnt 
 i think its 
 you couldnt what i didnt hear the last part of what you said you just got to the point of 
 of answering the question 
 yes whats the answer 
 those things wouldnt manner anymore 
 so you would not pursue it 
 correct 
 can we get back im sorry 
 go ahead 
 can we get back to what the case is about you think the law was so clearly established when this happened that the principal that the instant that the banner was unfurled snowballs are flying around the torch is coming should have said oh i remember under tinker i can only take the sign down if its disruptive but then under frazier i can do something if it interferes with the basic mission and under kuhlmeier i have got this other thing so she should have known at that point that she could not take the banner down and it was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own pocket because of it 
 mr chief justice there are two different time points we have to talk about theres the heat of the moment out there on the street but then later back in the office when she actually decided to levy the punishment after she had talked to him after she heard why he did it and why he didnt do it after she had had a chance to consult with the school districts counsel at that point in the calmness of her office then she should indeed have known it and she did testify that she had taken a masters degree course in school law in which she studied kuhlmeier and frazier and tinker so 
 and so it should be perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and couldnt do 
 yes 
 as it is to us right 
 i mean we have had a debate here for going on N minutes about what tinker means about the proper characterization of the behavior the nonspeech behavior the schools terms in dealing with the kids that morning the meaning of the of the statement we have been debating this in this courtroom for going on an hour and it seems to me however you come out there is reasonable debate should the teacher have known even in the in the calm deliberative atmosphere of the school later what the correct answer is 
 we believe at the very least she should have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive holding of a sign because it said something you disagreed with 
 of course i disagree with the characterization on disruptive it was completely disruptive of the message of the theme that the school wanted to promote completely disruptive of the reason for letting the students out to begin with completely disruptive of the schools image that they wanted to portray in sponsoring the olympics 
 well they werent sponsoring the olympics they werent even sponsoring this event actually they simply let the students out to watch it that was 
 some of the students were carrying the torch and the band was playing in the parade 
 a few of the student a few of the relay runners were from the school and had been allowed to skip school because of that and the pep band played as it went by i do not believe that made the torch relay a school event the best that can be said for them is that they let the students watch it with the concurrence of individual teachers and that that attendance was a school sanctioned attendance now whether that allows them to then engage in this kind of punishment for speech by a student who was not even among those released who is standing 
 now you said that in your brief and i couldnt understand that somehow you got mileage out of his being truant that morning would the case have come out differently would you be making any different argument if he got to school on time and was released with the rest of them does the case turn on the fact that he was late to school that day 
 we believe it would be a closer question but the fact that he was not there in school today and intentionally was not there today turns this into a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in a public place in a public event who was not acting as a student 
 so hes not a school child he would be playing hooky 
 because he was playing hooky because he chose not to be there because he was not part of the class 
 even though the law required him to be there 
 thats right 
 he wasnt playing hooky he showed up late thats all right i mean he actually came and joined his classmates at an event that he knew was an event that the school told the classes to go to 
 he joined 
 as far as im concerned he just showed up late 
 he joined a public crowd on a private side public sidewalk in front of private homes the crowd happened to have some other students in that school there 
 where did he go immediately after he went to the school building for whatever it was the third period of the day 
 yes the principal instructed him to do so and he did 
 so under your view if the principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the street had to come up and say now how many here are truants and how many here are i cant discipline you because you are a truant you can go ahead and throw the bottle 
 no i dont think she needs to do that in the heat of the moment but later on once shes discovered the true facts then at that point i think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student if he was not there as a student 
 because you are both a truant and disrupter you get off 
 had you been just a disrupter tough luck 
 well it may well be that he could have been punished for being truant but of course thats not why we are here he was punished for displaying for the content of the sign he was displaying in a public place as a private citizen 
 who were the people that helped him hold up his flag were they not classmates of his 
 most of them were classmates at least one was not a student 
 did he not know that these classmates were there at a public event that was sponsored not sponsored but to which the school had directed the students to go 
 im sure he did know 
 so it seems to me its like joining a school trip at the zoo you know you you dont make it to the to the school but you drive there yourself and then join the class as its going through the zoo it seems to me hes in school 
 a better analogy might be if he had gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in some expressive act and there happened to be a school group there at the same time could the teacher with that group then have disciplined him for what he was doing 
 that gets back to the point i was trying to make earlier he came here because it was the school event the school sponsored activity he could have gone anywhere along the route he knew that it was coming by the school he knew that they were going to be the students were going to be released to see it he went to join up with the school even if he were truant that day 
 no your honor i believe thats incorrect there is nothing in the record that even suggests that he went there in order to join up with schoolmates or in order to be near the school he says in fact he intentionally tried to avoid the school because he thought that that way he could avoid the school jurisdiction for his 
 you think he could have been marked absent for the whole day because he didnt intend to be part of the school group afterwards i mean suppose theres a suspension of so much for half a day truancy and so much more for a whole days truancy and he shows up and he says oh you cant you have to hold me for a whole days truancy because i didnt intend to be in school i was in school but i didnt intend to be there 
 i think it would all depend on whether he 
 that doesnt make any sense to me does it depend on his intent whether or not he intended to be a truant that afternoon 
 i think that would depend on the fact of whether he was a truant that afternoon 
 he was either in school or he wasnt in school 
 in the morning he wasnt in school 
 in the afternoon he either was or he wasnt 
 in the afternoon he was 
 and the question is whether joining the school group intentionally joining the school group going there because the school group was there whether that places him in school 
 as a hypothetical if he were intentionally joining a school group i would have to say that puts him within whatever jurisdiction the school has 
 why does it matter that is why doesnt the you are suing the teacher or the principal and why wouldnt the issue be what that principal really reasonably thought the situation was i mean if a principal reasonably thought he was part of the school group if the principal reasonably thought that this was a school outing if the principal reasonably thought that students are staying together why wouldnt that just be the ground on which youd take the case we should take it that way because the principal reasonably thinks 
 as far as qualified immunity i think thats correct if she had a reasonable belief 
 but even on the merits 
 on the merits i dont think so because if he was not in fact there as part of a school group 
 even if the principal couldnt tell him to take down the manner even if she thought he was part of the school group reasonably if he really wasnt 
 i do not believe theres anything in the law that allows a principal to convert a pure free speech exercise into a school exercise because its 
 i thought you were going to appeal to the calm of her office the next day i thought that was going to be your answer to my question whatever she thought at the time she didnt think it later 
 may i ask to you clarify one thing i initiated this line of questioning when i said i was surprised that your brief made such a big deal that he was late to school you would still be making the argument about the free speech right if he had diligently showed up for his math class first period in the morning gone out with the others and had his banner to unfurl when the torch came by 
 that is correct we have two independent bases for defending him here one is the pure free speech in a public place argument thats the one that hinges on the fact that he was not among the released students the other argument which we believe in equally is that even if it were a oncampus or on an extension of campus like a field trip then under tinker because it was not disruptive they cannot punish it my time is up i thank the court 
 thank you mr mertz mr starr you have a minute remaining 
 for the reasons that have been discussed under no circumstances should deborah morse a conscientious principal be subjected to the possibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages a very brief factual point in light of the richness of the discussion with respect to the facts i would guide the court to page N of the joint appendix this is deborah morses interrogatory answer and there she sets forth the facts and that bleeds into the law to promote drugs and this is our fundamental suggestion and submission to promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the basic educational mission of the school and for this court to suggest to the contrary would really be quite inconsistent with much of its drug jurisprudence bernonia and earls the opinion of the court in earls N is especially powerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their dangers more broadly the court does not need to go more broadly but the court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission but we know that there are in fact constitutional limits those limits are captured in tinker a passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom we are light years away from that i thank the court 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument today in case N roper versus weaver ms spillars 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court while this court has laid out a framework for reviewing prosecutors closing arguments the fairness standard established in donnelly and darden is by its nature a very general standard under this courts interpretation of aedpa the state court should therefore be provided more leeway in reaching outcomes nevertheless the eighth circuit afforded no deference to the missouri supreme courts decision instead its improperly substituted its own evaluation for the comments looking at each of them in isolation and without considering the totality of the proceedings that decision was wrong not only because the court of appeals failed to properly afford deference to the state court but because when viewed within the entire proceedings the prosecutors closing arguments did not deprive the respondent of a fair trial applying aedpa correctly the missouri supreme court decision was well within reason given one the nonspecific standard of fundamental fairness and the fact that this court has never applied that standard to a penalty phase closing argument and two because considering the record in the entire proceedings of this case the respondent was not deprived of fundamental fairness 
 well we didnt havent applied it to a penalty phase closing argument but we have certainly applied the general standard to the penalty phase 
 thats correct your honor and its certainly is not our argument that it would not apply to the penalty phase however there simply may be other considerations because the fundamental fairness standard essentially answers the question did the jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they base it improperly on the prosecutors comments 
 may i ask one sort of preliminary question supposing the prosecutor misstated the law in his closing argument would that be reviewable in this court under aedpa 
 i think it certainly could be in brown versus payton there was certainly a concern about the 
 do you think his argument here contained any misstatements of the law 
 no your honor 
 you dont 
 to help answer the question though in that context donnelly and darden set down some general considerations that while not exclusive help provide the post and beams of the fundamental fairness standard so even assuming that all of the statements were improper those considerations when applied to this case show that the trial was not rendered unfair because of the prosecutors argument first none of the comments misstated the evidence nor did they misstate the law 
 well just on your assumption to make your hypothetical clear you you want us to assume that three or four times at least he violated a constitutional standard 
 no your honor 
 i just want to know what arguendo assumption you are making 
 the assumption is that under the first tier in donnelly and darden that the statements were improper in the sense that within the context of the multifactor kind of considerations whether or not they were improper because obviously 
 i mean theyd be improper because they they were based on an emotional appeal thats improper 
 it could be improper in the sense that it was a misstatement of evidence i dont know that impropriety would include necessarily emotional appeal i mean the constitution does not require a trial devoid of emotion however impropriety under donnelly and darden was the first tier of the multitier kind of fundamental fairness test so even assuming that that first tier that the statements were improper they still did not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness secondly none of the individual comments implicated the defendants rights under the fifth or sixth amendment nor were they of the very specific kind of comments that this court has found to violate the eighth amendment under caldwell 
 dont you think the argument based on the general patton analogy told the jurors they had a duty to do what he suggested 
 no your honor i would disagree 
 what is the relevance of that argument otherwise 
 i would not it was not particularly relevant it was probably an inartful attempt to imply or tell the jury that it was a difficult decision that they had ahead of them one that they might 
 do you think if he said in so many words you have a duty to return the death penalty that would have been a misstatement of the law 
 yes a duty to return the death penalty which certainly is a misstatement of the law 
 and you dont think this could be so interpreted you dont think you could interpret that that passage that way 
 no your honor 
 that passage was in the context of other statements in which i think its fair to say that he analogized the role of the juror to the role of a soldier who has to have the courage and the duty to kill 
 i think a reasonable interpretation of those statements could be that the duty was to make the decision whether or not to impose the death penalty 
 wait why is it improper for for the prosecution to argue that given the facts of this case given the aggravating factors and the lack of mitigating factors the brutality of the crime the only sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of the jury is the death penalty thats an improper argument doesnt that amount to saying you have a duty to come back with the death penalty why cant the prosecution argue that 
 its certainly not improper to make statements based on inferences from the evidence 
 well do you think the patton argument has anything to do with the evidence i mean the patton argument correct me if im wrong but i thought the argument that referred to general patton was an argument that number one talked about his addressing the troops before battle and he was telling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes their duty to kill and he said go out there and do your duty which i assume any reasonable listener would say go out there and kill if a prosecutor as in this case tells that story and uses that analogy it seems to me that the argument is not an argument based on evidence but an argument based upon the situation the situation of the jurors vis a vis a capital defendant and i would suppose that the reasonable inference from the argument is that they have a duty to go out there to kill to impose the death penalty that does not sound to me like an argument based upon the evidence specific to this defendant and specific to this case now am i wrong 
 no your honor it certainly was not a statement on the evidence in sense of was it a discussion of the facts in the case however based on the totality of the entire proceedings its clear that that statement did not render the entire trial unfair because 
 i dont understand your concession surely the prosecutor was not telling this jury that in all capital cases you have to come in with a death verdict surely although he didnt explicitly mention the evidence the underlying premise of his argument was sometimes when you have a case this bad you have to do your duty nobody likes to kill but just as soldiers sometimes have to do that if thats their duty so also jurors if you really believe that the evidence is so onesided in favor of the penalty that the state is asking for its your duty to bring the death verdict i dont see anything wrong with that 
 and your honor to the extent that i would certainly agree that those arguments based on the strength of the case were not necessarily 
 i suppose your concession about the duty is based on chief justice stones opinion in viereck isnt it 
 well in the sense that viereck was not directly 
 which did involve the very word duty 
 im sorry 
 chief justice stones opinion in viereck talked about telling the jury that they have a duty and condemned that thats probably why you made the concession i think 
 i think the concession is important to get beyond the statements in isolation because 
 its not just in isolation didnt this prosecutor constantly say this case is not about weaver this case is larger than weaver i think several times in the closing the jurors were told think big think the large picture dont think about this individual 
 yes however the jury was also told that it was their discretion to spare his life at appendix N 
 it is i agree with you i agree with you that we should look at the whole picture when i look at the whole picture i have actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared and what he did he went through this and looked at a case called newlon and it was the same prosecutor and the prosecutor was told in that case just what he shouldnt do and now if we look what he did in this case and look what he did in that case and look at the law the whole thing not just little bits it looks like he did an awful lot of what he wasnt supposed to do you are not supposed to give an argument that vouches as the us attorney that i think that this is what you should do so in newlon he says im talking to you as prosecuting attorney of the county the top law enforcement officer and here he says im the top law enforcement officer and i decide in which cases we have the death penalty and not worse than newlon i would say then what you are not supposed to do is you are not supposed to tell them they are like soldiers i mean theres supreme court cases that say dont tell them you are like a soldier doing duty at least thats what all these prosecutors a case called byron versus the united states so in newlon what he says is i want to impress on you this is a war and its justifiable to kill in war here he says as in the movie patton and in the movie george patton is talking to his troops because they are going out in battle like the soldiers and then he says and when you are a soldier you know what to do when you put your hand in a pile of goo that a moment before was your best friends face you will know what to do and last july this defendants face was a pile of goo okay there we are i mean that sounds pretty emotional it sounds like a soldier does his duty and you are doing it and then another thing you are not supposed to do is you are not supposed to tell them its their duty to the community and this is just filled with instances where you hardly even know that theres a person called weaver because he says what you have to do here is send a message to the drug lords send a message 
 who said he was not supposed to do these things 
 well theres a brief 
 im sorry counsel maybe counsel if you could answer that question 
 in newlon your honor it was a due process case which the same prosecutor tried and it was an eighth circuit case and in that 
 and is that the law here 
 no your honor 
 its not why did they file is this brief wrong then the brief of the former prosecutors giving the propositions that i just stated and have the supreme court case next to each one are they wrong those prosecutors 
 to the extent that newlon sets out those arguments no thats not incorrect those arguments were made in newlon however for two reasons newlon is distinguishable in this case there were curative instructions given to the jury in newlon there were no objections made so in this case when the prosecutor made the statement for example that im the top law enforcement officer there was an objection and there was a curative instruction so it was not 
 was there with the patton and the goo 
 there was not an objection there was an objection to the patton but it was overruled 
 was there a curative instruction 
 no there was not 
 counsel im looking at the quote the statement the reference to patton and i have to say i dont read it as imposing a duty it says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes you have got to kill and sometimes you have got to risk death because its right his point is that at some point at some times you have to impose death because its right not because its your duty as a soldier now where is the reference to you have this duty as a soldier in the prosecutors statements 
 there is none your honor and a reasonable interpretation of that comment is that he was imparting to the jury the duty to make the decision not necessarily to impose the death penalty 
 in viereck the words were this is war harsh cruel murderous war and the prosecutor went on to analogize the jurys duties to the duties of soldiers and he said do your duty do you think thats a lot different than this case 
 well i would distinguish viereck on two grounds one it was not directly a due process case as this case is raised because it was raised under this courts supervisory powers secondly in this case there was out of the eight separate comments that the eighth circuit found improper only three of them were actually objected to two of which were sustained and curative instructions were given 
 but you just thats a bit inconsistent with your point that newlon is distinguishable because there were no objections at all and that was the reason for the court saying this goes too far to the prosecutor but now you say when there are objections 
 in newlon the jury was never told to disregard the statements in our case the jury was told to disregard the statements 
 certain statements there are were many objections made here that were overruled 
 correct there were N objections made total interestingly though the defense attorney did not raise objections to the majority of the comments that the eighth circuit found improper now while thats not dispositive i think that the defense attorney is certainly in the best position to judge whether or not a comment prejudices his client 
 to that extent the two cases were the same because in newlon there were no objections either 
 no objections at all there were no objections at all in our case there were N objections so clearly the defense attorney was on the mark and was listening for prejudicial comments from the prosecutor of the eight comments that the eighth circuit found objectionable in this case only three of them were objected to 
 do you think 
 so assuming that the defense attorney was im sorry 
 there were two cases cited as involving the same prosecutor was it shurn also 
 correct 
 and that there was a significant overlap in the three charges in the three cases the prosecutor had been told in two of them you went too far in this one just in terms of what the prosecutor said in the closing argument is this less offensive or would you say they are all on a par 
 i would actually if you compare the three arguments side by side the prosecutors statements were tempered in this case the decision when he tried this case it was approximately five weeks after the district court in newlon had come down with the decision and there are statements that he made in newlon and shurn that were not in this case for example in newlon he said this is the worst case ever and in shurn he said the same thing he did he not say that in this case so i think from if you do a side by side comparison his statements were actually tempered 
 could you tell us as you know aedpa has the decisions of settled precedents of the supreme court and theres the supreme court standard a very general standard that we can get from darden and donnelly although we didnt reverse there i take it that the counsel for the respondent is going to say well this is a federal standard but the eighth circuit is entitled to apply the specificity and the application that its given to this so the eighth circuits entitled to rely on its cases in reversing do you agree with that 
 no your honor 
 i assume thats what they are going to tell us 
 no your honor i would not agree 
 why 
 clearly its not established law by this court and this court has not specifically outlined the kind of post and beam that would result in a reversal in a penalty phase closing argument 
 it says that in the text doesnt it clearly established by the supreme court is that not in the text of the statute 
 correct yes 
 so those things that are improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the guilt phase are they then proper to say exactly those things in a sentencing phase with capital with you know capital sentencing 
 is it the same the same arguments in the 
 there are a number of cases in this court that say what a prosecutor cant say guilt phase all of them happen to be guilt phase i guess you cant you know vouch you cant use too much emotion you have to focus on what the defendant did not on what somebody else did i mean there are a number of things now do those is it fair or not fair to say that those precedents apply in the capital sentencing phase too 
 i think it is fair to say that but it is also fair to say that there may be other considerations that apply in the penalty phase that dont necessarily apply in the guilt phase 
 may i ask you this question about your position we are trying to find cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this court do you include in that group of cases cases such as berger against the united states and viereck against the united states which were direct review of federal cases in which they say there was a denial of the fair trial but they are not setting aside state cases would it be proper for the court of appeals to rely on those cases 
 no and this is why 
 even though those cases say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial 
 no because of the very specific nature of the supervisory powers in those cases i dont believe that in the larger context the final standards that we can say that those directly apply 
 if those direct federal cases were interpreting the constitutional provisions directly they would count as established law 
 certainly yes your honor there was also no mechanism in this case for the jury to apply any of the improper remarks to their deliberations because they were properly instructed instructions which we presume that they followed in this case the court read the instructions to the jury before closing arguments and a copy was also given to the jury to deliberate with four of those instructions numbers N N N and N told the jury in various forms that it was their duty and theirs alone to render a verdict the jury was also told in instructions N N and N that it was that their decision must be within the confines of the evidence and thirdly within the specific process laid out for finding ways mitigating and aggravating circumstances and finally the last instruction that the jury heard before closing arguments was that closing arguments were not evidence it is counterintuitive to assume that the jury disregarded those instructions as a whole and instead improperly relied on the prosecutors closing argument when they declined to find the one aggravating circumstance that the prosecutor spoke most about at appendix N is the part of the closing argument where the prosecutor discussed the aggravating circumstances he argued to the jury that all four applied but spent most time speaking about number one which was that he had killed for money however the jury did not find aggravator number N so the very aggravator that the prosecutor argued most about to the jury they did not find its more reasonable to conclude that the jury made its decision based on the strength of the evidence and the strong evidence in support of the death penalty having rejected the misidentification defense the jury necessarily found that the respondent was the passenger who had returned to the woods to shoot the victim several more times 
 may i go back to my question because theres a legal question here about what law we can look to under aedpa and actually of course it is a question of whether aedpa applies i suppose because actually wasnt this habeas petition filed two days before aedpa was theres a footnote in the red brief that says raises that question 
 there was a habeas petition filed prior to aedpa but it was dismissed and he did not appeal from that this was filed after aedpa 
 that was a slip on the district courts part wasnt it i mean that original petition that was dismissed because he had filed a cert petition to this court should not have been dismissed it should have been held in which case the petition would have been timely and would not have been trumped by an aedpa variant 
 however your honor he did not appeal from that 
 well didnt he seek a coa 
 yes he did however he did not appeal 
 this is a pro se prisoner he gets his all the claims are exhausted its dismissed and he seeks a coa on that point 
 however the parties have the respondent has not asserted that argument that aedpa does not apply in this case and for good reason because 
 certainly didnt say it in the brief in opposition and we might not well have taken the case had that point been raised in the bil 
 thats correct your honor finally given the overwhelming evidence it supported a finding that the respondent had carried out an execution style murder for the purpose of silencing a witness i will preserve 
 may i ask this question before you sit down in the viereck opinion chief justice stone reversed in that case and one of the reasons was the prosecutor indulged in an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case the purpose and effect of which could only have been to arouse passion and prejudice thats part of our federal law is that law applicable in this case do you think 
 not directly your honor 
 well it is either directly its either yes or no 
 i think certainly this court can use 
 that rule can be ignored by state prosecutors 
 certainly not ignored your honor but in the context of fundamental fairness as to whether or not that case applies i would argue that it does not directly apply 
 you have a much more limited point as i understand it your more limited point is simply that this is not clearly established law pronounced by the supreme court 
 well it is 
 in this area of constitutional violation 
 well the question i suppose is whether that is a constitutional rule it is established by the supreme court of the united states an opinion written by chief justice stone a good many years ago but you are argument is it is not applicable to state prosecutors as i understand it 
 not necessarily not applicable to state prosecutors however in the context of fundamental fairness does it establish a clear a rule in the sense of those kinds of statements will render a trial fundamentally 
 why would it be applicable to state prosecutors if it is not a rule i dont understand that is it applicable to a state prosecutor or not if a state prosecutor asked you for your advice is this opinion applicable and you tell him yes or no 
 certainly it is something that state prosecutors should follow in the sense of what they should say and what they should not say 
 but they must follow because its the law right 
 under the it is not the law in the sense of fundamental fairness it is certainly an indication of what 
 well where did chief justice stone get it from 
 im sorry 
 where did chief justice stone get it from just because of our supervisory power i mean if its just federal supervisory power then i think you could tell the counsel he doesnt have to follow it its due process 
 you cant have it both ways counsel i mean you are really losing me here either it is our supervisory power and therefore the states dont have to follow it or it is more than our supervisory power and the states do have to follow it i dont know that theres any way to straddle that 
 well i would argue that in those cases it is a supervisory power case and so to that extent its not applicable to this particular case i will reserve 
 thank you counsel mr blume 
 mr chief justice may it please the court as the former prosecutors brief makes clear george buzz westfalls penalty phase closing argument in mr weavers case contained a number of improper and mutually reinforcing statements which exploited the authority of his office analogized the jurys duties to that of soldiers in war time injected extraneous matters into the proceedings and appealed to the jurors passions and prejudice 
 well i think they overstated the significance of viereck isnt viereck does viereck stand do you think for a per se rule that a prosecutor in a closing argument may never mention the word soldier isnt that a much more limited much more limited holding this was a prosecution during world war ii of individuals for failing to register as agents of nazi germany and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase and it wasnt a capital case obviously in the guilt phase of closing argument that just as our soldiers who are fighting the japanese on the bataan peninsula are doing their duty for the country you have a duty to return a guilty verdict against these individuals now isnt that very different from saying that in a capital at the capital phase of the trial you have a duty to consider something thats very unpleasant and its unpleasant in the same way that what soldiers have to do in war time is different isnt that very different 
 i think the historical context is different but this was set up in this case by informing the jurors that we were involved in a war in a war on drugs in society and then he uses the same story analogizing jurors responsibilities to that of soldiers in a war i think it is also important to put that comment in the context in which it occurred not only in the broader context and the repeated the prosecutor repeatedly leveraging the power of his office behind this but this came right on the heels of him saying im the top law enforcement officer in this county i decide in which cases we seek the death penalty 
 that was objected to and the objection was sustained correct 
 it was objected to and the objection was sustained that doesnt mean that comment 
 and a curative instruction given 
 i agree with that but that doesnt mean its irrelevant for the due process totality of circumstances analysis and then he proceeds from there directly in to the patton analogy and i think if you read that analogy in context he is telling them you are soldiers in a war you have a duty to kill im like patton im telling you its your duty to kill go kill if you read that logically 
 which in that case aedpa says we look to clearly established law by our us supreme court decisions which is the clearest us supreme court decision that was violated here 
 the decision that was violated was the rule of darden donnelly and romano which is that 
 well pick which one do you think is the most directly applicable 
 well i think darden established the rule this court applied it to the penalty phase in romano and thus the darden rule that if a prosecutors comments the totality 
 its not romano romano was an introduction of evidence case right 
 yes but logically if you have established a rule for closing arguments you established it you then say it is applicable to the penalty phase for the admission of evidence it would be completely illogical to say it didnt govern penalty phase closing arguments 
 my point is simply the level of generality at which the guiding principles were articulated which helps when you are applying it but in determining it is the point judge bowman in dissent that when you dont have a case thats close that you have more leeway in terms of the deference to the court because its not a clearly established precedent of the supreme court yes there are the jenner cases that establish the general principles but the question is how clearly those were contravened before you can say it violated clearly established law 
 that is what this courts decisions say chief justice roberts i think i want to make clear that we have two different positions on that the first is that any state court decision finding this argument in its totality based on what happened and based on the weight of the evidence in this case that said that didnt render the proceedings fundamentally unfair would be an unreasonable application of darden and donnelly but in addition to that the missouri supreme court in this case said the decision was unreasonable because it failed to consider significant portions of mr weavers challenge to this argument it did the analysis under a state law abuse of discretion standard and it refused to consider or failed to consider several components of his claim 
 what do you mean how do you it failed to consider i mean is there an obligation to respond to every single point thats made 
 well 
 did they refuse to accept argument on those points 
 no but they on the first point did they refuse to did they fail to consider a number of the challenges like the patton analogy thats clear he raised that in his brief he said this was something im complaining about they did not consider it he raised the point about 
 if they did consider it you mean they did not respond to that argument in their opinion 
 they did not refer to it in their opinion 
 you dont know for sure that they didnt consider it i mean it may be argument to them how could they not have considered it they must have not considered it important but thats a different 
 he also raised the point about this is bigger than william weaver and that was improper and when the state court cited what he said they chose to ellipses that out and didnt even put in 
 well why is that improper is it improper at the penalty phase for a prosecutor to refer to the concept of deterrence which by definition is bigger than the individual whose sentence is being considered 
 i dont think this can properly be considered a deterrence argument when you say over and over this is far more important than william weaver this goes way beyond william weaver this is bigger than william weaver this doesnt just pertain to william weaver then you add that in with the number of comments about you need to give this person the death penalty 
 well could a prosecutor say one of the factors you must take into account when you begin to deliberate is the deterrent purpose of the death penalty deterrence is one of the reasons we have the death penalty 
 uhhuh 
 to teach us can he say that 
 i think he could say that 
 so then now we have the principle that you can talk about deterrence now it is just the way in which he talked about deterrence 
 no my point is i dont believe this is really a deterrence argument deterrence is not a substitute for moral culpability we allow the deterrent function of the death penalty as a justification for it but you couldnt give the death penalty to somebody who didnt deserve it under the states scheme in order to further deterrence 
 as i recall he didnt just say it is bigger than weaver he went on to discuss you know the drug gangs and he says they are not going to be affected by the threat of going to prison they will be affected by the threat of dying it seemed to me he tied it very very closely into deterrence and if you say that deterrence is okay for him to refer to i dont know how theres anything left to your argument about his saying its bigger than weaver 
 i think the import of this argument is you should give the person the death penalty even if you are not sure he deserves it in order to further the deterrent function of the death penalty 
 no but you are you are saying look he can make a general statement that we have a death penalty in part for its deterrent function but he cannot make the argument that you ought to apply the death penalty in this case solely for deterrent reasons ie reasons unanchored in the culpability of this particular defendant 
 thats correct not because what this statement did especially 
 where where where where where does it say that where does it say never mind the facts lets lets give this guy the death penalty as a napoleon said por encourage les autres you know he said it didnt matter which whether the general was guilty of of cowardice or not it would help to encourage the others to execute him where is there anything like that argument here i dont see it 
 i think that us the logical inference from the six or seven times he says in variety of he says this is bigger than william weaver the one thing you have got to understand is this is far more important than william weaver this is goes way beyond william weaver this does not pertain just to william weaver he says that on six or eight occasions and i think you could interpret that the logical interpretation 
 if you let a person who is as guilty as william weaver go you are affecting not just william weaver you are affecting the whole war on drugs you are affecting the whats wrong with that i i fail to see any indication here that hes telling the jury never mind the facts never mind how you know how horrible you think the crime was never mind all of the instructions that the judge gives you about aggravating factors and mitigating factors forget all of that kill william weaver because its bigger than him i i just dont i just dont see the argument 
 of course he does actually say kill him now at another point in there but i think if you take those comments you also look at those in the context of where he goes on and on about the consequences you need to send a message to the drug dealers thats a huge theme 
 what do you think go on and on suppose hed mentioned deterrence six times 
 i think as long as it is a blanket sort of statement that one purpose of the death penalty is deterrence that would probably be consistent with this courts decisions 
 right 
 thats not what is happening here justice kennedy especially when it is tied in to that to send a message and then he also goes on to talk about the consequences if you dont sentence this person to death then the animals will reign in the jungle and we cant have that in a civilized society and theres no point in having jurors the dope peddlers prevail you put all that together he is telling these people as the prosecutor in this county if you dont give this person the death penalty there will be all these adverse social consequences and you wrap all this up there is no conscientious prosecute who could possibly believe that these statements were proper no this argument is an outlier it is beyond the bounds it contains essentially improper comments in virtually every category that this court 
 so judge judge bowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor he dissented he thought these were not unreasonable on the basis of on clearly established law 
 i thought judge bowman said were it not for aedpa this case might come out in his view this case might have come out differently 
 judge bowman 
 the standard is unreasonable in light of clearly established law 
 judge bowman did say that but i believe the essence of his dissent was that i think that he made the mistake which the petitioners made in the cert petition and he thought that there was no clearly established federal law a point which is essentially conceded at this point in the proceedings i wanted to 
 well no he specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours and that there these other generally applicable decisions and he thought the state courts had broad a broader range when there was no decision on all fours 
 well if im im sorry 
 im reading at the bottom of page N in the petition appendix 
 well if im wrong about that im wrong but even i dont think it is also under justice oconnors opinion in williams versus taylor you dont have to this doesnt works at the level of saying well any one judge is unreasonable the point is its an objective standard not is this judge you know somehow out of touch here and i think so i wanted to make one point before i forge about it to correct one thing that petitioner said mr weaver filed this prior to the act it was dismissed he did request counsel and a coa he did appeal this in the eighth circuit in his first appeal he appealed the improper dismissal of his petition the district court initially granted the writ on batson grounds he appealed the fact that it should be his case should not be subject to the act 
 you have this only in a footnote in your reply brief it wasnt raised in the bio 
 it was not raised in the bio i did not represent mr weaver at that time but i thought it was my obligation as an officer of the court to raise this at the earliest possible opportunity 
 can i ask you where one of the passages that i thought went a little far where is he says to the jury the one thing you have have got to into your head this is far more important than william weaver this case goes far beyond william weaver this touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the world thats the message you have to send it just doesnt pertain to william weaver it pertains to all of us the community the message there are street et cetera okay now that struck me as you argue this is rather extreme its seems to be removing the attention of the jury from william weaver and saying you have a duty to send this man for other reasons now to execute him but where do i find in the us reports the case or statement that then says this is the kind of argument the prosecutor cannot make 
 okay let me i want to back up and i want to take on the premise of the question which may be a mistake but i think in determining the first part of the donnelly or darden standard is you look at what the prosecutor argued and whether it was improper i dont believe you have to have a united states supreme court case directly on point for everything the prosecutor said on that there are decisions from this court on a number of things he said there are also other touchstones for example the standards on criminal justice which regulate what prosecutors can say then the way i understand this clearly established federal law to work is you take what the prosecutor said you examine that in light of what happened what defense counsel did what the trial judge did and the weight of the overall evidence and if you believe that the prosecutors arguments rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair then theres a violation of the due process clause i dont think i have you have to show that theres some supreme court case directly on point going to each particular comment 
 you were talking 
 even even the supreme court cases going to the other points they didnt did any of them involve a separate penalty phase they were all just in the guilt guilt phase of a noncapital case werent they 
 well 
 so that so that when the prosecutor was urging particular action he was urging the jury to find a person guilty he was not just urging them what penalty is better or worse he was saying for these reasons you should find the individual guilty thats quite different it seems to me from the situation in which guilt has already been established the trials done this person is guilty and the only thing they are arguing about is what the penalty ought to be im not sure that you can analogize you know from the one situation to the other in determining what kind of argument is proper because in the former situation when the if the prosecutor says this is not just about this defendant its about the whole society hes urging the jury to find the person guilty i mean and thats crazy you dont find the person guilty in order to stop drug trafficking but you do impose a heavier penalty in order to do that so i just dont dont see the analogy from the supreme court cases you have 
 well i think that i dont see any reason why a principle which this court has repeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed to leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office behind a particular outcome would apply any less at the penalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase of a capital trial 
 thats different look it could could would defense counsel be able to argue during the guilt phase of the trial in an ordinary trial where theres no separate phase ladies and gentlemen of the jury this person has a large family thats dependent on him hes a miserable wretch you shouldnt find him guilt is there no mercy in your heart would he be allowed to argue that of course not can he argue it in a guilt phase of course he can and it seems to me in determining what arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided by what arguments the defense can make the defense can surely come in and say ladies and gentlemen of the jury you are being called upon to kill somebody do you realize what a what a difficult overwhelming thing that is and then you say the prosecution cant come in and say ladies and gentlemen sometimes if you do your duty you have to kill this is the law here if you find the facts this way thats your duty i i i think you are you are taking hard cases very much out of context by applying cases that relate to the guilt phase to a very special procedure that we have set up in capital cases which is called the guilt uh the penalty phase 
 well i disagree with that and to this extent can a lawyer in a capital case argue at the sentencing phase of the capital trial you should not sentence this person to death because they have had a hard life yes of course you can and why can you do that because according to this courts cases that goes directly to the individuals moral culpability and whether they deserve the death penalty the problem with many of the arguments which were made in this case is they are fundamentally inconsistent with the individuals moral blameworthiness and they can the jury to impose the death penalty in order to stop larger issues to stop crime to protect society 
 to to send a message 
 to send a message and if you dont send a message chaos will prevail and the animals will reign in the jungle 
 what the defense lawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote for life you are sending a message he said if you vote for life you are still doing your duty 
 yes 
 how was that message a different message i guess but he can say send a message but the prosecutor cant 
 no i think the important by the time defense counsel said that the prosecutor in his opening statement had already made the send a message statement about five times she was trying in that one limited instance to tackle that and say well okay if you give him life thats a message too 
 so if the prosecution had not opened the door that would have been improper you overrule the judge said counsel you cant argue about sending a message for life 
 i think that would have been completely within the trial courts discretion 
 you you think the trial court could tell the defense counsel that the defense counsel cannot argue to the jury ladies and gentlemen there is nothing more precious than life and thats what we are asking you to decide here and we want you to assert the values of this community that we value life you cant say that 
 maybe but i think that what she but what shes saying here though is directly responsive and that is also a factor which this court has noted in its decisions 
 suppose that you said explicitly the prosecutor which he didnt say but you are arguing basically it is a fair sort of an implication suppose he said there are a lot of drug dealers around and hes one of them and this sentencing phase isnt about just just isnt about william weaver it is about sending a message to the others and if you execute him even if you think he shouldnt be executed you dont think he ever should be but you see others will think that this is a message so do it just to give a message even if you think he never did it no matter what you think of him you think hes the best person in the world still execute him just to send a message now would that violate the constitution 
 of course 
 yes of course what case in the supreme court would you look to to show it did 
 i think it would there you would easily just look to this courts eighth amendment decisions which say 
 you dont find any one where anybody ever had an argument like that 
 right it wouldnt be an but it would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles 
 ah ah so you are saying we should look not just to if we try to look for exact identical arguments maybe we will get into that problem of having to uphold things we all know or is that right or what 
 well i think you know at some point right you can say well you dont have a case on point because no one has said anything so outrageous if a prosecutor went up and said look ladies and gentlemen the judge is going to tell you about aggravating and mitigating circumstances forget all that baloney go in there you know put all that out of your brain and give him death i dont think there would be any question 
 the question has been switched here counsel the question before us is not whether it was wrong even if you answer theres plenty of supreme court precedent even though none on these particular facts to convince me that he shouldnt have said it thats not the question before us the question before us is whether it violates fundamental unfairness whether its wrong to such an extent that it invalidates the whole prosecution and and sentence thats quite a different question i can acknowledge yeah the prosecutor you know shouldnt do it but that doesnt lead me to the automatically to the conclusion that the supreme court jurisprudence shows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that the that the verdict has to be set aside 
 well let me tackle that headon there were a number of improper comments made in this case most many of them a number of them were objected to and the objection was overruled some of them were not objected to the only instructions they got were two curative instructions on two points and a general evidence not arguments instruction so nothing was really done in the context to ameliorate the presence of these comments and despite what the petitioner says this was not a strong case for death the evidence of guilt was circumstantial and hotly contested even the prosecutor in his penalty phase acknowledged look he might be innocent but kill him anyway the state presented no additional evidence in aggravation of punishment mr weaver had no prior record other than a misdemeanor conviction there was substantial mitigating evidence presented regarding his character his good deeds and other things he had done in the community and his adaptability to confinement this was not a strong case for death so you take these comments which were they are trying to contrast this argument is worse than newlon in most respects it was made five weeks after he was told that this argument rendered another trial fundamentally unfair 
 your recital was not a complete picture of the case this was an assassination of a witness in a federal drug prosecution with how many shots to the head 
 i believe there were six 
 six and the jury determined unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that this was the guy who did it so you do have to look at the penalty phase in the context of those facts 
 i agree but to say that and they found and im not suggesting that thats not part of the totality of the proceedings but theres one significant point there that also i think needs to be taken into account he was a witness but he was also a drug dealer and involved in the drug trade and was a straw purchaser for these shurn families and in many instances 
 well serve him right i mean is that 
 im not suggesting it serves him right im suggesting that whether juries impose death often depends in part as well on the moral blameworthiness or how they perceived the victim this was not like witness an innocent witness this was somebody who was involved in that and that normally makes it more difficult for the prosecution to obtain a death sentence 
 what do you what should a prosecutors closing penalty phase argument look like what are the sorts of things that he should be talking about 
 i think in general they stick to the evidence they can argue that the nature and severity of the crime itself warrants the ultimate punishment and focus on the focus of the penalty phase is supposed to be on the individuals moral culpability and whether they deserve the death penalty based on what they did this argument most of this argument i believe as justice breyer suggested it went on for pages and there was no mention really in any substance of william weaver and what he had done 
 do you think moral culpability is the only factor that can be mentioned i thought you said earlier it was okay for the prosecutor to refer to deterrence 
 i dont think its the only factor but i was responding to the question of what should a prosecutor do and in fact what most prosecutors do in most cases 
 can a prosecutor say that killing a witness is something that needs to be deterred and therefore its important its appropriate to impose the death penalty here in order to send a message of deterrence is that improper 
 i think something probably like that would be but this again this went way beyond that the other thing that you have to look at here is that then he goes on to say and if you dont give him death chaos will reign society will fall apart theres no point in having a death penalty and the animals will reign in the jungle and you cant that have that in a civilized society 
 is part of moral culpability that you take moral instruction from thieves murderers on the street as opposed to those higher standards for which society seeks to aspire is that moral culpability 
 im sorry im not sure 
 is it moral culpability for you to take as an example for your behavior the criminal population 
 i still im not trying to be thick 
 you are talking about moral culpability is it part of your moral culpability that you take your values your instructions your behavior from criminals as opposed to people who uphold the law in society is that part of moral culpability 
 it might be part of the picture of what this person is like 
 well then isnt it relevant whats happening on the streets etcetera 
 i dont think its proper to say if you dont give this person death then all these other things which are bad for society are going to happen 
 of course the defense argument was not focused on weaver either the defense counsel said it was a vote for life fight for it always fight for life always always the argument by the defense wasnt and its hard for me to imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldnt extend beyond the particular individuals 
 but theres beyond and theres way beyond and theres beyond the pale and i think if you look at all these things that were said in this case i have read hundreds of these arguments no conscientious prosecutor could have thought that this was appropriate 
 how do you answer the argument fight for life always fight for life how do you answer that argument except by saying ladies and gentlemen sometimes sometimes its your duty to vote for death how else would you answer that argument 
 you could answer it that look at what this person did you look at his crime we have the death penalty in this state in some cases its appropriate its appropriate in this case its not appropriate to say im the prosecutor i decide in which cases we seek death 
 mr blume before your time is up i want to ask you one other question im still troubled about whether aedpa applies and was it argued in any court below was the question actually ruled on after an adversarial presentation as to whether aedpa applies or does not apply as i understand it it either does or it doesnt and it doesnt matter whether it was argued but was it discussed in any of the lower court decisions 
 you are talking about on the basis that he filed before the act 
 two days before the act 
 he filed before the act the district court dismissed and said believing erroneously 
 no i mean in this proceeding 
 it was argued in his initial habeas it was appealed to the eighth circuit because the eighth circuit initially granted the writ on batson grounds so he appealed it at that point and the eighth circuit said basically with very little analysis determined that aedpa applied because he had to refile after the act and aedpa applied to petitions filed after the act 
 and was that this habeas then he filed a subsequent habeas or what 
 it was the same habeas proceeding it was a continuation of the same it was then remanded back to the district court the district court granted the writ on this ground and then it went up on appeal i dont think he would have been under any obligation to appeal it again having sort of gotten a ruling on that in the same habeas proceeding 
 if the eighth circuit had had lawrence in front it it would have ruled differently or should it have ruled differently in respect to lawrence 
 i believe that im sorry i didnt mean to interrupt i believe lawrence makes clear that the district court made a fundamental mistake in law in dismissing his petition and should not be 
 under lawrence the eighth circuit would have been wrong 
 yes 
 and if lawrence had gone the other way then it also then it would be right in other words whether aedpa applies really is a function of our decision in lawrence 
 yes lawrence made clear what i think should have probably been clear beforehand that you didnt have to seek cert to this court in order to exhaust a petition but that was the basis of the district courts ruling thank you 
 thank you mr blume ms spillars you have four minutes remaining 
 thank you your honor i would like to address two points first it is not clearly established that deterrence arguments in closing arguments are improper and for good reason particularly because of the strength of this the evidence in this case and the fact that the respondent had killed a federal witness executionstyle to that extent as i understand the respondents argument the deterrence rises or falls on however the prosecutor has prefaced his deterrence argument if he says certain words to mitigate the deterrence argument however trials dont operate in terms of specific words that must be prespoken before an argument can be valid secondly in response to justice kennedys question previously i would advise that prosecutors should not use some arguments not necessarily the deterrence argument but not that in every instance they must not use those arguments this courts supervisory role in those kinds of cases allows this court to turn shoulds into musts for federal prosecutors but that is not the case here second thirdly the viereck case is in a historical context which we dont have here and the missouri supreme court did consider the penalty phase arguments at page N of the appendix the court specifically said we have reviewed the penalty phase arguments and then at page N the missouri supreme court distinguishes newlon and says that they do not rise to the level of the statements made in newlon so to that extent the missouri state court was not an unreasonable application of this courts precedents and deference should afforded to that state court decision for that reason we would ask that this case be reversed thank you 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in case N leegin creative leather products versus psks incorporated mr olson 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the per se illegality rule for resale price maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated misguided and anticompetitive it should be replaced with the same rule of reason standard that applies to other forms of vertically imposed marketing restrictions the sherman act bars only unreasonable restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a restraint is unreasonable per se rules should be rare and imposed only where the court is virtually certain based upon considerable economic experience that a practice is nearly invariably anticompetitive vertical minimum retail resale price maintenance are plainly not invariably anticompetitive in fact a broad consensus of economists and decisions of this court recognize that vertical restraints promote interbrand competition which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely if ever anticompetitive 
 there was an argument made mr olson that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context that in fact the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves in which case some might have held back 
 well the economists who have looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said that that would very rarely if ever be the case it certainly could not be the case in this industry in connection with this participant in the marketplace there are something like N dealers that the brighton products are sold through there are thousands and thousands of other competing dealers hundreds of products what the court has said repeatedly is that programs such as this may promote interbrand competition perhaps 
 mr olson suppose just the dealers in new york the retail dealers agreed among themselves on the price would that be lawful 
 no i think that that would be covered by a horizontal prohibition justice stevens 
 would you say that its per se unlawful 
 i think it would be as horizontal restraint among competing dealers it could be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was if it was involved the manufacturer in some way it could be dealt with by the rule of reason 
 why should that be any different from the arrangement where those dealers all got together in the convention and recommended to the manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of precisely the same dimensions why 
 what this court said in sylvania and said again in the state oil versus khan is that the manufacturer has very very little incentive to increase 
 no but im asking what if he did why should you draw a distinction 
 because the motivation for the arrangement if it comes from a manufacturer you are suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in a particular area would get together to impose this on a manufacturer i think its very unrealistic that that would happen 
 no they just passed a resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this vertical restraint and ways to do it should that be different from one in which the manufacturer does it independently 
 i think that if the manufacturer makes a decision whether its because dealers would like to see that happen or not as this court said in business electronic versus sharp electronics theres of course relationships between the dealers and the manufacturers that the dealers may have an interest in doing this because they may find for the same reason that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of products the record is clear in this case that this was an effective strategy for the brighton company the brighton leegin company thats manufacturing the brighton products to enter a very difficult and highly competitive marketplace and it was successful 
 maybe mr olson you could give us an example where the rule of reason would find a violation in this situation 
 well it might be a situation the economists have written about this say that it would be very rare and would require retailers with a strong powerful market power to impose a situation where the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a horizontal cartel that certainly was not involved in this case and that would probably be found to violate the rule of reason in addition it would probably be unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this court that was not an issue in this case the economists say that that would very seldom happen 
 you say very which economists i know the chicago school tends to want rule of reason and so forth professor sherer is an economist isnt he worked at the ftc for a long time a good expert in the field he points out the drug industry after you got rid of after you got rid of resale price maintenance the margins fell N percent the drug stores it went down N percent he says with blue jeans alone it saved american consumers $N million to get rid of it and his conclusion is as in the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance the restraints can impose massive anticonsumer benefits massive 
 well 
 what that sounds like is that if at least he who is an economist thinks if you get rid of dr miles every american will pay far more for the goods that they buy at retail now thats one economist of course there are other whose think differently so how should we decide this 
 well 
 should we overturn dr miles and run that risk 
 in in the vast majority of the economist whose have looked at this have come out to the opposite conclusion justice breyer secondly 
 we are supposed to count economists 
 no no i think that 
 is that how we decide it 
 but what this court what this court has repeatedly said that under circumstances such as this where theres a consensus among leading respected economists that is one factor theres another factor 
 well i havent seen a consensus a consensus isnt doesnt sherer and all these people doesnt that point of view count too 
 this is one factor that the court should consider and the court has considered in the past when dealing with something that the court itself has said is an anachronistic and chronologically schizoid rule to have a rule of reason for certain vertical restraints and a fixed rigid per se rule with respect to other vertical restraints the court the court itself has made those pronouncements the enforcing agencies have changed their view with respect and they are here today the antitrust division and the federal trade commission all of whom have announced that they believe that it is very rare for a rule such as this for an arrangement such as this to be anticompetitive 
 but it was not so long ago that the department of justice took a different view and of all of the vertical restraints this is the only one where congress has been a player i mean congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate and then it withdrew that theres no other restraint where they are has been congressional action where the argument could be made well congress is well aware of this the court should allow them to make the change if they so will 
 essentially the same argument was made in the sylvania at the time of the sylvania case the same argument was made just a term or two go in connection with the illinois tool case that dealt with tying arrangements the same argument was made in state oil versus khan this court has construed the antitrust laws as an expression by congress that the courts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the marketplace 
 but in those cases you didnt have the counterpart to millertydings and mcguire thats what makes this this one different in terms of congressional intention 
 the repeal of those statutes justice ginsburg repealed per se legality rules it was not a congressional expression against the rule of reason 
 no but there was in the patent case though mr olson we relied on the fact that the patent law changed 
 yes you did 
 yes 
 and that was a that was one factor however justice stevens i think as i read that opinion the court was also concerned with the fact that the the per se rule which and the court said the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the weyerhaeuser case to the extent theres practices that can be procompetitive the court should not set a low threshold of illegality especially low per se illegality threshold there were there have been it is worth emphasizing that the court has repeatedly said we dont want per se rules when we dont have a substantial body of economic experience that shows us that this practice 
 what about what about the reliance interest though i mean hasnt a whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance on the dr miles rule and dont we need to be concerned about the disruption to that established practice 
 theres really no evidence that the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the dr miles rule of N chief justice 
 isnt there evidence that the basically that the rise of the walmarts and the targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade so that theres that correlation 
 actually i looked into that justice souter and me my limited historical research is that the those discounters were coming on strong before N which is when the the consumer price whatever it was act was passed in response to that there are the evidence basically shows that and this court has said that its interbrand competition that ultimately produces lower prices 
 well i dont know we have you talked about just for fun i got out of the library a book by professor b s yamey called resale price maintenance where he has five economists now maybe you are not going to count them as economists now i didnt find in that book a single argument that isnt also in your briefs nor did i find in your brief as single argument that isnt in the book theres one interesting thing about the book it was written in N so i guess my question is whats changed now i know two things have changed one is theres evidence in canada britain and in the states that were under millertydings that when you got rid of resale price maintenance prices went down thats changed and the second thing thats changed is theres far more concentration i gather today in the retail side of the market than there are used to be a factor which makes resale price maintenance dangerous because its more likely to take place at the request of the dealers now i see those two changes my question to you is looking at yameys book which is called resale price maintenance so you might have found even it even on google and whats changed whats new 
 well a number of things have changed the the number of respected individuals notwithstanding that book who have looked at it and have focused on the marketplace have said that because it allows it increases the possibility of interbrand competition it can provide incentives for dealers to provide service differences in the products and other things that have happened since then are this courts decision in the sylvania case which which involved an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the ruling the reason for a per se rule this courts decision in state oil versus khan and the other cases that this court is very well aware of where per se rules have systematically been dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the marketplace this 
 mr olson does brand competition generally help retailers or is this a question that cant be answered 
 did you say inter 
 interbrand interbrand competition do retailers like interbrand competition 
 well i dont know that i dont know whether people like competition but the antitrust laws like competition and this court likes competition and this court has said that interbrand 
 well but we are talking about inter we are talking about retailers it it seems to me at the outset of the argument you you acknowledged and i think it is the general rule that if the retailers themselves have this resale price maintenance it is invalid well if the manufacturer does this just for the convenience of the retailers and thats many of the examples in your brief it is for the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers then why shouldnt there be a per se rule why should we allow the manufacturer to do something we that wouldnt allow the retailers to do if its for the retailers 
 well the manufacturer is very unlikely to do this for the convenience of the retailers to because its in the interest of the manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the manufacturers products as possible 
 if if if indeed thats thats what hes aiming at low price is it the object of the is the sole object of the sherman act to produce low prices 
 no 
 i thought it was consumer welfare 
 yes yes it is 
 and i thought some consumers would prefer more service at a higher price 
 precisely 
 so the mere fact that it would increase prices doesnt prove anything it doesnt prove that its serving consumer welfare if in fact its giving the consumer a choice of more service at a somewhat higher price that would enhance consumer welfare so long as there are competitive products at a lower price wouldnt it 
 thats thats absolutely correct 
 so i dont know why why we should have to focus our entire attention on whether its going to going to produce higher prices or not the market out there has different goods at different prices which have different qualities that attract different consumers 
 i i agree completely i would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal but let me say that thats what this court has said over and over again if you the purpose of the antitrust laws is not price but its competition because competition between competing manufacturers give the consumers more choice some people may want the cheapest product some people may want the product thats more available to them they may wish the return policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that the dealer provides and in this marketplace particularly that system of providing competition is consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced success in the marketplace 
 mr olson before you sit down theres just one thing that wasnt covered in your argument or in the brief but the complaint alleged in this case that leegin allowed certain favored dealers to discount this plaintiff but others were allowed to discount and if that were true as a matter of fact then that would be a a plain violation of antitrust law wouldnt it 
 this but the case was never litigated on that basis it wasnt considered on that basis in the court of appeals it came up sort of as a late thought in the opposition to the petition for certiorari but that is not this case the case was litigated on the per se rule of dr miles 
 thank you mr olson 
 in the complaint 
 thank you mr olson mr hungar 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the same considerations that led this court in sylvania and state oil to reject outmoded per se rules compel that same result here the dr miles rule conflicts with this courts modern antitrust jurisprudence in three fatal 
 maybe i will put my question which is really just one for this i understand perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing differ things of course resale price maintenance does raise prices and it is very often anticompetitive of course sometimes there are good reasons for it that might help consumers now in addition you need clear rules now those three sets of things require a balance and we have a hundred years of history where this court and congress and others have balanced those three sets of considerations and they have come out one way now the department of justice wants to rebalance them and come out the other way there are good arguments on both sides why should we overrule a case thats N years old in the absence of any any congressional indication that thats a good idea when its simply a question in a difficult area of people reaching a slightly different weight on some these three sets of things 
 several reasons your honor its not its not a close question whether this court under its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial matter would impose a per se rule in this context there is economic there is consensus among the respected economists 
 i would think it is quite a close question 
 i dont think you your honor given that 
 all right even so go ahead 
 given that this courts test the question this courts modern cases ask in distinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se rule is whether the challenged conduct is always or almost always anticompetitive thats what the court has said 
 price fixing horizontal i guess or territorial divisions we should overturn those too 
 certainly not your honor because that that is almost always anticompetitive in our experience and in the experience of the courts but the same is not true in the resale price maintenance context dr miles has foreclosed the courts from conducting the kind of analysis that would actually look into this question but the empirical data that are available would suggest that anticompetitive explanations for resale price maintenance do not have very much explanatory power when you actually look at the cases that have been litigated they involve manufacturers without market power unconcentrated markets no evidence in the vast majority of those cases of any cartelization going on so the anticompetitive explanations while certainly valid in some cases do not appear to explain most of the retail price maintenance that has been litigated its true that retail price maintenance can but does not always result in price increases but as justice scalia pointed out price is not the only thing that consumers care about and there is widespread consensus in the economic literature and in this courts recent cases that pricebased vertical restraints just like nonprice based vertical restraints while they generally reduce intrabrand competition generally enhance interbrand competition in monsanto and business electronics this court made clear that price vertical restraints like minimum resale price maintenance frequently in fact usually have the same or similar effects to the nonprice vertical restraints to which this court now applies rule of reason analysis so the reason in 
 wouldnt your argument also apply to a conspiracy among the new york dealers in this product just to fix prices because theres plenty of interbrand competition i think i dont think you can say its absolutely clear that that would always be anticompetitive because they would also agree to provide additional services 
 no your honor because horizontal the important thing to keep in mind is that the incentive of the manufacturer when the manufacturer 
 im talking about a case in which its the dealers who want to agree to provide extra services at higher prices as their method of better serving the public and they all agree that they have to be conscious about the competition from other brands why can we be absolutely certain thats always going to be harmful to the consumer 
 your honor the reason why we know that is always or almost always harmful is that the incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel just like the incentives of the participants in a manufacturing cartel 
 they might be precisely the statement as the manufacturers we think we will make more all make more money if we concentrate on service rather than price 
 no your honor because the manufacturers incentive is not to increase the profits of the retailers but the retailers when they get together obviously have a very different incentive which is not to benefit the manufacturer 
 what you say is right what you say there is right i feel im back in N the argument against that is we dont know which way the push comes the large retailers home depot whatever they are huge retailers they want or maybe it isnt the discounters its some other once we dont know which way you are throwing it into court you are throwing it before N people who may or may not work this thing out so the argument against what you are saying is not logic its empirical and administrative 
 your honor 
 thats what it was thats what it is now i guess 
 your honor in state oil the same argument was made the argument was made that while we dont have compelling empirical evidence that albrecht results in harm to the economy we dont have compelling empirical evidence that resale price maintenance maximum resale price maintenance is generally procompetitive and in the absence of such empirical evidence theres no basis for overturning precedent this court unanimously 
 we do have empirical evidence though dont we that the decision of this case is going to be very significant in the sort of battle between walmart and the main street stores and why should this court in effect take a shot in the dark at resolving that as distinct from leaving it to congress which is in a position to know more about where the shot is going to land than we are 
 this court im sorry theres no empirical evidence that im aware of about what impact eliminating dr miles would have on the walmarts of the world 
 thats my point but it seems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence that the success of the walmarts and the targets and the home depots was a success which was correlated with the elimination of price maintenance by the states 
 i dont think so your honor in fact as mr olson pointed out the kmarts of the world began during the fair trade era 
 they began but they have flourished in the postfair trade era 
 yes your honor but i think considerations likes the opening up of international trade and the development of markets like china to supply lowcost goods have a lot more to do with the success of the walmarts of the world than a rule like dr miles remember its perfectly legal under current law for manufacturers to impose the same sort of constraints as long as they do it by fiat and unilateral enforcement rather than by agreement so the suggestion that somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy if dr miles is overruled is simply unsupportable 
 well then whats the great benefit then in changing the rule if its perfectly legal to achieve the same result already 
 as the ping amicus brief the ping golf club manufacturer amicus brief indicates its extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the colgate regime that for those manufacturers for whom resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy like leegin its more efficient to do it in many circumstances by agreement rather than the disruption that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without further discussion for discounting one item in order to keep your policy in place 
 but doesnt that answer your argument that there isnt reason to believe that there is going to be disruption if dr miles goes because now its going to be easy 
 your honor in N during the height of the fair trade era the ftc did a study which concluded only about N percent of the economy was affected by fair trade and the fair trade regime remember is a different and more extreme regime there it was per se legality not rule of reason so its just theres just no basis for these assertions that somehow the economy is going to be massively changed but it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance it will enhance its ability to compete and it will provide consumers more of what they want and that is a good thing and the antitrust laws should not automatically foreclose that merely because in a small percentage of cases it is conceivable that there can be anticompetitive effects 
 isnt it fair to say that there is reason to believe that there may be a massive reorientation in the retail economy if dr miles goes and that gets to my problem why should we be the people to make a guess as opposed to the congress as the institution to make the guess 
 im not aware of any reason to believe that your honor based on the historical record and based on the modern realities the walmarts of the world have succeeded because of their discounting strategy thats not going to change and manufacturers have an incentive to have their goods sold through those stores and thats not going to change either in the vast majority of cases and with respect 
 if the rule of reason is the one that applies i gathered perhaps incorrectly from mr olsons remarks that this would be this case would be thrown out on summary judgment it would never get to trial how do you think the rule of reason would operate if it were the rubric under which this case were to be decided 
 your honor i think it would operate as it does usually which is the plaintiff would be required to establish an anticompetitive effect resulting from the challenged conduct and once that burden is overcome the defendant would be required to come up with some legitimate business justification some procompetitive results that outweigh that and only if they could do that would they succeed 
 well thats the formula but i take it from what you said and mr olson said that the plaintiff could never get across the first threshold 
 we dont agree with that your honor in cases where resale price maintenance is being used to facilitate cartelization either at the manufacturer or the retail level the plaintiff could prevail also in for example in an oligopolistic market 
 but in this case this case has none of those features 
 well right 
 leegin loses under the rule of reason right 
 we dont know that it seems likely to assume that though and thats not a bad thing leegin is obviously not dominant in the market its obviously not going to succeed unless what it is offering at a higher price is what consumers want and that is a good thing under the antitrust laws 
 thank you mr hungar 
 thank you 
 mr coykendall 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court as recently as last month this court restated a guiding principle of antitrust jurisprudence discouraging price cuts and depriving consumers of low prices is bad antitrust policy rpm prohibits price 
 is that right i mean you really think that antitrust policy means when any arrangement that produce a higher price is bad 
 well we arent talking about any arrangement 
 i mean a lot of consumers want you know extended warranties they want show rooms where they can go and look at things all of which costs more money and where you can not have resale price maintenance the customers or you have the free rider problem the customers shop at the place that has the big show room likes at all the product there and goes and buys it from somebody else who has not incurred that expense now i just dont think that all the customers want is cheap i think they want other things besides cheap i think they want service i think they want selection i think they want the ability to view goods and so forth why do you discount all of those things 
 i dont discount all those things all those things are available under our current regime where we have a per se prohibition against resale price maintenance 
 well they arent available this company thought that it could provide higher service if it could assure its retailers that they would not be undercut by people who are not providing that kind of service 
 and theres no question that even the plaintiff in this case was providing that service he was providing it more efficiently and he just wanted to pass those efficiencies on 
 i dont i dont know that theres no question about that theres certainly no question that this company was successful in breaking into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the service 
 the record shows that with this specific company most of the growth of its sales occurred before it established a resale price maintenance policy so there are no demonstrated benefits from this company of imposing and enforcing a resale price maintenance policy 
 what is your main objection to i mean its hard to propose a rule of reason why why cant the rule of reason work to promote the objectives you have just articulated 
 well as a practical matter for someone in my position or plaintiffs position its impossible for a small dealer to muster the resources in order to put forth chief justice 
 for a small dealer but as we have already heard the dealers who engage in the discount policy are prices like target and walmart those arent small dealers those are behemoths in the retailing industry 
 i would suggest that those are not the people that really are being protected by this particular per se prohibition it is the small mom and pop operation like my client that wants to innovate and expand and pass on efficiencies and compete with the big discounters who might have power of their own in order to secure discounts 
 so you dont agree with the argument that we have heard this morning that the transformation of american retailing since the N s and the rise of the largescale lowprice retailers has anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and that overruling dr miles would reverse that 
 no i absolutely agree with that but its resale price maintenance that enables these initiators these small companies these small operations to grow and innovate achieve the efficiencies and pass those on attract customers by reducing prices and all that is stopped by imposition of a resale price 
 is there anything to suggest that the largescale lowprice retailers who were supposedly dependent on dr miles are support its retention have they filed amicus briefs here or otherwise suggested that this is essential to their continuing operation 
 again the largescale dominant players in the retail industry have their own market power they dont need the protection of the per se rule in order to enforce them its the next generation that this rule really aims to protect 
 i dont understand that i mean if it was really the case that they were going to be losing losing profits i think they would have been here i mean we talk about the walmarts and the targets they are not here on amicus briefs because they are what they are selling is cheap they are selling price and people who want low price and for whom thats of value above all other things are going to continue to go to those stores so they are not going to be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to provide not just the low price of course they will try to keep the price as low as possible but service i just dont see what what harm can possibly come so long as theres no market dominance from allowing some people to make their money on service and rather than cheap price 
 well again i would suggest that under this current system the way it is we have both the full service providers of complete service that offer goods at a certain price and we have discounters selling those same goods there is currently a mix of service and price that better serves the economy than just having one cookie cutter a one size fits all approach that you would have with resale price maintenance 
 well i thought the per se rule was the cookie cutter approach 
 well in terms of prohibiting price or in terms of yes prohibiting price fixing thats true but it permits stores to have full price and full service and charge high prices for that service and it permits discounters to reduce price reduce service and cater to those customers who want the goods with lower service 
 the internet is it you would have said four years ago or i think we are in this argument you would have said that its the large discounters the growing discounters the walgreens of the world who want to get rid of retail price maintenance its there to help the mom and pops okay they are in now they are big and they may want to maintain resale prices because they may want to extract the other profit while the internet little company comes in and says i can get it to you cheaper now i can imagine circumstances like you say i can imagine they are not like you say i dont know and so what should i do if i really dont know 
 well there is no doubt that resale price maintenance raises prices to consumers the only economic doubt is whether there are any redeeming effects of those prices and thats where the economic dispute of this is 
 well i thought the ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that it made the prices may be resale price the current dr miles rule may result in increased prices because of the inefficiencies for those retailers or of those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where something other than price is important and they have to do that unilaterally which increases inefficiencies 
 well your honor i would suggest that first of all eliminating the per se rule would not decrease the inefficiencies of the colgate doctrine if they want to impose resale price maintenance in order to avoid even a rule of reasoned approach they would have to go 
 even with the tremendous anomaly that the employer that the the manufacturer cannot do this by agreement but he can do it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that wont go along those two are substitute of each other colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but we are not going to let you do it by agreement you have to do it on your own and then you have to do the draconian thing of terminating the dealer 
 i believe that anomaly really lies at the heart of the sherman antitrust act which is aimed at contracts combinations and conspiracies unilateral conduct isnt reached by that its the price of being in a fair country people can deal in ways that they want to with this particular issue but again eliminating the per se rule will not help ping out if they want to maintain their retail price maintenance as legal as unilateral they will still have to go through these same machinations 
 why is that why cant eliminating the rule i thought the whole point was they would just put in their contracts you have to sell it at this price and they could enforce the contracts rather than having to have these machinations of making sure they dont do anything that looks like an agreement with their retailers 
 well again then they would be subject to a rule of reason analysis and the uncertainties occasioned with that as to whether this contract is lawful if they want to avoid that then of course they would have to stick with the colgate doctrine your honor this particular case we have clear evidence that rpm was used to facilitate a horizontal retailer cartel we have evidence in the briefs that leegin would gather its dealers in a dealer meeting discuss the policy agree to changes and reach a consensus and then enforce that policy against everyone one of the evils of resale price maintenance is specifically this it does facilitate the formation of cartels 
 yeah but the conspiracy that it facilitated was just with intrabrand competition there wasnt conspiracy that affected interbrand competition 
 retail 
 so im not sure that economically it makes any difference whether the dealers are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was or they all did it at the same time 
 horizontal conspiracies even among a single brand has always been a per se violation of the antitrust law you can look back at the 
 no but if we say the rule or reason should apply to all cases that just affect intrabrand competition im not sure why we should keep this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that only affect intrabrand competition 
 there you are striking really at the heart of the the heart of the sherman act et al holding that horizontal conspiracies which nobody believes promote competition could be justified under the same thinking 
 no but its a totally i cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers could ever produce consumer welfare it will be a horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the consumer but whereas the manufacturer who wants to impose resale price maintenance his interest isnt to give the retailer as much more money than the retailer is now making hes going to try to keep their margin just as low as it ever was so that he can sell as many of his products as possible consistent with his desire to sell his product by attaching to it more service better warranty more showrooms whatever you know horizontal conspiracy the incentives are entirely different when you are dealing with a manufacturer it seems to me his incentive is still to keep the price as low as possible consistent with the additional good that he wants to give consumers to attract those consumers to his product 
 in this particular case there is a complete alignment of incentives because the manufacturer was also a retailer competing in this market he has the incentive to increase retailer profits 
 well if thats the case and if that makes a difference the rule of reason would allow you to make that argument but you but you want to say its bad across the board for everybody if indeed theres something peculiar about this case the rule of reason would allow you to argue that 
 well your honor we would suggest that the horizontal conspiracy between leegin as a retailer and the other retailers offering his products is more than just a rule of reason approach that would be per se illegal under this courts precedents retail price maintenance also has the problem we discussed earlier of perpetuating incumbent forms of distribution at the expense of the innovative and more efficient distribution means retailers in retail competition matters retailers should be entitled to innovate pass efficiencies along to customers in the form of lower prices attract new customers and grow in that manner 
 mr coykendall the on the question you alleged in the complaint that there was some discounting allowed by how do you pronounce it leegin 
 leegin 
 leegin and mr olson says that that wasnt pursued at trial is that correct 
 that particular aspect was referred to it wasnt pursued as a separate part of this prior to trial the judge did rule that the dr miles line of cases applied and the conduct would be judged under the per se rule so certain aspects with respect to the horizontal conspiracy and the differences in discounts i mean developed that much 
 suppose you were to lose you would still have that claim i take it 
 well yes we would suggest the record is sufficient that on remand the instruction given the jury as to the standard by which their conduct could be judged could be sustained as a per se violation under the rules related to horizontal conspiracies as well and again i would suggest that perhaps if the court doesnt reach that it should remand to the fifth circuit for them to consider whether that is a possibility resale price maintenance can distort consumer choice the retailers so the person comes into the store the retailers can exercise pressure to influence the selection of higher margin products over ones that may better fit the consumer needs that is an evil of resale price maintenance whether or not it does promote efficiencies and if resale price maintenance does act as it is theorized to increase retailer services some consumers will be worse off they will be paying for services they dont want there are alternatives to rpm 
 i dont suppose theres any i dont suppose theres any way to protect against the fallout to the consumer is there i mean if indeed if indeed a store presses on a consumer a product thats more expensive than what he needs or and what he wants is this a real argument against this that theres some stupid consumers whose can be conned i mean whatever rule we adopt thats going to be the situation 
 well if what you are doing is you are building in this high margin that gives the retailer an incentive to do that if there is no resale price maintenance so that margin isnt guaranteed the incentive disappears what is clear is that retail resale price maintenance is a blunt instrument to achieve any economies 
 you are assuming that the that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale price good why do you assume that 
 thats the only incentive the only reason for imposing resale prices 
 hes only going to be given the thing if he does the kind of additional service that the manufacturer wants thats the whole purpose of it and the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin just as low as he can consistent with the you know consistent with selling as many products as he can 
 well there are more efficient ways than rpm to achieve any benefits of efficiency such as contracts with the retailers to provide those additional demand creating services he could pay the retailers to provide those services he could provide those services directly i would suggest 
 why would you argue that those are more efficient than resale price maintenance 
 the resale price maintenance amounts to nothing more than throwing money at the problem you are guaranteeing a margin and you are hoping that its going to be used somehow for the consumers benefit and you have got no guarantee that any dealer is going to use the margin that they are guaranteed in any way to service the consumers and i would suggest that in geographically isolated areas 
 well you can add the contractual provisions you were talking about to a contract that has a minimum resale price the minimum resale price is to take away the incentive from the retailer not to carry through on the nonprice aspects 
 if you have a contract requiring those services you dont need the minimum resale price thats just completely unnecessary and that would prohibit the efficient dealer from passing on those efficiencies to its consumers 
 does that presume a contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for the service 
 it could be it may not 
 if not i dont see how that would work under your rule 
 well under the idea is the manufacturer chooses to deal with only those dealers that offer this particular service they sign a contract to provide that service if they dont want to provide that service they dont sign the contract these dont get the goods its as simple as that if the question is providing a larger margin to the dealer the most efficient way is for the manufacturer simply to lower their wholesale price and the margin the dealer receives is higher again if there are other efficiencies they might be achieved by exclusive territories as permitted by sylvania or by the colgate doctrine i would suggest the experience of the N years following the elimination of the fair trade laws have shown the wisdom of the dr miles decision which places faith in the free market system this court should continue to honor its precedents and respect the will of congress by adhering to the dr miles rule 
 your reference to the will of congress they havent enacted legislation that supports the result you seek 
 your honor as this court observed in sylvania congress by repealing the millertydings mcguire act did indicate its support for the per se rule i believe the court should adhere to that holding as well 
 thank you counsel ms underwood 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court when a manufacturer agrees with its retailers to fix a minimum resale price the whole point of the agreement is to prevent price competition among retailers to prevent discounts for almost N years the court has interpreted section N of the sherman act to prohibit such price fixing agreements any change in that fundamental understanding of the statute should be made by congress and not by this court the per se rule against resale price maintenance is different in at least three ways from other antitrust rules that this court has overturned first unlike the other rules it alone has been settled law for a century reaffirmed over and over again by this court 
 well its also been settled law for N years under the colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results albeit more inefficiently doesnt it make sense to allow them to adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already completely legal 
 no that tension that you that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a result of the fact that the antitrust rule law does not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior it prohibits agreements that are anti that restrain competition and so it will often be the case that it is possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that has the same effect as an agreement or approximately the same effect as the antitrust law simply draws that line because of a different value a value in preserving the independent action of individuals it is however 
 im not sure its often the case give me some other examples where you can achieve the same industrywide effect unilaterally 
 well as you have observed virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing function and become one entity instead of two entities then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is eliminated and the manufacturer if he simply integrates the whole function is can fix prices fix his what are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of the antitrust laws there are other reasons why a manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that integration but it is certainly possible by ceasing to be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid the prohibitions of the antitrust law it is also so this is old and well settled unlike the schwinn rule against territorial restraints which was overturned only N years after it was established or the albrecht rule against maximum resale price maintenance which was overturned N years after it was established this has a much more settled pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up around it second it was endorsed and relied on by congress not enacted by congress but endorsed and relied on by congress when congress repealed the fair trade laws in N by amending the very statute this court is now asked to interpret 
 were they relying on dr miles or were they relying on us thats the question 
 they were relying 
 they left the situation where it was which is that the antitrust law is as determined by this court and we had shown our willingness to update the antitrust law when sound economic doctrine suggests is necessary 
 no the legislative history described in some detail in the antitrust institutes brief shows that actually they were returning the law to the per se rule against resale price maintenance because they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should be prohibited this is it is also true that 
 but of course they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear they didnt do that here 
 thats true they did not do that here and im not suggesting that they did only that uniquely among the rules that this court has established in the antitrust area this rule has received the repeated attention of congress and so the courts deference to congress and reluctance to overturn the rule should be at its peek as compared with those other rules and third price is different this court has said that price competition is the central nervous system of the economy other restraints to be sure might indirectly affect price but not with the same absolute force territorial restraints dont absolutely prevent price competition because customers can travel or order by phone mail or internet and indeed under territorial restraints there are often multiple retailers in a particular territory who can compete maximum price maintenance doesnt prevent competition at all unless as the court noted in khan its really minimum resale price maintenance in disguise in which case the court in khan said its illegal manufacturers can of course pay retailers for the services that enhance the product that are being advanced as the procompetition benefit of resale price maintenance but the question for this court is whether the manufacturer should be allowed to use a pricefixing agreement to make that payment to buy those services and thats not a question of fact for a jury to decide in a rule of reason trial thats a question of statutory interpretation for this court its a question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer can use to buy those retailer services its also true that the claim that pricefixing works to induce those services is both debatable and untested the retailers have no obligations to provide services under the retail price maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other cases 
 but they could i mean you could easily write the agreement saying you have to charge this much and because you have to charge this much you also have to provide the training the service whatever the nonprice inducements are 
 you could you could also require those things without resale price maintenance and then the retailer would be free to decide to raise the price to pay for that or to provide it so efficiently that he could in effect engage 
 but then the retailer but then the retailer might have a real incentive not to do a good job on the service because they really want to market it for price not for service 
 that really depends doesnt it on what the consumers in the market want and if its correct if the manufacturer if the claim on behalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the customers want is service the retailers are in at least as good a position to identify that fact as not i think the point 
 well but there you have the free rider problem which is you go to the fancy show room you figure out what you want and then you buy it at the discount store 
 yes thats at its peak perhaps when you are talking about electronics when the shopping experience alone is what is thought to be the benefit which is often the case you cant free ride on that you either shop in the place where you like to shop or you shop or you have a different shopping experience in target 
 but some manufacturers want their product associated with excellent service high warranty and all of that and there is no way to get that uniformly for that product without this kind of agreement 
 yes there is the manufacturer can contract for it the manufacturer can decline to deal with people who dont provide it the very same point that was being made earlier i think that the point here is that permitting resale price maintenance would be such a drastic change in the longstanding settled interpretation of the sherman act that it doesnt really qualify as the kind of common law evolution that this court has said is appropriate ordinarily in making antitrust rules under the sherman act if that change is to be made at all it should be made by congress and not by this court 
 am i correct on the congressional point that there was a period when congress would have prohibited the solicitor general from making the argument he made today 
 yes there was such a period and this court noted that fact in 
 so there was a legislative expression of a position on this particular issue 
 there was a legislative expression of position on this particular issue 
 and that no longer is applicable 
 that is the solicitor general is no longer barred from making that argument as is evidenced today what he 
 i guess congress changed its mind then 
 no i think congress found it unnecessary or perhaps questioned the wisdom or constitutionality of barring the solicitor general from making particular arguments 
 i find it hard to believe that 
 but congress has consistently well and the repeal the reason the repeal of the millertydings act seems particularly relevant is that it is indeed it was an amendment to this statute that this court is being asked to interpret so it sheds some light on the on the meaning of this statute as it stands 
 as mr olson pointed out under the fair trade laws this was per se legal so thats kind of a different thing 
 yes but when congress repealed that there were considerable there was considerable expression of legislative history for those who find legislative history helpful that declared opposition to resale price maintenance not simply that it was sometimes helpful and sometimes hurtful so to the extent congresss intent can be gleaned from that legislative history it was an intent to return to the regime of per se illegality 
 maybe on the year by year dont spend any money on maybe congress decided that wasnt an appropriate technique but congress has used that after hasnt it in other cases 
 it has but i would question the wisdom of that technique as a method of expressing congresss views the fact that congress went so far as to use it once suggests a very strong view indeed 
 thank you ms underwood mr olson you have N minutes remaining 
 the respondent and its amici seem to recognize that what this court said in state oil versus khan that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition and by the way it enhances intrabrand competition on matters of service and availability and other things in addition to price the respondent and their amici seem to have acknowledged these procompetitive factors but say you should do it by a contract with N different retailers which you then have to go out and enforce or you have to do it under a colgate system which the ping brief demonstrates its a blunt instrument it requires terminating retailers with which you had a relationship for years it prohibits even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small problems 
 but you are just giving them an additional ground for termination 
 pardon me 
 you are just giving you are just suggesting we should give them an additional ground for termination 
 no what we are suggesting is that the agreement is something the details can be worked out the manufacturer can and the ping brief explains this the manufacturer can go to the retailer and say look maybe you didnt get it right your sales person said the wrong thing lets fix it because we want to be dealing together the antitrust laws in other word what the respondent and its amici want or they suggest forward integration so you just acquire all your retailers the benefits of these type of arrangements provide the consumers with choices it stimulates interbrand competition it promotes intrabrand competition on things other than price it provides consumers with more choices it ultimately gives more freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its products to enter the marketplace these are things that the court has said and provides a more varied market price the court has repeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of reason per se rules should be crossed out or not adopted unless they are dealing with a practice which is invariably anticompetitive this practice as acknowledged is procompetitive it provides many opportunities and it is irrational for vertical restrictions to exist in this world in the nonprice area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a rigid per se rule that cannot be changed and as this court has repeatedly held congress intended by the use of restraint of trade and the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the benefit of competition eliminating rigid per se rules which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do something thats rational in the marketplace to give consumer choices or to do it in some indirect way that is a lawyers dream and an entrepreneurs nightmare makes no sense at all for all those reasons the rule of reason in this area as in the other areas should replace the per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the end of the day thank you 
 thank you mr olson the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument this morning in case N tellabs inc versus makor issues and rights mr phillips 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court in N congress acted decisively to curb abusive private securities litigation it took the extraordinary step of rejecting categorically the traditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that are filed under the securities laws instead it declared that and this is at page N of our petition the complaint shall state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind the fundamental error in the court of appeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the statute the strong inference language that congress clearly intended to be not only in those statutes but obviously applied rigorously 
 at some point during your argument and i know you only have N minutes will you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading standard that the judge must follow is equivalent is the same as the instruction thats given to the jury because if it isnt then the seventh amendment argument may have some more force 
 i think the answer to the question is that it does not have to be the same i think congress actually has greater authority in dealing with pleadings that is distinct from the seventh amendment right but the court doesnt need to go that far in this particular case because i think the inferences that we are asking the court to draw from the record in this case would avoid any 
 well in writing i take it so far as the jury its just whether its more likely than not preponderance of the evidence 
 thats what the court held held in huddleston yes your honor 
 so your submission is maybe not in this case but insofar as your theory of the case that the trial judge can and in fact must basically apply a standard of fact standard of proof thats higher than that what the jury would 
 well its important as a standard of allegation because what we are talking about here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the plaintiffs so i do think its removed i mean this court has really never addressed the issue of the extent to which the seventh amendment extends to pleadings and i dont think this is the case in which to take up that issue because i think it is quite clear that what at least we are asking for as the appropriate interpretation of the reform act is that you need to apply that you simply follow matushita and monsanto and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that innocent explanations can be set aside and if you take that particular approach which clearly is consistent with the seventh amendment then it seems to me you the seventh that you followed under the constitution is eliminated 
 mr phillips the seventh amendment or not the question in N is has the plaintiff stated a claim and at the end of the line its has the plaintiff proved a claim but you are stating two different claims the claim that must be stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be proved and i dont know of any other instance where that is so 
 i dont know that there are any other instances in which thats true justice ginsburg but i dont think its a constitutional problem i think at the end of the day the question is does congress have the power to enforce its view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter of policy at the pleadings stage and i think the answer to that question is yes but again you dont have to 
 i wasnt asking it as a matter of constitutional law but im thinking how do you construe these words what is it strong inference and the words come out of as i understand it a second circuit decision so i would think the most logical thing is that youd look at the second circuit decision and say ah congress picked up those words from the second circuit decision then we should pick up the standards that the second circuit applied but your definition of strong inference is quite different from what the second circuits was 
 well im not sure thats N percent true i think the real problem with the second circuit is theres no monolithic second circuit rule thats out there the second circuit applied a number of cases under its particularity standards under N prior to the time congress adopted the strong inference standard some of them i think we would be very comfortable with the analysis in shields versus citytrust bank for instance the way judge jacobs analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way we are trying to analyze the complaint in this case so if you 
 mr phillips can i ask this question 
 im sorry 
 one of the amicus briefs talks in terms of the percentages how likely the inference the word strong inference means N percent N percent N percent do you think the inference has to be stronger or less strong than the inference of probable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to get access to the privacy of a home and so forth 
 i think it would have to be stronger than that although i dont know how to translate that into percentages justice stevens 
 a civil case would impose a higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case than they would for getting access to a citizens private papers and the like 
 i think the use of the language strong inference carries with it a very significant burden that has to be demonstrated by the buyer 
 a burden of over N percent 
 oh to be sure 
 in a criminal case the person seeking that action is a government officer who presumptively is not acting out of selfish motives whereas we are talking about private suits and some private litigants are selfish 
 absolutely justice scalia and if you read the securities industries amicus brief it ticks off all of the instances of harm that are caused by allowing too much of the private litigation is precisely that which congress was responding to 
 i just have to make it clear is the high likelihood or strong inference is greater than more likely than not 
 yes i believe congress would have intended it to be more 
 doesnt the doesnt the standard at the pleading stage have to be the same as the standard at the summary judgment stage if suppose that a certain set of facts is sufficient to defeat summary judgment if the plaintiff alleges all of those facts in the complaint are you saying that that complaint could be dismissed even though supporting those facts at the summary judgment stage would be enough to defeat a summary judgment motion 
 i think at the end of the day i would make that argument i dont have to make that argument here because its clear to me that the same standards of matushita and monsanto that say you have to exclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary judgment stage as we are trying to apply at the pleading stage so there is no disconnect but if i were actually forced into that position i think i would take that view although i probably would argue first that the standard of huddleston ought to be reconsidered rather than rejecting clearly what congress had in mind in N when it acted to curb the abuses of private securities litigation 
 but isnt the difference between matsushita and this particular case at least as you are presenting this case the the focused on the strength of this exclusion of innocent conduct as as i recall matsushita there there had to be at that stage there had to be evidence from which one could infer that the that the conduct was not innocent but you are arguing for something stronger than that you are arguing for in effect an an ultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct and arent you asking for more than just what matsushita did at at that later stage 
 i think there may be a slight semantic difference there but the truth is at end of the day all we are asking for the court to do is to evaluate the complaint taking both the positive and the negative inferences from it excluding ambiguities interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff as you traditionally do take into account whether there is an allegation of motive and say at the end of the day whether or not that reaches a rises to the level of a strong inference 
 but but matsushita as i recall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a plausible inference and i think you are arguing for something stronger than that and i think the language of congress forces you to do it but i im just finding it difficult to conclude to equate the plausibility standard in in matsushita with the strong inference standard here if you 
 well if im going to err on either side i obviously prefer that the court carries out congresss intent we thing you neednt go any further than matsushita did in order to reverse the court of appeals in this particular case obviously there is probably some potential distance between the two where you could certainly interpret the strong inference standard more in the line the way the united states interprets it as creating a high likelihood of scienter and we dont we are certainly not objecting to that we are just saying to the court that you neednt go that far in order to decide this case although obviously we would welcome a ruling along those lines if the courts inclined to go that far 
 is it fair to say at the pleading stage its the equivalent of a clear and convincing standard whereas at the end of the road it would only be more probable than not 
 well again i think it i think it puts an issue and we raised this in our reply brief whether or not huddleston should be reconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in the way congress is approaching private securities litigation but so my 
 so you do 
 there are a number of ways to go at it but if it turned out to be a disconnect that would not offend at least my sense of what congress was trying to achieve here 
 yeah well i dont think congress was trying to achieve an alteration in the ultimate standard either in the jury standard what it was concerned with is the enormous expense of of discovery and and tried to set a high wall to get to the discovery stage i dont know why that should have to affect or should logically affect the standard that the jury is told to use 
 all im suggesting is that if the court were concerned that somehow there is a disconnect between the pleading standard and the ultimate standard of proof the way to resolve that incongruity if it is one would to be reconsider the ultimate standard of proof not to throw out the clearly congressionally approved baby as part of that bath water 
 can you tell me a little bit of how how this should work in your view assume the ceo makes misstatements as to the earnings report and the acceptance of one of its new products just assume that 
 right 
 can we make a strong inference that a ceo knows what his own earnings reports are 
 you mean with a specific earnings report rather than just simply sort of sales projections and demand 
 can we make a strong inference that a ceo knows the status of current earnings 
 well my guess is they 
 when he makes when he makes a statement 
 well i think they would have to make an allegation that the that the ceo routinely is provided with that information rather than simply assume it i think its the same problem you have with their with their allegation that its common sense that ceos will act to protect their own personal self interest and the overall welfare of the company by misrepresenting the status of events 
 how about just saying that he knew it 
 im not 
 just saying that he knew it without saying why they knew that he knew it you are saying they have to give a reason why they knew that he knew it namely he routinely read these reports suppose they didnt say that they just said knowing that the that the figures were otherwise he he set them forth 
 i dont think thats sufficient because it requires for the facts that particularly show 
 but suppose it says which i think it did say that mr notebaert typically stayed on top of the companys financial health by having weekly conversations with other executives he had his hands on the pulse of the company he saw weekly sales reports and product projection production projections now it seems like an allegation thats very specific 
 but the but the problem with that allegation and we are talking about the N the titan N product specifically in that context the report is theres nothing in there that says what those reports say about the N and remember this is a case where the plaintiffs have N whistleblowers inside the company who could provide you with all of the detail in the world and yet when it comes time to tell you what was in the N report that would that would suggest that its not available theres not word one in the allegation 
 well i thought they alleged at least that for about a year previously in respect to the N that it was wrong known throughout the company that the N had been delayed dont they make an allegation like that 
 right but thats that being delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim the question was is the is the N being sold and that was the allegation and the answer to that is he i he had every reason to believe that based on what they have claimed because they have not produced a report or said that theres anything inside the report that says to the contrary about that again it seems to me 
 the N has long been delayed everyone knows that in the company so he knows its long been delayed 
 i think 
 then what he says is it is being shipped and delivered something like that 
 but justice breyer that that long been delayed period runs all the way back to N and we are talking about events in N and N so the notion that its been long delayed says nothing about what mr notebaert was was revealing in march and april and june of N it it could potentially but it equally it couldnt its the same problem you get with the N where the court of appeals specifically said it is quite plausible that mr notebaert never saw those reports now how you can make that concession and nevertheless say there is a strong inference that he acted to deceive strikes me as absolutely implausible 
 april N he says everything we can build we are building and shipping the demand is very strong and then what they say is of course nobody wanted any of it it was long delayed and they have known that since N and he has his finger on the pulse of the company 
 but you you justice breyer you make a leap there 
 oh yeah 
 is that they all knew that the point is they knew that it was delayed back in N what they dont do is tie that in to what he knew in N and that to me thats the central point in this case is do you require that kind of specificity and it seems to me theres no other way to read what congress says in this statute than to that id like to reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you mr phillips mr shanmugam 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court while meritorious private actions are an essential supplement to government enforcement of the securities laws abusive action impose substantial costs on companies and their shareholders as a cornerstone of its effort in the reform act to address the problem of abusive actions congress adopted uniform and more stringent pleading requirements including the strong inference requirement at issue in this case the court of appeals erred by holding that a plaintiff can satisfy that requirement simply by alleging facts which an inference of state of mind could be drawn the court of appeals thereby misinterpreted the reform act and 
 do you have a position on justice alitos earlier question about whether the standard at the summary judgment stage is the same as the standard at the pleading stage 
 first of all to be clear mr chief justice we dont believe that the court needs to address that question in this case because we dont believe that that sort of disparity would present any seventh amendment concerns however if the court does believe that any disparity in the degree of probability required does present seventh amendment concerns we believe that it is more consistent with congresss intent to apply the strong inference requirement at the proof stage as well as the pleading stage rather than to water down the strong inference requirement that congress adopted at the pleading stage and we believe that that requirement does impose a very high burden in our view it requires a plaintiff to allege facts that give rise to a high likelihood that the conclusion that the defendant acted with the necessary date of mind follows from those allegations 
 and by the proof stage you mean both summary judgment and submission to jury 
 i think that that is right justice kennedy i suppose that if the perceived constitutional concern is solely regarding the degree of likelihood that is required it could be applied simply at the summary judgment stage but to the extent that the court believes that it is a matter for the jury to determine whether a given set of facts gives rise to an inference of the requisite strength then yes the jury would need to be instructed in a manner consistent with the strong 
 what would you think about the following 
 may i just may i just very briefly putting aside the constitutional problem do you think the standards are the same or different between the pleading stage and the constitutional stage and the summary judgment stage 
 well again we dont believe that the court needs to address that question 
 i understand that thats not my question 
 and the statute by its terms only 
 it is either a yes or no question 
 well i think that the answer is yes if the court feels it needs to address that question and to be sure the strong inference standard that congress adopted was framed only in terms of the pleading stage and our view 
 there was a pleading stage i would like your clear view on how much that changes it has been the understanding that when there is a N motion you look only to the face of the complaint and you construe the allegations in that complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff is that rule not applied under the interpretation you are giving us of strong inference 
 i think that it is justice ginsburg to this limited extent in an ordinary civil case the case is governed of course by rule N and in some sense the rule that the allegations in the complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff is really derived from rule N and its requirement that a plaintiff need only provide a shortened claim statement of the relevant underlying facts in order to survive a motion to dismiss what congress did in the reform act was to require first of all some degree of particularity in allegation but congress went further than that and to the extent that congress spoke in terms of the inferences that can be drawn from those allegations we do believe that congress abrogated the background rule that the allegations must be read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff or as some courts have put it that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the complaint should be drawn in the plaintiffs favor that clearly is a change on the preexisting law and it is a change with regard to the law that circuits were applying before the enactment of the reform act 
 why dont we simply assume that the read most favorable to the plaintiff rule is still in place but that reading it most favorably to the plaintiff it must rise to the level of supporting the strong inference 
 i guess justice souter that i would wonder what it would mean to say that you read the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff if what it means is that a plaintiff can simply accumulate reasonable subsidiary inferences in order to create the strong inference of state of mind that is ultimately required then i think i would disagree that that rule remains in effect precisely because our view is that in applying the strong inference standard a court should consider other possible explanations for the defendants conduct that are not foreclosed by the allegations 
 well but i was using the word inference to to refer to some reasoning process based upon what is stated not on assumptions favorable to the plaintiff and if inference is to tie is is a term that is tied to what is alleged then i dont see any any contradiction between reading those allegations most favorably but saying the statute in each statute requires that the that the total force of the inference rise to the level of strength that you speak of 
 i think our only concern justice souter would be that where a plaintiff includes ambiguous allegations in the complaint a court should consider the possibility that those ambiguities work to the defendants favor as well as working to the plaintiffs favor and one concrete example of that in this case are the allegations that concern the titan N there are allegations in this case that there was a study and there were various internal reports that indicated that demand for that product was declining but the complaint does not specifically allege that that study and those internal reports were even available at the time the ceo made the alleged 
 mr shanmugam could could i get you back to to your your assertion of we dont have to reach in this case the question of whether the same standard applies at trial as as at the pleading stage it seems to me a seventh amendment claim has been raised its our usual policy to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication if indeed the two standards are the same theres certainly no seventh amendment problem so why dont we have to first of all decide in resolving the seventh amendment claim whether the two standards are the same 
 well that is certainly correct justice scalia but in our view there is no constitutional problem here and the reason that there is no constitutional problem here is in making the probabilistic determination that is required by the reform act a court is taking the allegations in the complaint as true it is not engaging in any weighing of the evidence 
 but you are getting to the merits of the constitutional problem and we usually run away from constitutional problems we dont even want to consider the merits of it and we dont have to if indeed the two standards are the same 
 well to the extent that the court views the constitutional issue in this case as sufficiently substantial to trigger the canon of constitutional avoidance then we do believe that the better view the view that is more consistent with congresss intent is that if the court is choosing between raising the standard at the pre stage and watering down the standard at the pleadings stage we believe that the former is more consistent with congresss 
 even if there is no seventh amendment problem what sense would it make to have a regime that says plaintiff has to plead more than the plaintiff has to show at summary judgment or prove at trial 
 well congress was concerned justice alito with the problem of abusive pleading that much is crystal clear and as part of that concern congress was concerned that plaintiffs could readily allege fraud by hindsight and congress may have been concerned that the plaintiff could do so not only by making a conclusory allegation of state of mind but also making a slightly less conclusory allegation of state of mind by alleging facts that merely give rise to a reasonable inference of state of mind if congress hadnt had that concern it obviously could have codified the reasonable inference standard that was then in use by a number of other courts 
 what do you think in writing this opinion there are a couple of ways one you can find strong inference in terms of some other words two you could look to history or three you could just try an example say strong inference means strong inference heres an example this is a complaint it meets it or it doesnt meet it which way in your opinion will work best in this case 
 justice breyer our primary concern in this case is with the way that the court of appeals articulated the applicable standard which we believe may have pernicious effects in future cases and so we certainly believe that it would be appropriate for the court to vacate and remand for the court of appeals to apply the correct standard but just to be clear 
 you said the court of appeals to apply it could the court of appeals applying the standard that you say is correct come to the same decision that it came to using a different verbal formula 
 in our view justice ginsburg applying the correct standard the decision of the court of appeals in this case should be reversed and if the case were remanded to the court of appeals for application of the standard we certainly think that the court of appeals should come out the other way 
 you had something else to say in answer to my question which i would like to hear 
 i think it was just that point justice breyer namely that if the court believes that it would be useful to provide guidance to the lower courts by applying the standard itself in this case we do believe that the decision of the court of appeals should be reversed rather than vacated 
 is the requisite standard knowledge of falsity 
 the requisite scienter is either intent or recklessness with regard to the underlying conduct at issue in effect 
 intent to make a false statement 
 yes thats right and in fact in misstatement cases that is knowledge of falsity 
 thank you mr shanmugam mr miller 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court we believe the seventh circuit had it right we believe that what the seventh circuit and this is in partial response to you justice breyer is take more or less a holistic view of the entirety of the complaint the business about the N the business about the N not being available when on december N N notebaert says its available the fact that they werent shipping it they werent selling it it didnt work and the extensive information from confidential sources that there were as one judge once referred to it accounting shenanigans going on designed to shift income into the fourth quarter of N we think that when the court looked at that it said looks to us as if theres 
 do we take judicial notice that a ceo knows these things and thats the strong inference 
 again you have confidential sources in this case and in the case notebaert is hands on hes talking to people hes on the phone all the time we are talking about the N 
 but you agree you have to have that you have to have some specific allegation to show of his knowledge we cant just infer that 
 i would think you should be able to infer it with the ceo i think the confidential sources demonstrate in this case he must have had it given his nature the status of these products his daytoday 
 the most suspicious thing in the complaint that i could find was where you say theres an internal market report and it revealed demand for the N was drying up and revenue would decline by N then you date that with in or about early N now i think if you knew or had reason to believe that it was prior to march or april of N you would have said so 
 if we knew 
 yeah and therefore theres quite a good chance here that this report was written after he made the statements what am i supposed to do with that i mean i know what you said and you said your best and thats your best 
 yes this notion of strategic ambiguity is in a sense humorous given the obstacles that a plaintiff has to get the goods so to speak just think about the investigation efforts that went into this case what you do justice breyer is and i think this is what the seventh circuit did look at everything look at the fact that you have got confidential sources saying N demand is drying up perhaps as early as middle N parts are not being ordered people are going home early verizon dropped N percent fourth quarter verizon dropped N percent in january you are the ceo you dont know that your flagship product is drying up that theres inventory that people are going home that your best customer doesnt know you anymore 
 you are arguing the facts and the inferences you said the seventh circuit got it right as i read their articulation of the standard on page N a of the petition appendix its the normal standard that would have been applied prior to the passage of the pslra could a reasonable person infer congress passes a law saying they have got to give rise to a strong inference shouldnt that have changed the standard 
 we believe two propositions number one you cant exceed the seventh amendment and the seventh circuit 
 i dont understand the seventh amendment argument here congress can surely articulate the standard thats going to be applied as a matter of substantive law if congress says you have to prove by clear and convincing evidence that doesnt interfere with the seventh amendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to that standard 
 that is correct chief justice but that is not what congress did congress did not elevate the burden of proof that is why mr phillips has asked you to in effect to overrule huddleston 
 well but congress just established an entry qualification for getting into court and there are a lot of entry qualifications in diversity cases you if you allege diversity and it existed at the outset thats fine that doesnt have to be proved at the end of the case indeed even if you prove the contrary the case is still validly there congress can establish entry requirements even when they differ from or have indeed nothing to do with the merits that the jury is supposed to decide 
 i think that is absolutely correct and indeed rule N has been an entry qualification since N but there are entry qualifications and there are entry qualifications in this case in effect the motion to dismiss operates as a dispositive motion it cuts off the ability to proceed at all and it does it if you listen to the standards being proposed by petitioner and by the united states 
 whats the difference between what justice scalia was just saying you cant come into federal court unless you have at least $N damages now you might have been just as much hurt if you had less but that would be constitutional so here you cant get into federal court unless you have a really strong claim an overwhelming claim that you have to demonstrate at the beginning now you might have a good claim but we are not going to let you come into federal court we only want those people who are really strong just as we only want those people who are really suffering 
 and did congress raise the burden 
 no no not the burden of its the entry 
 the entry points you referred to the socalled pleas in abatement to put on my common law hat a jurisdiction venue et cetera they may raise issues of fact and congress in control of the federal courts can calibrate it any way they want but when you are dealing with the core function of the jury and matters of abatement were never considered to be core functions of the jury i think a whole range of cases starting with slocum versus new york life 
 i thought you told me that congress could set a high level of burden on factual issues and that that wouldnt intrude upon the seventh amendment 
 im distinguishing mr chief justice between the merits and the entry point 
 are you saying that congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence 
 no no no no if congress wants to change preponderance to clear and convincing it can 
 so you would say that you could have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must be met at the pleading level but more likely than not at the jury level 
 no that is something i disagree with if the substance of the law 
 we want to know what the rule is 
 im not sure its the rule its what i would advocate if the substance says predominance then to raise the pleading bar on what in effect is a dispositive motion and i dont think it makes any difference whether its a jnov a directed verdict a summary judgment motion for judgment on the opening statement and you decided all of those cases and you protected what justice souter referred to in markman as the core function of the jury you have always said these procedures are okay as long as it does not call for the resolution of fact issues because thats the core function of the jury now this court is faced with in effect coming back down that time line to the motion to dismiss 
 if im with you so far why would you suppose that congress would create a different standard on the motion to dismiss than they meant to apply at the merits standard 
 i dont think congress would i do not believe congress ever intended its not in the statute it is not in the legislative history it is not in any case matsushita monsanto are unique antitrust cases and in both cases the court if you read the opinions fully protected the jury function they said there was simply nothing beyond the assertions standing alone when you have competitive and anticompetitive conduct to protect substantive antitrust law that doesnt do it 
 well then what was congress trying to do when they said strong inference it seems to me that if you think the standards have to be the same at pleading and at proof and congress says strong inference at pleading it means you have to show a strong inference at proof and thats why theres no seventh amendment problem 
 what you have to show at proof is preponderance 
 then it seems to me that you have the meaning of strong inference and reasonable inference 
 our standard as proposed and we think 
 you dont want to answer yes or no there 
 is reasonable jurors who are finders of fact could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants acted with scienter 
 so you are saying those words strong inference mean essentially the same thing as reasonable inference 
 no you can have lots of reasonable inferences that dont meet a preponderance notion 
 thats true but imagine a case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets forth every bit of testimony thats going to be heard on both sides and then you read that document and you conclude this is the weakest case i have ever heard but i do think a reasonable juror could find for the plaintiff and that would be the weak evidence standard and lo and behold that could be you know what do we do about that because using your do you send it to a jury test we could easily imagine cases where that meets the weak evidence standard the weak inference and not the strong inference and what im driving at is i dont see a way of avoiding this seventh amendment problem 
 if 
 because they certainly didnt intend the weak inference standard 
 if you follow petitioners in their attempt to deconstruct not simply rule N s construction but hundreds of years of what this court in jones versus bock referred to as usual procedural practices which are not to be lightly departed from the historic notion is you look at the complaint and in a curious way you have blinders on you look at the complaint you read it in the light favorable to the pleader you do not weigh that is a jury function you do not look for exculpatory explanations 
 how can you assess the strength of the inference that can be drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint without considering all the inferences that could be drawn from those facts i just dont understand that argument you see somebody lets say you saw somebody today walking east on pennsylvania avenue in the direction of capitol hill now you theres you could draw an inference that the person is coming to the supreme court and if there were no other building in washington that would be a very strong inference but dont you also have to consider the inference that the person is going to the capitol the person is going to the library of congress the person is going to some other location up here you have to consider all the inferences that you can draw from the facts 
 as the seventh circuit did we agree you look at the totality of the complaint thats a given but there are contrary inferences that undermine the strength of the plaintiffs inferences they weaken it and they are they emanate from the complaint there are other kinds of inferences lets call it nonculpability that dont denigrate the strong inference which lets assume hypothetically has been established they are just sidebar possibilities 
 well lets take one specific example that the petitioners did and that is this matter of the channel stuffing they say heres a notion channel stuffing it could mean goods were shipped that nobody ever ordered or it could mean something different it could mean discounting and other incentives to get people to buy so theres good channel stuffing and bad channel stuffing and it sounds like good cholesterol bad cholesterol you cant tell from the allegations that its the bad stuffing thats at issue 
 the seventh circuit reached that conclusion i think by looking at some of the confidential sources which sort of indicated that there was channel stuffing in the sense of pushing product out which was coming back the head of verizon complained about the channel stuffing so theres reason to believe that at least some of it is bad just enough now is that in and of itself determinative no again i come back to the notion that what the seventh circuit did is look at the N look at the N look at the earnings projections which proved false looked at backdating channel stuffing looked at all of that and said okay even if i treat channel stuffing as weak i have these other things and as judge lynch of the first circuit said each fact of scienter is like a brush stroke 
 are you entitled to consider the brush strokes that are not there as well as the subsidiary brush strokes that are in justice alitos example if the pleadings dont point out that the library of congress and the capitol are also up on this hill is the judge at the motions stage entitled to consider that 
 obviously if its something you can take judicial notice of then yes 
 okay then that is engaging in something more than construing the pleadings most favorably to the plaintiff 
 but its within the realm of what courts have done for the longest of the time they look at documents attached they look at judicial notice 
 what do you think about that there are at least some circumstances then in which there this is kind of critical assessment function that you concede must go on rather than simply a piling favorable inference onto favorable inference to see if it gets to the strong points 
 i repeat what i said a couple of minutes ago justice souter if the negative depletes the affirmative if theres a correlation between them i can understand that maybe it eliminates that fact maybe it reduces that fact but when we hear about motive what does motive and guidance reduction months after the false statements have to do with whether the statements were false whether the N was 
 that is that is an argument for the weight of considering motive rather than the relevance of the motive consideration per se 
 i think it is a tough line i think this is the kind of line district judges have to draw i think if you look at your own precedents like anderson versus liberty lobby and all of those jury trial cases you see the repetition of the notion that judges do not balance inference chains on a matter going to the core function of a jury 
 but all of those cases were before the pslra where congress it seems to me established a very different standard they said they have to support a strong inference 
 a strong inference not a conclusive inference 
 strong inference was not the test that was being applied in anderson liberty lobby in any of those cases 
 but cant but strong inference as justice ginsburg said much earlier was the standard not only in the second circuit but in the first circuit and in the third circuit 
 what do you think about the approach because i have had some of these cases and i see i think words words words and what congress said was strong inference and we are not going to get any further by looking for some other words so therefore take strong inference the most helpful thing is take it look at the complaint read it and then say okay this is a strong inference or maybe wed say it isnt we read it and avoid all the other issues what do you think about that 
 live to fight another day 
 right and then on appeal we would say no its not a strong inference or yes it is a strong inference i mean i hope we are going to establish some standards for how you go about determining whether theres a strong inference or not 
 and i hope we are going to recognize that congress thought it was doing something your argument so far professor doesnt indicate that congress 
 excuse me 
 you indicated that the you know the plaintiff had to do all this investigation the whole point of this was that the defendants were being disadvantaged 
 look at the statute in its entirety this isnt a statute that just deals with pleading scienter look at the provisions dealing with the selection of lead representative which has produced this incredible shift from N to public institutions pensions and labor unions they dont bring frivolous cases look at the control that statute gives over selection of them with notice provisions to make sure you have got the 
 how does that change how we should read strong inference in the statute are you saying dont worry whether its a strong inference or not because labor unions are bringing the cases and they are not going to bring a frivolous case no congress said there has to be a strong inference and what concerns me is that the very standard that the seventh circuit articulated said simply could a reasonable person infer the notion of strong inference isnt in that standard at all 
 the notion of strong inference starting with the second circuit doctrine as used in many other circuits was actually a much lower standard than what we are recommending if i believe if i think back at greenstone it was reason to believe or tends to believe or circumstantial evidence in greenstone and in burlington coat under our standard of preponderance the ability to find preponderance you are elevated you are also elevated by the preceding subdivision which requires a level of particularization never known in federal rule 
 mr miller going back just to the word strong forgetting the particularization from it do you think you can categorize the strength in percentage terms they have to be more than N percent more than probable cause we are talking all abstractly here and i find it easier to think when i think about numbers 
 i have forgive me i havent seen a judicial opinion that says at the N and onethird percentage of probability i have got to give it to the jury because that jury might file for my 
 i think its N and twothirds i think that is 
 is that because you never met a plaintiff you really liked 
 at least we know that in the probable world 
 i took a liberty there with the justice i dont think you can ascribe a percentage to it i think 
 well i think more likely than not most people think of N N percent can you tell us whether strong inference is stronger than more likely than not 
 i do not believe it is i think i think strong inference if we are doing the numbers game may actually be N percent if a district judge is looking again i say at the entirety of discounts 
 let me just reclaim the question is it stronger or weaker than probable cause in a criminal context 
 oh i would hope its stronger i would hope its higher than probable cause 
 what about clear and convincing is it below clear i mean they are the only two standards i actually understand without picking a number out of air is preponderance i think i can figure that out and i guess i can figure out beyond a reasonable doubt but other than those when you talking about strong when you talk about clear and convincing i have no idea what those things mean do you 
 and 
 you dont think they mean anything 
 no i think they mean what a district judge honoring his article iii commission concludes after an intensive evaluation of the entirety of the complaint looking for that strong inference putting on his sort of motion to dismiss N hat says okay 
 just okay 
 no i did not mean that dont take me literally on that for heavens sakes im from brooklyn im very colloquial im very sorry about that 
 let me write that down we should not take you literally all right 
 okay you two are even now 
 understand you keep asking quite properly obviously how does strong inference change anything the test we have proposed and the test i believe the seventh circuit applied is not the classic N have you stated a claim because we all know at least traditionally under notice pleading you can march through that this test if you follow that time line backward is in effect asking that district judge to make a decision on looking at the totality of this complaint is this case trial worthy its a curious thing i dont envy district judges who have to do this is it trial worthy why would congress say if a district judge is willing to say under the classic test i think its trial worthy theres no reason to believe that congress wanted to cut that case off 
 trial worthy under preponderance standard or trial worthy under the strong inference standard 
 oh i think he is becoming slightly schizoid he is saying im looking at strong inference im looking at the motion to dismiss structure as its been the usual procedure N years and i have to make a judgment because congress was pushing here theres no doubt about it i have to make a decision on the basis of what i have got which is virtually nothing lets face that i think i think if these allegations are proven it is certainly trial worthy 
 it sounds to me like 
 its not trial worthy but rather discovery worthy 
 im sorry justice stevens say it again 
 i think the question is not whether its trial worthy its whether its worthy for discovery thats really whats at issue in this 
 well the realities out there are they built a wall they put in all of these procedural protections and they said no discovery until you climb the wall now what kind of a wall was it was it a dutch dike or the berlin wall if you look at that statute contrary to what mr phillips urges there are multiple policies expressed in that statute one of which is private cases are good lets just get the right people to run those private cases lets control them lets lets have a greater threshold but lets not throw the baby out with the bath water because everybody seems to agree private cases help 
 i want i want to be fair i interpreted your argument and please tell me if this is incorrect as indicating that if i think strong inference is greater more onerous than more likely than not at the pleading stage i then also have to say this is the instruction that must be given to the jury in order to avoid the the discontinuity between the pleading stage and what 
 the way you state it justice is something very hard for me to respond to congress did not change the persuasiveness the proof burden if you go through the statute you will see spots where they did congress knew how to change proof standards congress knew how to change federal rules congress did not change the proof in private actions congress did not change all of the background procedure like the background procedure in jones and it is just not there yet congress did change a couple of federal rules explicitly so i i cannot comprehend how if the case reached the jury you would have to charge above predominance and i i think we have got a stone rolling downhill to the dismissal point which is why we have urged in the brief and why the seventh circuit was concerned as was the sixth about this jury trial implication 
 yeah and so i think we have to reach it because it cant possibly be you would instruct the jury you need a strong inference and it couldnt possibly be that a predominance standard if imported into the pleading would always mean a strong inference you see thats thats the dilemma and i dont see how to remain true to the words of the statute which are strong inference without actually producing a dichotomy and so either congress can do it or it cant and and and thats and we could fudge it by just you know avoiding it at this moment but i dont 
 mr miller suppose congress set up a entirely separate cause of action its caused its called a discovery cause of action okay and it sets forth as the condition for pursuing that cause of action a standard that your your allegation has to be indeed clear and convincing okay and then if you win that you can take whatever you get out of the discovery and bring a lawsuit would that be unconstitutional 
 why do i feel wind whipping past my ears as i go through a trap door 
 ironically ironically i think i have to say if congress leaving to one side justiciability problems with the discovery cause of action if congress created a discovery cause of action it could ascribe to it whatever incidents it wanted to 
 surely it could prohibit discovery altogether which it did before they adopt in N 
 that is correct and i dont think anybody seriously argues that discovery is a constitutional right the jury trial implications of this new cause of action are interesting this court has protected postN statutory claims and their right to jury trial but you are positing one that wasnt known in N and maybe it could be done without a jury thats really a hypothetical 
 thank you mr miller mr phillips you have four minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice i have to confess im im slightly perplexed by exactly what the respondents position is in this case so im inclined to kind of go back to the core points that have been raised by the questions from from the court and in the first instance it seems to me quite clear that the seventh circuit did not apply the strong inference standard if you can compare the language from the first circuit circuit that specifically says it has to be reasonable and strong strong has completely fallen out here i dont see any way to read it the other way i think in response to justice breyers question which is how do how should you write the opinion i think the meaningful way to write the opinion is to be respectful of justice scalias desire to provide guidance so i do think you should say you have to as justice alito said review the entirety of the document and and infer both positively and negatively as you go forward we know that has to be true almost every court thats dealt with these issues 
 but then you are doing away with reading the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff 
 absolutely absolutely justice ginsburg theres no question that thats that thats what congress had to have meant under these circumstances and the best example of that is the ceo who sells securities during the time period of the class action there are dozens of cases in which that happens does it create an inference of scienter it might because its quite possible that he sold and he lied about the stock in order to keep the price up to sell it is also possible that he sells only about N percent of the stock 
 but mr phillips you dont look at these things one at a time you look at them altogether 
 well that is 
 is the statute all you had 
 justice ginsburg i couldnt disagree with you more about that that is precisely what congress says when when it says with particularity and when congress says you have to look at each defendant you cannot do 
 it says you must plead the facts with particularity 
 yes 
 but when one judges the adequacy of the complaint one looks at all the facts pleaded with particularity not just one 
 but the strong inference of scienter is not pled on a group basis it has to be pled with respect to each individual defendant so its quite convenient 
 well i think that this case was a good example there were two defendants and the court of appeals 
 well there were a lot more than that 
 well to take the two that were at issue in this opinion the court of appeals said the ceo yeah theres enough there to get over that threshold the other guy no there wasnt so its not that shes saying what you find for one you find for all she is going at it defendant by defendant 
 well i i i mean i was commenting primarily on professor millers decision to just sort of sweep everything in and say look back in N and N when the seventh circuit itself specifically said that the knowledge for instance of the N decline didnt happen until march of N so i was just saying you cant start sweeping everything in but and it is true the court distinguished between those two individuals but the bottom line remains the same you have to analyze them each and you have to take into account contending inferences you have to construe ambiguity contrary to the plaintiff sometimes 
 what do you do with a report that you know exists because you had one of these N confidential people tell you but you havent seen the report so you dont have the date on it and you wont know that date unless you have access to discovery do you have to assume the date is later rather than sooner 
 i think you better make an allegation with particularity that that date was at a time when the individual would know that the that the information that he was conveying was was wrong i dont see how you can infer strongly 
 but you if the plaintiff 
 scienter otherwise 
 the plaintiff cant know for sure without seeing the document with a date on it 
 well the plaintiff can ask the confidential informant as much as as he wants about the information and if he cant come up with it thats the price you pay that was exactly what congress said is if you cannot make those particular allegations then you are out of luck and its not as though they give you one shot for this 
 congress congress used words strong inference those words are not selfdefining one can think of several ways in fact the courts of appeals did think of several ways why should we pick your way as opposed to the other ways one might define them 
 i could be flip to say its the right way but i think the i mean the answer to the the answer to why to choose our approach is because it is consistent with matsushita and monsanto and it will allow justice breyer to apply it in an individualized way in a fashion that will give guidance to the lower courts thank you 
 thank you mr phillips the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument this morning in case N fry versus pliler mr haltom 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the constitutional error that occurred in mr frys third trial is the type of error that can result in a conviction of an innocent person notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in mr frys trial no court has reviewed the effect of that error or evaluated the effect of that error under the constitutionally mandated chapman standard mr frys position is simply that he is entitled to one bite at the chapman apple in the california court of appeals that state appellate court should have but did not rectify the constitutional trial error that occurred in this case had that court complied with this courts precedent that court would have first identified the constitutional error that occurred at trial namely the chambers error and second reviewed the effect of that error assessed the effect of that error under the chapman test the failure of that court to do so the unreasonable decisionmaking of that court relegated mr fry to seeking relief in federal habeas proceedings it scarcely seems reasonable 
 i suppose he could have come here on direct 
 he could have your honor however he didnt have the right to counsel to come following his appeal to the state appellate court and then after the denial of his petition it would be a discretionary review in the california supreme court he no longer had the right to counsel and the fact of the matter is if he had filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that it would have effectively been asking at that stage for a type of error correction it scarcely seems logical that the scope of the remedy to which mr fry is entitled for the constitutional violation that he suffered that that should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable decisionmaking of the state appellate court in the 
 well if we are talking about what where is the logic in the result that i believe you are position produces which is that a prisoner who loses in the state court on harmlessness grounds because the state court finds its harmless obtains no habeas relief in federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him whereas if the state court never reached the harmlessness ground and erred on or ruled on whether the violation occurred whether there was any constitutional violation then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm now you know why would there what does he care whether whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation why should there be a different standard of review between the two 
 justice scalia thats the point raised in the solicitor generals amicus brief here and in mr frys case what happened was that there was a harmless error analysis conducted albeit truncated by the state appellate court but it was not a chapman analysis and that failure of the state appellate court to engage in a chapman analysis is contrary to this courts precedent it ignores chapman it also would be an attack on 
 lets assume another violation the court erroneously determines erroneously that there was no constitutional violation at all its error is not with regard to the harmlessness but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other regardless of whether the state court conducted chapman or not 
 i dont know that necessarily there has to be one standard of review for the other for one or the other your honor our position in this case is simply following the logic of this courts decision in mitchell versus esparza that this court or any federal habeas court needs to consider what the state appellate court did you cannot divorce there is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred in mr frys trial then that error is compounded when a state appellate court fails to assess the effect of that error under the chapman standard 
 you could say the same thing when the state court has erroneously determined that there was no violation in that case you apply the kotteakos standard i just dont understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error 
 well 
 i thought the state court didnt find that there was error i thought the state court said this was cumulative im not going to let it in 
 thats correct 
 it wasnt until we got into the federal court that there was an error found as far as the state was concerned there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review chapman or not because there was no error 
 thats correct thats in pages N to N of the joint appendix the state appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter of state law in this case the court also concluded that there was no constitutional error then in a footnote footnote N on page N of the joint appendix the state appellate court stated in the alternative effectively there was no prejudice that mr fry possibly could have suffered in this case however in making that alternative holding the state appellate court the california court was applying whats known as the watson standard which as this court has repeatedly recognized is the functional equivalent of the kotteakos type standard 
 and it is that determination that you are objecting to here the harmlessness determination 
 i am your honor obviously we are objecting to the state courts finding of no underlying substantive constitutional violation as well as the state courts determination that there was no 
 but for the former you are perfectly content with our applying kotteakos and for the latter however you say we have to apply chapman i just dont see the logic of that 
 well first of all this case since it has now been determined in the federal courts that there was an underlying constitutional violation does not present that question we do and i understand the position that you are raising justice scalia that there is a potential split in the logic there i dont think the court has to resolve that here some of the lower federal courts have determined that now in light of aedpa the brecht standard has been completely supplanted some courts have construed this courts decision in mitchell versus is esparza to lead to that conclusion and that may very well be the case however i dont think the court needs to ultimately address that proposition in this case 
 as i read the courts opinion in brecht the brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point rather than under direct review you would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesnt seem to take into account the fact that its collateral review rather than direct 
 certainly mr chief justice collateral review as this court pointed out in brecht can result in a more deferential standard of harmless error inquiry the those considerations that led this court in brecht to adopt kotteakos rather than chapman apply acrosstheboard in all habeas cases however a central theme of the brecht decision was that there have been chapman analysis conducted by the state appellate judiciary 
 well i guess thats where maybe we is the subject of debate whether the central theme in brecht was this is collateral review and that calls for a different standard or whether the central theme was chapman review had been undertaken and therefore that calls for a different standard im not sure i agree with you that the latter is the case 
 i agree that it could be it is a debatable point but the to ignore the circumstance that this court stressed i think undoubtedly stressed in brecht that there had been that state appellate review is to basically divorce the holding in brecht from the factual context in which that case or out of which that case arose 
 the dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence the dissenters in brecht they said that kotteakos would apply even where the state court has found that no violation has occurred 
 thats true justice scalia 
 in other words never approached the harmlessness thing thats what the dissenters thought 
 the dissenters thought that the import of brecht was that it was going to apply acrosstheboard in federal habeas 
 and i dont think the majority said the contrary i mean i wrote it i mean i dont know what counts is what i wrote not what i thought but if you read it i dont think it decides this question what i wonder though is why does the how does this case present the issue you want to argue im justice ginsburg made me wonder about that as i understand it the trial court said im not going to let this witness testify it is cumulative all right and then the appeals court said well that wasnt a mistake and one reason it wasnt a mistake is that this witness added nothing there could no possible prejudice says the trial court when he excluded that person that means it was cumulative that means it did nothing and that was the appeals court so the appeals court finds no error now we get over to the federal court and they say oh no this witness added a lot well they couldnt have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference very well we disagree send it back end of case now where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and i mean when i it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue because its so complicated how does this case raise it 
 well i suppose your honor because of the fact that the state appellate court didnt simply state we find no error and leave it at that but rather the state appellate court also raised the point that in a footnote in a truncated manner that there is no possible 
 was that as a reason for there not being error or was it in the context of saying well even if there was a mistake there was no possible prejudice what does the footnote mean in your opinion the second 
 yes 
 what is the footnote number 
 its footnote N 
 okay i will read it 
 page what 
 its N in the joint appendix your honor 
 thank you 
 thank you very helpful the other thing which i brought up so i might as well get both my questions out is that years ago i read a decision by judge leventhal that made a big impression on me and he was a very good judge its in a different context its the same problem he said i originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors a case where i could conscientiously say although i consider the findings clearly erroneous so id reverse if it were a judges decision nonetheless there is support and substantial evidence and therefore i affirm it because it comes from an agency but when i think about it i dont think theres substantial evidence either okay in other words has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself after reviewing the record oh i think that this is harmless so i will affirm but i dont think its harmless beyond a reasonable doubt so i will reverse i mean i find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind where i think such a thing is possible 
 i agree with you your honor its angels on the pin of a needle i guess is the phrase here and this case may be a case where the difference between chapman and brecht could be of consequence if youd look at the district courts treatment of this case at the district court level the court stated mr fry comes close to demonstrating actionable error and that court is applying the brecht standard the district court states i cannot rule out prejudice in this case so seemingly had that court applied chapman mr fry would have prevailed in the district court likewise in the ninth circuit we have the dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice even under the brecht standard and then we have the panel majority in ruling against mr fry on the prejudice issue stating that had pamela maples testimony been admitted that would have substantially bolstered mr frys claim of independence that statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is harmless error under brecht and even if its not inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying the chapman standard that court would have ruled in mr frys 
 if i could come back to may i ask this question is part of your argument that even under the brecht standard it was not harmless 
 yes your honor 
 this is a case am i correct where there were two two hung juries and then a fiveweek deliberation in this case and there was a harmless and the testimony of maples was she had seen a guy who didnt fit the description do the killing 
 correct your honor 
 where is that in the question presented 
 it says that if the brecht standard applies does the petitioner or the state bear the burden i guess thats the narrower question who has the burden 
 well the respondent has essentially conceded that under oneal that they bear the risk of nonpersuasion 
 but oneal i thought oneal just says that this word burden of proof is out of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading the record 
 i think that that was what the holding in the majority opinion was but i think as justice thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion the effect of that is to allocate the risk of nonpersuasion to the state and so i think that thats i could be wrong but it seems to me a semantic point and to justice stevens question as you pointed out in your concurrence in brecht the kotteakos standard which this court adopted in brecht is an exacting standard and in applying that standard if youd look at this case the courts decisions sullivan kotteakos say that the focus has to be on the jury here we have a jury in the third trial that deliberated for N court days after N court days 
 you are now arguing that under brecht this should not have been harmless is that the point you are making 
 yes your honor 
 okay now i didnt hear the answer to my question im not sure that is in the question that you presented and on which we granted cert it says which standard applies who bears the burden i dont see anything saying is this was it erroneous to conclude that this was harmless under brecht 
 well i believe number one does it matter which standard applies as part of the question presented does it matter which harmless error standard is implied my answer to that is no because mr fry prevails under either brecht or chapman and this court could in this case simply decide this case on that very narrow question like many court do where this issue is raised this intellectually challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply brecht or chapman when there has been no chapman analysis in the state court or when there has been an objectively unreasonable chapman analysis in the state court most courts confronted with that issue say we dont need to decide the question here because either the error was plainly harmless under both of those standards or plainly not harmless under both of these standards and i simply recounted the history of the litigation below in the federal courts to point out that this could be a case where that make a difference it seems like 
 the trouble with reading that second question that way is that you know it follows from your first question which speaks in the generality of cases its not speaking to this case your first question presented is if constitutional error in a state trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in federal court is the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set forth in chapman or in brecht thats the first question very generalized second question does it matter which harmlesserror standard is employed i didnt take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two i thought it meant you know is there any difference between the two standards dont you think thats fair reading of it 
 no your honor 
 you think it means does it matter in this case which harmless you think that second sentence means would would the defendant be entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which harmless error standard is employed you think thats what it means 
 i think that that is the import of that portion of the question 
 is that a question on which we would be likely to grant cert 
 perhaps not if that was the only question in and of itself but perhaps so because as i indicated before as justice stevens stressed in his concurring opinion in brecht the kotteakos standard is a demanding standard and look at this case if the error in this case can be deemed harmless under any standard then what cannot what is prejudice when you are looking at the jury and when you have a jury where nine days into the deliberations at least five of them voted that mr fry was not guilty they told the judge that they were at an impasse this jury struggled mightily with this evidence 
 would you help me with one thing im not terribly clear about though is it clear which what side the magistrate thought had the burden of persuasion 
 it is not and it seems as though looking at the language that the magistrate judge utilized in his findings and recommendations that he was looking to me to mr fry to meet that burden and i quoted his language in my brief and to the ninth circuit and i argued to the ninth circuit that the burden of persuasion had been improperly allocated to mr fry however that issue was simply not addressed in the ninth circuits opinion 
 does your opponent now concede that the state has the burden 
 yes respondent concedes that their burden that its their burden 
 how do they say that after i thought i wrote an opinion for the majority of the court which said this concept is not applicable in when you are reviewing a record for harmless error its not a question of presenting evidence what i think it said is that its not a question of presentation of evidence in such a case we think its conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly do i the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judges the jurys decision now maybe i was wrong but i think there was a majority of the court that agreed with it 
 yes your honor and i think your point as i understood it in oneal was that it analytically does not make sense 
 to talk about burdens of proof 
 when the appellate court is 
 yes but thats my basic question in this case and its a serious question suppose i think which i do think that i as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether i think this error of the judge was harmless and if i really try i can bring myself to understand this question regardless of what i think could another judge say a state judge reasonably have thought the opposite i can do that mentally you try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that i cannot do it i cant im sorry i admit it now if thats the state of mind that i can get myself into and i believe thats true of many judges how do i write words that are realistic in this area 
 i think that thats a question your honor that this court has struggled with as justice scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in dominguez benitez that we are talking about with these harmless error standards ineffable gradations of probability that are beyond even the judicial mind to grasp but i think if we just tie it to the facts of this case i think that in the explanation you just gave that there is no reasonable judge who could look at this case and conclude 
 there are many situations in which an appellate court has to apply a legal standard to facts in criminal cases and civil cases in a criminal case an issue on appeal could be whether theres sufficient evidence to support the verdict do you think theres a burden of persuasion on appeal on all of those issues 
 with respect to a standard sufficiency analysis no justice alito its just a question for the appellate judge to discern was there sufficient evidence in the record reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution 
 whats the difference between that and applying any harmless error standard its exactly the same kind of analysis its a different legal test but you are applying you are applying the law to facts 
 i agree and i dont quarrel at all with the way that the court described said that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless error inquiry in the oneal case that it doesnt fit to look at it in terms of the allocation of burden i dont think that this case ultimately turns on that except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted by the district court judge did state that he was looking to mr fry to make the sufficient showing 
 are you talking about whats on the bottom of page N of the joint appendix that was the only place that i found where the magistrate expressed a view on this it reads the court does not find that there has been the court does find that there has been an insufficient showing so that insufficient showing means showing by the petitioner is that what you are relying on 
 yes thats exactly what im relying on your honor so going back to specifically the facts of this case this court could as i indicated earlier without regard to the thorny chapman versus brecht question decide this case solely in terms of under brecht does mr fry prevail and we look at the nature of the constitutional violation that occurred 
 that wouldnt help us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which standard is applicable though right 
 no it certainly would not your honor and this court may very well deem that to be necessary but i think also that this court fashioning a decision which is faithful to the requirement that or the principle that kotteakos is an exacting standard would also be an important constitutional principle in a case like this where there has been no chapman review and where the chapman court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error standard in order to safeguard convictions safeguard against erroneous convictions where there is a close question of guilt or innocence that hasnt happened in this case and it would be appropriate for this court to fashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure that that happens 
 and that would put N out of sync with N where i understand if its a federal conviction then its always brecht on postconviction relief 
 as i understand that question the solicitor general pointed out in the introduction of its amicus brief that there are some N cases where theres been an intervening change in the law which could involve this question of brecht versus chapman and i have cited in my brief a district court case united states versus monsanto where the court concluded in accordance with the position that im advocating that it makes no sense for a reviewing court in a habeas proceeding to apply the brecht standard blindly without regard to what was done in prior proceedings but rather theres no need for deference where the the big issue in brecht as i understand it was this court was concerned about simply repeating a harmless error analysis that the state court had already done and we are not asking this court to do that in this case the same concern justice ginsburg holds over in certain limited N cases if i may save the balance of my time 
 thank you mr haltom mr moody 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court federal habeas is limited in scope and purpose it is not a continuation of the appellate process rather it is an extraordinary remedy limited by fundamental concepts of federalism comity and state sovereignty in brecht this court held that the stringent chapman standard was inappropriate for use on collateral review instead in order to strike a proper balance between state and federal interests the actual prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect on the verdict should be used in collateral cases petitioner is asking for an exception to this rule he claims that if he did not receive chapman review in state court he should receive it on federal habeas that was not the rule in brecht and it should not be adopted by this court here the brecht decision did not state an exception based on the state standard used the key in brecht was that appropriate balance between the federal government and the state this court has never treated cases where there was not a state chapman finding differently from other cases it applies brecht throughout in the penry case and in the oneal case there was no chapman finding in state court yet this court applied brecht and made no comment about that 
 you said in your brief that the remedy if the petitioner wants to assure hes going to get chapman review someplace then he should have sought cert direct review from the state courts conviction did you say that 
 yes your honor 
 but realistically the likelihood that such a petition would be successful passing the problem that the petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer does the likelihood that this court would grant cert on such a question is very slim 
 i agree the likelihood of the cert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not change the fact that once you come to court under N you are asking for collateral review and in collateral review its inappropriate to apply the chapman standard 
 i suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under N that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible 
 i i agree with that your honor 
 counsel if the state court had conducted a chapman review erroneously how would that be reviewed under federal habeas you would ask under aedpa whether it was an unreasonable application of chapman 
 yes your honor first you would ask if it was an unreasonable application of chapman if you found that it was not then the case is over theres no need to grant the writ if you found that it was you would proceed and do a brecht analysis and thats what we learned from 
 that seems awfully refined doesnt it to do two different analyses is this an is this an unreasonable application of chapman and then apply the brecht standard after determining that it was an unreasonable application of chapman 
 i dont disagree im merely trying to make sense of the various decisions in this in this arena theres some tension between the esparza decision and other decisions of the court and one has to find a place for aedpa standard so we would not object to simply an application of brecht which is what this court has always done but as far as it seems to suggest there may be an interim step 
 suppose we apply brecht this is what im having to little trouble with but id appreciate your commenting or straightening this out the ninth circuit holds two things according to the sg in the briefs he states them very well the first is lets look at this witness the testimony was excluded now the ninth circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence so thats their finding on the merits then they go on to say but the exclusion was harmless how could both those things be true how could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence thats one thing they say but the exclusion was harmless i just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things but maybe in the context of the case it was possible but thats what id appreciate your explaining 
 i think that the explanation is as follows when you are analyzing the denial of a defense type of evidence a chambers claim you first look to see how it fit into the defense and that is what they were doing you are not looking at the entire case you are looking only at the defense and so in the sense that something is better than nothing adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven may improve the defense case and yet nonetheless when you move to the next question which is was there a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict in the case and now you are not just looking at the defense you are looking at everything that was available to the jury it may be that there was still so much other evidence that it could overcome whatever increase you received on the defense 
 why is it necessary for us to try to reconcile those two statements the ninth circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there was a violation at all but we have to assume that for purposes of the question thats presented to us so why shouldnt we just analyze the harmless error question independently of what they said about whether there was a chambers violation 
 we would not object to that im trying to im trying to assist justice breyer in that perceived imbalance between a finding of a substance above and then a finding of harmless error before 
 well every time evidence is excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative or is the equivalent of a N balancing in federal court theres not a constitutional error under chambers and related cases is there 
 yes we agree thats certainly the law of this court and in this in well let me move on id like to make a couple of other points 
 may i go just back to justice breyers question for a second 
 sure 
 and i mean i think your answer to justice breyer was a very good answer as a as sort of a general statement but in would you agree that in this case if we if we do proceed number one to agree with you that brecht is the standard and we then do proceed to apply brecht here or to determine whether brecht was properly applied here that in this particular case the the record indicates that the case was so close that there would have to be a finding of harmful error or at least it would be impossible to find harmless error even applying brecht clear and you know what im getting at i mean five weeks of deliberation the question after whatever it was two weeks and four ballots and so on obviously this this case was just to tottering on the edge so even if we if we do get to the point of applying brecht wouldnt it be impossible to say that hes he gets no relief under brecht 
 no i would disagree with that you have the sixth court to hear this case the prior five have all rejected his claim and while 
 but two or three of those did it on an improper ground that you agree with now dont you 
 no i dont agree with that 
 for purposes of argument 
 for purposes of argument i do the district court and the ninth circuit both applied brecht and found that this was not an error which 
 it was two to one in the ninth circuit 
 this is true 
 judge rawlinson i think said that using the brecht standard that there was actual prejudice 
 yes she did there was a dissent in the ninth circuit 
 isnt this the i may have it wrong but isnt this the case in which the witness was unique not cumulative because she was the only one who was completely disinterested 
 no i would disagree with that shes been characterized that way but and i want to point out that i would like to clarify the record in response to your question justice stevens you asked whether or not she saw another man commit the murder and counsel appeared to agree with you that was not her testimony her testimony was that she overheard someone else confessing to murders that may or may not have been these murders and the and this was a very long case this case lasted eleven weeks it involved a hundred witnesses you can look at the opinions it produced in state court and in the district court they are each N pages long its not unreasonable to expect the jury to take a long time to decide that case now there are N court days of deliberations 
 five five weeks 
 five weeks N court days N of which were taken up with read back several several holidays i mean if you want to go through and look at it now 
 do you know of any other case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks 
 i havent attempted to find one it is a long deliberation 
 im sure theres an example somewhere but i i practiced law for over N years and i never heard of it 
 at what point how many weeks had gone by when they said they were hung 
 i believe that was i keep i have been switching back and forth between calendar days and court days so forgive me i believe that was on the eighth court day and at that point when they announced they were hung they selected a new foreperson and then rolled up their sleeves and went back in and deliberated the case 
 so 
 and after 
 go ahead 
 after they selected the new foreperson they asked for N read backs including the crucial evidence in the case the ballistics experts they asked for that they asked for the testimony of the incustody witness who heard the confession of mr fry they asked for mr frys testimony 
 did they ask for a read back of mrs maples testimony 
 well mrs maples testimony was not admitted it was excluded 
 oh thats right of course 
 but they did not significantly they did not ask for read back of the witnesses who testified similarly to to ms maples the third party culpability case was basically not credited by the jury they did not a read back of those witnesses 
 well maybe maybe youd end up 
 well maybe a critical witness was left out that argues the other way i think 
 i would encourage the court to carefully look at what ms maples was going to say if you look in her own words and im quoting i was just in and out of the room i just listened to bits and pieces of it and thats at joint appendix N this this witness may have been mr hurtzs cousin and not his exgirlfriend or his exgirlfriends mother but she did not have very much to say about this she said she didnt hear the beginning of the statement she could not tell you whether it was a serious discussion she was in and out of the room she heard only bits and pieces 
 but what she heard was that they were going to kill this other person was going to kill a man and a woman and it turned out that that was the crime at issue 
 with respect thats not what she heard 
 what did she hear 
 what she heard was a statement that he had killed a man and a woman and this was not immediately after the offense this is N months after the offense this is not next day 
 do you think do you think do you think i should do this im still looking im worried about on the one hand as you are having this court announce too many sixpart tests and having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a mistake for a judge and then you never finish a proceeding im worried about that as are you 
 yes 
 at the same time i think what counts is what the judge does the reviewing judge not what quite what the test says so there has to be a conscientious effort to decide was there was it harmless could a reasonable jurist in california have concluded the opposite okay so maybe we should do it in this case we simply try ourselves to go through this record make that determination to show by example rather than by trying to find a form of words 
 well you dont do it very often i understand that thats something you could do if you wanted to i think that this is just a classic case where two courts applied the brecht standard and reached their conclusions and theres nothing really remarkable about it 
 the third party perpetrator that maples was going to talk about according to the prosecutions theory was hurtz or hearst 
 hurtz yes 
 and there there was a link between hurtz there was an acquaintanceship between hurtz and the victim 
 thats right 
 was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through maples 
 actually im thinking about my answer because i was thinking about borelli there were three third party culpability potential targets in this case and i believe that hurtz the testimony of several of the witness who were admitted did testify of a link between cindy bell and hurtz 
 otherwise i mean they couldnt have found it was cumulative if if that had not been the case 
 in order to i need to correct the record on that as well the trial judge did not find that this was cumulative he found a lack of foundation what happened was was ms maples was offered as a witness 
 but on appellate review in california they found it cumulative didnt they 
 the alternative prejudice holding the footnote N they said it would have been cumulative 
 right okay 
 yes 
 and they they couldnt have found that if there hadnt been some evidence on hurtz apart from maples 
 oh thats right yes there was and thats really my point my point is that N third party culpability witnesses were allowed to testify in this trial and one was excluded 
 how did hurtzs name enter into the trial 
 well 
 why did anybody mention him 
 well for one thing he was called to testify and asked if he killed these people mr hurtz testified at this trial the jury got to see him they got to look him in the eye they got to hear him on direct they got to hear him on cross and they did not ask for a read back of that testimony 
 and if maples testimony had come in i presume they could have crossexamined him on the basis of maples testimony 
 well he stated he never said he killed these people and he he stated hed never said he killed a man and a woman in a car so it it went to what maples would have said and also 
 did he say hed killed peoples otherwise or at other times 
 he also denied doing that 
 well but then at that point in time maples maples conviction maples testimony becomes assuming theres a foundation becomes more relevant 
 i would disagree simply because she says she didnt hear the conversation well enough to really give her testimony any true probative value in the case because she was in and out of the room she didnt hear the beginning she didnt hear the end and when shes asked was it a serious discussion she says i dont know so this could be this could be something very different 
 thats classic going to the weight of the evidence that goes to the weight not the admissibility 
 ordinarily i would agree with that and if we knew your honor that he was speaking about these killings then certainly it would go to the weight but since he was speaking about killings that she said she didnt know if they were in california new jersey she didnt know when they occurred and therefore in california we ask that before you present third party culpability evidence you tie it to this crime 
 so we dont assume that hes committed a whole lot of killings i dont suppose 
 well its he may have committed other killings but if did not confess to committing these killings then theres no probative value to her testimony 
 do you think the question of the application of brecht is included within the questions presented 
 no i briefed it because i was concerned that the court might reach it but i dont think it is fairly presented the only other point that i wanted to make is that if one accepts petitioners rule it will basically swallow up the brecht standard and return to a near wholesale application of chapman on collateral review as tyson and trigg pointed out many many times petitioners come to court and they have a case where there was no finding of constitutional error in state court and therefore no chapman application but they are going to assert that in federal court and so if in every one of those cases you apply chapman then you really have reduced application of brecht 
 but on the other side state courts say we dont have we dont have to bother in any case with chapman because when it goes over into the federal court they are going to apply brecht 
 i dont think we should assume that the state courts are going to do that i think that what its sort of like what we said earlier in the argument your honor where not every evidentiary ruling is a constitutional violation i would say most of them are not and this court has not drawn a bright line of exactly where that is so in many cases this is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best and so therefore the state court would not be going to a chapman standard because it would not be finding error and with that im prepared to submit 
 thank you counsel ms millett 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the distinction between collateral review and direct review is deeply rooted in the law and what petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review for harmlessness in collateral review become the same standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct review got chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it that is the exact same argument mr brecht made in this court he got chapman review they cited chapman they didnt cite it here thats the only difference mr brecht came to this court and said they unreasonably applied chapman review and i should get it again on habeas and this court said that there is a deep difference a deep distinction between collateral review and direct review and that distinction turns upon the fundamental rule of habeas corpus and that is not to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a long record where difficult calls were made it is to correct fundamental miscarriages of justice grievous wrongs that have caused custody in violation of constitutional 
 may i ask two questions and then you can proceed one do you take a position on who has the burden of persuasion thats the first question and do you have an opinion on proper application of brecht in this case 
 if i can adopt justice breyers language from oneal and say that this court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of burden of persuasion we accept oneals holding what then there is equipoise which did not what happened in this case the tie goes to 
 but you do agree if it were in equipoise the state would have the burden 
 the tie would go to the prisoner yes were it in equipoise because the state would have the burden the state would lose i dont think thats what happened in this case i think what justice breyer what this court said oneal said is the way you articulated it instead of burden of proof is that its a level of conviction on the part of the court and what the judge will say in what the court said in oneal is do i think the error substantially contributed to the jurys verdict and that is essentially what the court said here on N at the very bottom when it said the court doesnt find that theres an insufficient showing thats the same way of saying i havent been persuaded that the error contributed to the verdict so i dont think that this case in any sense could turn upon whether we call it the burden of persuasion or the proper level of conviction on the part of the court this court was not persuaded and that is all that matters when the court is not persuaded and not left in equipoise the prisoner loses the second question you asked was whether we have a position on application of brecht and we do we have laid it out in our brief we think that in no sense does this record support the notion support the argument that there was a substantial and injurious effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was excluded talking about third party culpability and that requires not just looking at what in isolation what evidence was in there about mr hurtz there was i think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him either say he did it or he was there or he was involved but it requires looking at the whole record and there were the defense here was not a hurtz versus fry this was a case where the defense did an excellent job it was a well defended case and threw up a buffet of options for the jury none of which it bought on in the third trial you had what you didnt had in the prior trials you had ballistics evidence that linked his gun to the crime you have his own admission his own testimony that he left the house that night with the gun with the bullets and went out in the truck that was seen at a truck of the same type that was seen at the crime scene 
 i have the same problem justice souter does in all candor the jury takes five weeks to decide the case and theres a fairly interesting bit of testimony that doesnt get in and to say to be totally satisfied it didnt have an injurious effect on the deliberations is a close question i think 
 well two answers if its a close question if aedpa and if kotteakos and brecht mean anything its that the close calls go to the state and are not overturned by the sixth court on review 
 no but an equally divided call goes the other way 
 im sorry 
 if its not just a close call but if its equal it goes the other way 
 it is and no one has thought this was equal the two courts the three courts the california court of appeals also said in any event theres no possible prejudice now how they could say no possible prejudice under a state standard and still say ah but it would have affected the verdict under chapman is not something im able to understand so i think you have 
 neither am i but i draw a different conclusion from it from the one you are drawing 
 i guess i misunderstand your point because i think when the court said theres no possible prejudice 
 i mean i cannot accept the state the conclusion that there was no possible prejudice on the premises that justice stevens a moment ago and i a moment before sort of put out i just do not find that a reasonable conclusion 
 well again even if the court thinks there may have been some chance may have been you know relevant testimony this court can well disagree and can conclude that this was abuse of discretion if it were federal rule of evidence N you could decide this was a an abuse of discretion whether it was unconstitutional so clearly unconstitutional as to merit under aedpa and under brecht reversal of the conviction N years after the fact 
 i thought the aedpa question was out of it because that hasnt been there was no crossappeal on that question i thought it was a given a given in this case that the california courts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly established federal law i didnt think that was an issue in the case i think we took it on the assumption that it was such an error 
 again the respondents in this case have not conceded constitutional error and in their brief they repeat that and i think theres a question whether a court should 
 its not raised here there was no crossappeal from that 
 well a respondent is entitled to defend on any ground supported by the record but even assuming that we will assume the error assumes that there was an error and one assumes that it was which is hard for me to get to but one assumes it was clearly unconstitutional in this close call the type of call thats made hundreds of times in every trial balancing this and the combination of lack of foundation and cumulativeness its hard for me to understand when that rises to the level of unconstitutionality but if we assume that it did you have the two courts that applied the brecht standard here and the district court decision here is nearly N pages long its a very careful methodical analysis 
 thats because there were many many issues raised 
 theres many issues but also it was being careful and it was being very methodical and it went through this and it went through this record that court went through true this record more than N transcript pages N week of trial more than N witnesses and it was on that 
 i suppose if we are going to apply the brecht standard ourselves we would have to do the same thing 
 i think thats what this court has said the other thing i want to get back to is the question about the length of jury deliberations sure this was really wrong now they changed forepersons in midstream and got a reasonable doubt instruction repeated who knows what happened but what i will not concede i will concede its long but i will not concede that the mere fact of length of deliberations says anything about if this one particular error in applying a balancing test substantially affected the verdict i think the length of deliberations is so incredibly speculative 
 you will concede it was a close case wont you 
 i will concede it was i will concede it was a difficult case 
 if you take five weeks its pretty clearly a close case 
 thats right but you know the whole the point of federal habeas corpus is that this is not filling in the gaps in direct review we are not going to give you 
 theres no evidence or inference that it was close on the alternative murderer theory which is the only thing that maples testimony goes to 
 thats exactly right in fact if you look at the closing arguments mr hurtz has a couple of references in a twoday closing argument that was not the centerpiece of his case 
 it has to be close on an alternative murderer it wasnt suicide obviously if he didnt do it somebody else did so if its a close case from the first its obviously a close case for the second 
 no but as to who did it and whether hurtz did it or whether remember what the defense is trying to show is not who did it its that this person didnt do it and whether it was them or someone else is what we dont know again this is federal habeas corpus before this court and i dont think that the misapplication of a valid rule of evidence which is not what this court has in chambers holmes or any of the cases that were involved was so that simply disallowed the twelfth out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so clearly erroneous it was so clearly impacting the verdict in this case as to warrant a retrial N years after the crime and yes the jury it was close in the sense that they worked a long hard time but at the end of the day they were unanimous theres nothing close about unanimous and i think it would be the wrong message to say that a jury that works as hard as this one did did the readbacks culled through this record 
 yes but we dont know what they would have done if they had this evidence that was excluded thats the problem 
 one never knows that in habeas corpus but what you do when you look at what they were focusing on they were focusing on the two ballistics experts they had them read back right next each other they made that call its their job to do it 
 but the reason they may have been doing that is that they may very well have thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to know was whether the evidence going specifically to this defendant was strong enough to overcome it 
 may i answer one would have expected at least one readback on third party culpability instead of three readbacks of mr frys testimony which put himself that night with the gun in the truck and which he said you know and beforehand he agreed he might have said he wanted to blow them away thank you 
 thank you counsel mr haltom you have three minutes remaining 
 thank you the trial counsel 
 mr haltom before you go drifting counsel into the evidentiary questions in the case i have one question two cases a hurtz did not testify at all b he did is the foundation ruling any different in the two cases insofar as maples testimony or is it the same ie is there a lesser showing for foundation if hurtz did testify 
 i think that possibly the foundation with hurtz there could be increased the jury sought mr hurtz 
 oh you mean oh you mean more you have to be more strict for foundation after hurtz testified i was suggesting the opposite 
 well i was just thinking that his presence there would be relevant the jury actually saw him they heard a truck driver describing a neutral truck driver describing the actual killer who in no way fit the description of mr fry unfortunately the record doesnt indicate what mr hurtz looked like but the jury saw it and if the jury saw that that truck driver was describing a man that looked like mr hurtz then that 
 but there were all kinds of infirmities in that truck drivers testimony including the time the timing of the murder 
 there were infirmities in his testimony your honor however he came from missouri so maybe he was looking at a missouri clock we dont know but why would that man make up a story he has no axe to grind in this case and then his testimony is corroborated by a gentleman who sees him immediately after it and says he looked like he had just seen a ghost and described seeing a double executionstyle murder now 
 that was all presented to the jury right 
 that was all presented to the jury however ms maples testimony was not and counsel did not argue that heavily focused on mr hurtz guilt she certainly did argue it but the reason that she didnt is because as the court of appeals the california court of appeals said the other seven witnesses who said mr hurtz said he had killed the bells were all described as having been flimsy witness who gave contradictory unbelievable testimony 
 well how strong is this witness who didnt even know if it was a serious conversation didnt hear the beginning of it and didnt couldnt tell whether he was talking about something that happened N years before or N days before 
 mr chief justice she was extremely strong page jaN in the joint appendix respondent concedes she was the only unbiased witness concerning mr hurtzs concerning mr hurtz she heard this her cousin saying he shot a man and a woman in a parked car first shooting the woman in the head then shooting the man getting blood all over himself that linked up with all the other confessions in this case interlinking confessions just like in chambers were deemed to provide adequate assurance of reliability 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in case N bowles versus russell mr mancino 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court petitioner is before this court because he followed an order of the district court he filed his notice of appeal within the time authorized by the district court it was only when the matter came before the court of appeals was it raised that the district court apparently had no authority to grant a N day extension although it specified a specific date rather than the N days in connection with the case 
 yes it was authorized by the district court in the sense the district court put it on a piece of paper it wasnt authorized because the district court had no authority to extend that 
 the district court put it on there when you look at the actual entry itself its a handwritten entry theres no way of telling from the handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on the docket on the same date because all you have is the handwritten entry february N file your appeal by february N which is unusual in a civil case because normally in a civil case you get a judgment you dont get a directive from the court that you have N days to file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with this so i dont think its unreasonable to rely upon a directive from a court 
 but you knew that N days was the maximum because the motion asking for it cited and quoted from the rule 
 well that we did cite from the rule that is correct when the order came out well first of all we were glad to get the order to allow time to appeal but looking at the order or just looking at the date something had to be done and of course we filed on one day before the end date 
 what if what if the district court gave you an extra month would your argument still be the same that that because the court set it that trumps the limitation in the rule 
 well then you get into certain time limits whether its reasonable under the circumstances would a reasonable attorney or litigant rely upon a you know expansive period of time that the court gave to it but here certainly this order is not unreasonable its certainly within the confines and you have a specific end date do your notice of appeal by this date 
 but wouldnt a reasonable lawyer have said see i referred to the rule when i made this motion for extension of time the rule said N days this judge obviously made a slip he miscalculated wouldnt a lawyer faced with what the rule clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order say the judge probably made a mistake so i better if i want to protect my client do what the rule says 
 well looking back that is probably correct but looking at the order and the way it came out and the fact that you know the the rule allowed for a reopening of the appeal just looking at the end date of the order make sure the notice of appeal is filed by that date it would seem to me that the party who is adversely affected by it may object on that basis saying judge you have no authority to do this what are you doing in connection with 
 why isnt this is just a notice of appeal why would you why not file it the same day in terms of looking at it from some equitable sense i dont understand why you wait toward the end of the period assuming you hadnt focused on the difference between the N days and the days allowed what why why would you delay filing the notice of appeal 
 well the only reason for delaying it is obviously workload and you dont want to get all briefs due within a short period of time once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular case because you have time limits for getting the record your briefing and you know theres a number of appeals going out not in this court but you know there were a number of appeals going on and my normal practice is you know file your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable appeals time 
 does it make does it a difference that we are dealing with the safety valve provision in other words you have got the N days to file and then this rule allows you to its a safety valve if you didnt get the notice or whatever you have got a certain procedure that can give you the extra N days and now it seems to me that you are asking for a safety valve on top of a safety valve and i wonder if theres some point where you cut off the allowing an out for missing the deadline 
 well i suppose at some point someone may say well if the court gave you N days to do the act someone may say well that appears to be unreasonable in connection with that i think the safer thing is just to put the order down say application reopen the appeal time granted and then it would cause someone to go you know go back look at the rule see how much time is allotted under the rule in connection with the case but i dont think its unreasonable in these circumstances we are only talking about three days to do an act the act was done in two days 
 well but as soon as you start talking about an exception from the provision in the rules then you are going to get a lot of applications and there are going to be a lot of different reasons for why it wasnt filed on the last day once that it seems to me you open it up for an indeterminate ruling 
 well this is an equitable rule in itself because it allows something where an appeal time has expired can you come in and show the circumstances one you were not notified which obviously the court did the other sides prejudiced 
 well it is an equitable rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits 
 well thats thats once its granted its not the time limit is N days or the seven day after you received or became aware actual notice 
 no but justice kennedys point i think is critical in other words the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to provide a safety valve but they also appreciated that you cant have it openended so they did impose limits on the if you want to call it equitable exception to the N day rule and it seems to me that you sort of restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if you allow further equitable departures from their their rule 
 well i think in past cases the court has always recognized there are deadlines but there are exceptions to deadlines and the most compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at this particular time and you know its coming from a judicial officer its not coming from someone miscalculating on the calendar calculating the time when its N days run when is N days run when its N days run in connection with the case because in civil litigation you are not given any specific time to do an act criminal cases are a little bit different you are told about an appeal when an appeal has to be filed in connection with a case you do not have in civil when you get your final order you know you have N days to do it 
 mr mancino your position here is that this rule is not jurisdictional now what what are the consequences of that i take it that that would mean that the court of appeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether the matter has been filed too late 
 well i believe 
 right if the parties dont make anything of it the court of appeals can can take a late a late filing 
 well i think when the court of appeals does that i think in all fairness they should advise the parties in advance that they we are considering this on our own that the appeal was out of time and would you like to 
 no no but im asking whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that if the parties dont make anything of it the court of appeals can just assume its okay and go ahead right 
 correct because i think they have waived any the other side obviously has waived or forfeited any right to object to the you know to the 
 and you need an objection or else its it will be okay 
 im sorry 
 and you need an objection or else it will be all right 
 yes the objection in this case came you know in the 
 that means that a rule that N days is really a rule left to the discretion of the district judge if the district judge feels like giving a little more this would be no control unless the opposing side objects is that right 
 well i i believe it does call for a timely objection by somebody to say something rather than to just sit back and let it expire knowing that someone did something that they should not do in connection with 
 suppose you have problems at home i dont know you have an illness at home and you ask counsel for the other side you know i know its a N day limit but would you give me N days right and opposing counsel being as friendly as they are nowadays 
 the other the other side would say sure take N days okay so you prepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs off on it gives you N days thats okay then right 
 well i 
 because the other sides agreed he wont object on the court of appeals and suddenly suddenly you have got N days even though the rule says N 
 well there you have somewhat advance knowledge that you are doing something possibly contrary to a rule but then you have the issue of once you do it are you forfeiting your right to object and claim a deficiency in the process here you are only what you are doing 
 well i mean that that may that may be true of this stage but justice scalias question points up the problem of what do we do if we write this case how do we formulate this rule and if we say that its not jurisdictional not binding then going forward it seems to me to allow the hypothetical that he puts to you 
 well i believe you can come up with all sorts of scenarios what i think is the thing 
 thats why we are wondering how to write the opinion 
 and where did the litigant reasonably rely upon an order of the court which apparently the court had authority to issue regardless of the court making a mistake or doing something intentionally 
 and the person who did the reliance was you i guess 
 yes thats correct 
 and is it correct that who was this litigant represented by counsel during the period when he didnt get the notice of the september N order 
 yes i filed the habeas petition i did anything in connection with the case 
 so neither the neither the prisoner nor you received any notice of the first goof up 
 well the first well we received notice of the judgment on the merits then we filed a motion to alter judgment or for a new trial it was not the order overruling the motion to alter or amend judgment or the motion for a new trial date was not received and the clerks docket showed it wasnt mailed out 
 i see 
 but in the in that court there was a transitioning to this electronic filing which not everybody was set up at that particular time so apparently the order may have only gone to on the electronic filing system to those who were set up and we were not set up on that thing but the court still had the obligation to send it out the court found that the clerk did not send it out the clerk found that or the court found that we did not have notification and the court found that the other side is not prejudiced by any application 
 would your would your proposed exception does it work the other day i mean lets say the district court entered this order and set a date certain for you to file the notice of appeal and only gave you seven days on his count rather than N and you filed it on the ninth day in other words within the N days given under the rule would you be out of luck because of what the district court set out in its order as whats binding as opposed to what the resume says or could you rely on the fact the rule says you get N days 
 well i would believe you could then argue that the rule says that the judge was wrong in you know in truncating your appeal time to file the appeal 
 why wouldnt the same approach work the other way the rule says N and the judge was wrong to give you more 
 well because the exceptions to all of these time deadlines you have cases from this court where people untimely file a motion for a new trial a new trial motion by rule has to be timely filed in order to toll your time and there have been cases where the motion for new trial has been untimely filed the other side didnt say anything and then when the ruling is made the appeal is filed within the appropriate time and this court has sanctioned that procedure in connection i see no difference here where a litigant before a court the court issues an order you look at the order and you abide by the order in connection with the case they do have a reasonable reliance in the case and in looking back later on in connection with the the issue in connection with the case 
 you know sometimes sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case that they that they shouldnt have jurisdiction over 
 well 
 and sometimes in reliance on that you go through a whole trial and it comes up to the court of appeals and we say huh there was no jurisdiction here too bad 
 well 
 even though the court said it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the district judge district judges make mistakes 
 well thats a whole i believe thats a whole different scenario than presented here that goes to the subject matter 
 its even worse it seems to me i mean you have wasted weeks you know in trial and so forth 
 right 
 but if its jurisdictional we have to say you know too bad yes you were misled by the judge in reliance on the district judge you expended a lot of time and money but there was no jurisdiction and thats the end of the matter 
 well the rule i always remember from law school is that parties cannot voluntarily confer jurisdiction on a court that does not have it and the court at any point if they do not have subject matter jurisdiction is free to dismiss the case whether its at trial level the appeal level or whatever this is not that situation obviously the court by the rule could look into this matter the court by the rule could grant relief in connection with this matter its a question whether the three days 
 i know i could find this out by looking at a calendar do you remember what day of the week february N th was or N th 
 i believe 
 we dont have a weekend problem do we 
 i believe it was not i dont believe it was a weekend no 
 i looked at this theres a time start and i think it might be the time stamp when this document was entered on the ultimate appeal but but something you said at the outset prompts this question that did you think that the time runs from $N days after the date when the district courts order is entered 
 when its entered thats correct 
 and was there a submission or an implication in your remarks that you thought that the order was not entered until three days later 
 no 
 is there an entry is there a time entry on the dock on courts order 
 no its a handwritten one that doesnt say anything 
 i know that its a handwritten one but that that that shows how long he has to appeal is there a date when the order was put on the docket does that show on this sheet 
 no theres nothing from the clerk indicating on the docket there is but nothing on the document that was sent because the document only was sent it was just handwritten over the on top of the motion so there was no way of telling when it was entered because you look back at the history of this case when the court dismissed the original petition the court had a date on it it was only N days later that it was actually entered by the clerk and of course that triggered the time for asking for reconsideration so but 
 what about the weekends i mean maybe the judge i it looks from my calendar i wondered what day of the week it was you dont remember N or N february N N what day of the week was it 
 that i cannot answer 
 it looks like it was the middle of the week so maybe there were one or two weekends so maybe what the judges mistake was he didnt know how to count the weekend rule 
 well what i think was done 
 which may not be jurisdictional the weekend rule 
 what i believe is that this was sent out by mail so they had you know the threeday mail rule and thats how you came to the N days in connection with the put in the N day limit on 
 maybe arabic numerals arent jurisdictional either 
 they are not a numeral is not jurisdictional whats whats whats the threeday mail rule 
 well normally if you are allowed to do an act by mail you have three days you can serve a party and then you have three days to file with the court as part of the civil rules i sort of think thats what the judge because this was going out by mail he probably didnt get i wish i would have saved the envelope but i dont have the envelope but it probably didnt get to my office for three days anyway 
 speaking of the threeday mail rule maybe the judges intent when he signed this was that it actually was entered took effect as of three days later 
 well theres really no looking at the document theres no way of telling that that is correct theres no way of telling that and i believe that was probably the reasoning of the court that you know it took three days to get mail because you didnt get it wasnt sent out last time obviously you did not get the mail the last time so he added the three days and then you have the N days to you know perfect or file your notice of appeal to get it to the court in this case so 
 all of that might have all those things might have been going on in the judges mind but you dont contest that the N day period was not complied with you dont have an argument that you complied with the N day period 
 no i do not we are relying to the exceptions and theres a number exceptions on deadlines that have come out we have the equitable tolling we have the waiver forfeiture issue and you know in this case specific assurance by a court which in a past opinion seemed to control the date where a judge gave you a specific assurance that you could do something in connection with the case the old harris truck case is where the lawyer was on vacation the judge said well i will give you some extra time even though they knew of the judgment they knew the time would run he said i will give you extra time to file the appeal because you want to contact the lawyer who was on vacation the court of appeals then said well the rule didnt apply because you knew of the order so but that was overlooked even though by time calculation everybody was out of time the eberhart case they were out of time because the motion for new trial was filed untimely which under the rule required a timely filing of a motion for a new trial in order to toll your appeal time so this obviously the motion to reopen was timely filed was filed within the N days required by the rule the other side was served the other side had no objection to it and didnt oppose it the real issue when you look at an equitable sort of an equitable rule like this is the other side prejudiced and obviously they are not prejudiced 
 one of the things i think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that there would be a point at which the prevailing party in the district court could know with certainty there wasnt going to be further proceedings in the case and thats the purpose of the N day period and all that its not openended under your rule where the actual time for filing could be at some indefinite point theyd never really quite have that assurance would they 
 well unless the court specifically granted to the litigant a specific period of time and you know normally litigants and lawyers do not ignore what the court says at least i think as you know anyone if this court said that you have a right to reasonably rely on what the court said and it certainly wasnt an unreasonable period of time that the court was giving in the case it wasnt 
 well what would be an unreasonable period of time if the two or three days is not would another N days 
 well if you go back to the rules you are going into the six months N days and then you know you would say something or if the court you know gave you a year or something by mistake you know it would you know that something does not sound right here and then you would look at it at least if that were the case you could probably go in and get the court to reconsider bring it to the attention of the court your honor we did not have all of this time did you make a mistake you can always correct mistakes but that was not done here it was not done by the respondent in this case because they didnt the respondent did not object to the application to reopen the appeal did not say anything 
 but the respondent said he had no reason at that time to believe that you wouldnt follow the rule and file within the N days so if they made an objection the moment the judge put down a date thats N days later the judge might say thats premature 
 well then the judge may have said well i dont look at the rule i dont have it im going to redraft the order vacate my order and put a proper order on in connection with the case it would seem to me that at some point in the appellate process because when you look at the history that the sixth circuit in this case at least when the court then granted a certificate of appealability you would think the respondent would what are why are you granting a certificate of appealability when you told us we have no jurisdiction over this case or at least from the two orders anyway they said they had jurisdiction over the february N th order that on the appeal and the then the certificate of appealability was denied and normally that would end the case the court granted the my motion for reconsideration and then granted certain issues that could be briefed on the merits but once the court granted the certificate of appealability it seemed to me that the other side well what is happening here 
 mr mancino i take it that what you are really proposing is sort of a rule that if if counsel could reasonably be misled to overlook the mistake by the court that your reliance upon the courts mistake should should in fact be respected its kind of a rule of reasonably misleading is that about right 
 i believe so 
 i mean thats how we distinguish your case on your view from the case in which you get N days instead of N 
 right sort of you know reasonably reliant is it fair 
 you think we should have a rule of reason rather than a per se rule 
 thats the prior case because they made that 
 let me ask this question is the order on page N of the joint appendix just those three lines thats the entire order that the judge entered it just says granted and motion 
 that is whats handwritten on the original documents thats it 
 he did not make the findings that the rule requires 
 no but presumably you would assume that those findings are subsumed within the rule because the judge found in our favor the judge denied the motion to vacate part of it but granted the reopening to vacate and of course on the 
 because the motion requires 
 motion to vacate you have N days to appeal 
 the rule requires that he make three specific findings which he did not make 
 he did not make it but you assume that the judge did by granting the motion and nobody else said anything about it anyway i reserve the time 
 thank you counsel mr marshall 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the petitioners failure to meet the N day statutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is fatal to his case for three reasons first the N day period is mandatory and jurisdictional and federal district courts do not have the power to enlarge this time period second the N day rule was not forfeited by the state of ohio and may be raised by the court sua sponte in any event third even if there could be some sort of limited equitable exception to the N day time requirement the petitioner here falls far short of demonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary relief let me explain why the petitioners claim that notice of appeal time requirements are not jurisdictional contradicts N years of practice countless lower court decisions settled congressional understanding as to the meaning of its governing 
 what type of jurisdiction are you speaking of its certainly not federal jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter jurisdiction like a specific case arising under federal law what kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind 
 your honor i think it is its own form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way that final judgments on appeals are subject matter jurisdiction and the reason why is that notice of appeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense in that they transfer the locus of the case from one court to another in the appellate system theres actually a changing of the jurisdiction and the notice of appeal is that triggering mechanism and in that sense it is classically jurisdictional and different from the other kinds of time limits that this court addressed in kontrick in versus eberhart because those took place within a particular court system the district court system where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction triggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the other 
 isnt that just a word game its jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction from one court to the other why should that be why does that make it jurisdictional 
 well i think your honor the same way that final judgments are i mean final judgments are a jurisdictional prerequisite to transfer from one case to another the second reason your honor by the way is congressional is the congressional reenactment of the notice of appeal time deadlines which also indicates that congress treats these 
 can you think of anything thats enacted by congress as jurisdictional 
 no your honor but when there is a background as there is in this case of N years of practice where congress has enacted against that background it is presumed to be jurisdictional and id also point out that with respect to this courts jurisdiction the court has treated petitions for certiorari as jurisdictional in civil cases because there is a statutory underpinning but has not treated them as jurisdictional in criminal cases in part because there is not a statutory underpinning 
 doesnt the latter suggest that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional 
 your honor i think the latter recognizes the fact that it doesnt necessarily have to be that is correct however that congress and this court can treat such a thing because it is in a because it is a because it does transfer the case from one to another i think that the criminal that in the certiorari case with respect to criminal it might be an indication there that there might be some relation but i would also suggest that with respect to certiorari practice you have already you are already in the appellate mode and you are not dividing the jurisdiction between trial courts and appellate courts but the quick answer is yes your honor i dont think it has to be jurisdictional but certainly it can be jurisdictional and for N years this court and congress has treated this particular division as jurisdictional 
 well it seems to me thats what we are back to that its long been treated as jurisdictional but you just said that its not sufficient that its been enacted by congress and its not sufficient that it transfers the case from one court to another so we are back just to history right 
 well your honor its more than just history because i think congress reenacting N against this background for N years that this issue has been treated as jurisdictional puts congress behind this as well but here its also N years is not a matter of 
 the provision of is it N 
 yes your honor 
 where does that appear in the judicial code does it appear under the provisions concerning jurisdiction 
 no your honor N does not itself mention jurisdiction however that is also true with N in respect to this courts certiorari jurisdiction in civil cases the word jurisdiction is not mentioned specifically but it 
 but it is under the heading procedure court procedure right 
 its time for appeal to court to proceed 
 yes but thats under a chapter that deals with procedures as opposed to jurisdiction 
 yes your honor but this court in barnhart suggested that in determining whether something is jurisdictional or not one looks at the context of the particular location here this rule N excuse me here this statute N has been enacted and reenacted against the background of this court consistently saying its jurisdictional and treating this rule as jurisdictional and thats since cases as far along as edmondson 
 you know there have been a spate of cases that said the word jurisdiction has been vastly overused its a word of many meanings and you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is subject matter jurisdiction just like its diversity is there a federal question 
 yes your honor in the same way that amount in controversies are also subject matter 
 but amount in controversy is in N congress putting it right there together it says diversity of citizenship plus amount in controversy all in N here the limit appears in a statute a rule of procedure not jurisdiction 
 yes your honor but that statute has been enacted against as i keep reemphasizing N years of practice including the edmondson case in N where the court on its own motion raised the matter as being jurisdictional and because the time period had not been complied with dismissed the appeal the question essentially isnt whether we are going to call it jurisdictional or not the question is the effect of the particular rule some of the lower courts call its indications of jurisdiction or a prerequisite to jurisdiction the question is what the treatment of this particular requirement is and the treatment of this particular requirement consistently for over N years has been that it is mandatory jurisdictional nonforfeitable it can be raised by the court sua sponte 
 what characteristics are you asserting follow from calling it jurisdictional in this case 
 your honor the 
 number one it cant be waived right 
 thats correct 
 number two 
 its nonforfeitable 
 the court of appeals has to inquire on its own right 
 yes your honor 
 anything else 
 yes your honor theres no equitable exception to it there is no equitable exception to it as well if its jurisdictional so all of those three attach to the term jurisdictional but i also think they could equally attach to the notion that even if we dont want to call it jurisdictional if we dont view it as fitting easily within this category of subject matter jurisdiction 
 except at least as to the second at least as to the second i dont know of any matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which is not jurisdictional thats the one of the three characteristics that i think we have always attached the word jurisdictional to i think 
 well your honor in day versus mcdonough in dealing with a habeas with a habeas statute of limitations this court approved the court of appeals raising that issue sua sponte although they although in that case the court 
 it may 
 it may 
 but not must 
 yes your honor 
 not must and truly with things we have called jurisdictional you must right 
 yes your honor however if the lower courts wanted to play with the language a little bit and call it necessary for the invocation of jurisdiction or a prerequisite 
 we could call it quasijurisdictional you wouldnt object to that 
 no your honor as shakespeare might say its not the name we are interested in the effect and the effect here has been traditionally enforced over N years of court practice 
 well what do you think is the 
 how far do you take it suppose this ^ slip is not noticed in the court of appeals and then theres a petition for cert and some clever law clerk notices that the notice of appeal was filed in N days instead of in N days would the court then have to dismiss for want of jurisdiction 
 yes your honor i think it applies in the same way that lack of diversity would apply or lack of a federal question could apply as in the mottley case even if it was in front of this court if it was recognized in front of this court at that time it would it must be dismissed 
 lets take it a step further lets assume it isnt recognized assume he gets his habeas relief and three years later some eager beaver is culling through the records and says this guy never should have been in court do they rearrest him and put him into prison 
 your honor collateral attacks for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not normally sustained if thats what the if i understand your question correctly so that for example in a diversity case if two years or three years after it proceeds to final judgment somebody realizes that both parties were from the same state the collateral attack would normally not allow to change that to change that result and i would think that the same thing would happen here if the case had proceeded to final judgment if there were an error of this type as with other types of errors in subject matter jurisdiction there would not be an opening for collateral attack 
 what about something here i hadnt run across called the unique circumstances doctrine this court in osterneck said this where a party has performed a act which if properly done would postpone the deadline for filing his appeal and indeed thats what happened here he postponed the deadline for filing his appeal and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done and here he did receive specific assurance by a judicial officer that the act was properly done in those circumstances you can make a little exception in the interests of justice 
 well your honor the unique circumstances doctrine doesnt apply here because there wasnt an act which if requested could have been properly done 
 yes yes the act was that he filed a motion to reopen which motion to reopen postponed the time of appeal and two things have to happen with that act one is you have to get the district judge to agree and second you have to file the paper so thats the act which if properly done would in fact have led to the appeal 
 your honor i think that 
 i agree there were two parts to it or two acts if you want 
 but justice breyer in this case i think that what would have had to happen is that the petitioner would have had to move for N days in order for the act to be properly done he moved for N days 
 i thought what we were talking about was that if the order had said N days instead of N then the act would have been properly done that is the only reason that the N days according to mr mancino the only reason he took N days was the judge authorized that if the judge hadnt authorized that the rule wouldnt have been discarded and he would have filed in N days 
 well your honor the judge our argument is in part that the judge had no power to authorize it if i understand your question with respect to the unique circumstances doctrine this doesnt fit in because in the unique circumstances doctrine the litigant actually has to seek a particular type of relief and get granted that relief the petitioner here did not seek leave to file his motion of appeal within N days the petitioner here sought which is the only thing he could do under the rules is seek to reopen for N days 
 so he hasnt received just quoting from osterneck he hasnt received assurance that the act has been properly done 
 thats right 
 in other words if he came back and said was my notice of appeal timely or something and the judge at that point ruled then it might come under that provision but this is just prospectively he could have filed this timely even after the judge issued the order in other words he could have filed it on the N th day he didnt have to wait until the N th day 
 thats correct your honor 
 why does that matter i mean also osterneck i happened to guess involved a case that took place on tuesday this case took place on thursday i mean i grant you the language literally you could say doesnt quite fit it but so what the purpose of this osterneck i take it is to have a very narrow exception where a judge tells you basically what to do and you follow what the judge said and then lo and behold they hit you with this jurisdictional thing and you didnt get it right now that seems to be its purpose and the language is very close so why not follow it 
 your honor the purpose of the unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a license to litigants to rely on district court errors 
 that would be the very narrow circumstances doctrine not the unique circumstances doctrine 
 i notice the court applied it twice so it couldnt quite be the unique circumstances 
 thats right your honor 
 may i ask this question supposing there was a dispute as to whether the order had been entered on february N or february N say his handwriting was illegible would that be a dispute that would remain open throughout the appellate process 
 your honor the question is when the clerk of court would have entered for the entry of judgment 
 if hed entered this order on february N or N i forget which day it was the appeal would have been timely 
 thats correct your honor 
 and im just and the order was defective because it didnt make findings required by the rule and im just wondering supposing it was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered would the party then be entitled to rely on the date february N th set in the order or would he have a duty to investigate and find out exactly when the judge signed the order 
 i think the key question your honor i think is when the when the order is entered into the docket which is done by the clerk of course i think that is the triggering time 
 my question is what if thats somewhat ambiguous a busy court he handed it to the clerk and the clerk didnt enter it into the docket you are not sure theres a fact dispute about that 
 your honor thats a different case the beginning time period is a beginning case if there was some ambiguity there 
 i understand im just wondering what your view is how should courts resolve that kind of dispute should that be a dispute that remains open throughout the appellate process or theres a factual dispute as to when the judge signed order 
 yes your honor again the factual dispute is when the 
 if he had written here instead of N he had written down N then the prosecutor N days later realized he had written down the wrong date would that have made the appeal untimely 
 your honor i think the question at that point is what is the time period entered into the formal docket and what is the actual judgment 
 and thats ambiguous im saying thats ambiguous 
 if for some reason the court records are jumbled for some reason or another and nobody can determine when that entry of order is thats a different case 
 in that case you then rely on the february N date in the order then it must be permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by N in such a case it would be okay 
 again your honor the critical thing with the rule period is the time period from the entry of judgment 
 i know and i say its hard to figure out when the order was actually written down in the docket 
 i think that the question that would be required then was for whoever was filing the notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the docket is if thats ambiguous i think its obligatory on the litigant to err on the side of caution your honor 
 and not rely on the N date 
 i would certainly suggest that a litigant argue on err on the side of caution if at all 
 justice breyer quoted from the osterneck case there was another statement of the rule which goes like this there is a sharply honed exception covering cases in which the trial judge has misled a party who could have and probably would have taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct rather than incorrect information this case fits right into that description doesnt it 
 no your honor the case that they are citing to is thompson and in thompson what occurred in that case is that the litigant in that case 
 the case that im reading from is the concurring opinion in carlisle against united states it does cite thompson 
 thompson is the case thompson this court has not relied on the unique circumstances doctrine in N years buy in thompson what occurred was the petitioner requested a new trial untimely but was told by the court that they had timely requested a new trial because they were informed that they were entitled to a new trial they did not do something else which was file the notice of appeal so the court basically sent them down the wrong avenue here there was no wrong avenue that the court that the litigant was being sent down 
 but they would have filed that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said your motion for a new trial is untimely it seems to me the same as in this case the judge said your motion is timely so you are going to have the trigger so much later fine if the judge had said your motion is untimely and you know you have got to get your notice of appeal in sooner rather than later similarly here the judge said well you have got until N days later if the judge had done right and said the N day period then surely mr mancino would have filed within that period 
 but your honor there is nothing that the court did that prevented the litigant here from filing on time there was nothing that would have prevented the litigation here from filing within the N day period and when 
 there was nothing in thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal 
 except in thompson your honor he was told that he had the right to proceed on a motion for new trial if he had your honor i see that my time is up 
 you can finish your answer 
 in thompson your honor the difference is that that the litigant was sent down a different road which was inconsistent with his filing a notice of appeal here there is nothing inconsistent about filing a notice within N days as opposed to N days 
 thank you mr marshall 
 thank you your honor 
 we will hear from mr stewart 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court for four basic reasons the deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable first the time limit sent forth in section N directly implicates the concerns that underlie the special treatment of jurisdictional issues its a fundamental precept of our legal system that federal courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating cases where congress has not authorized them to do so or to put it another way our legal system has presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the misapplication of law in cases that a court is authorized to adjudicate 
 mr stewart do you think this is subject that question is subject matter jurisdiction 
 we would we would characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction that is this court has often said that its the fundamental duty of this court when doubt is when doubt is apparent to inquire into its own jurisdiction and that of the court from which the record comes and that division presupposes that there are cases over which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction over which this court would not have appellate jurisdiction for example situations sometimes arise particularly in cases that are adjudicated by threejudge district courts in which there is a dispute as to whether a particular district court order is directly appealable to this court or should go instead to the court of appeals and if somebody comes to this court and this court determines that the appeal should have gone to the court of appeals instead the error is characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction this court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even though theres nothing to suggest that the case as a whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court 
 mr stewart thats one those interesting examples we lack jurisdiction of the case but we have power to order it refiled to vacate the order and have it refiled dont we 
 that is an anomaly the court has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the case except to vacate the order and i think thats a court that im not going to try to explain 
 but i think mr marshall has identified the second example namely the final decision requirement of N usc N that is thats universally conceded to be a jurisdictional rule even though it has nothing to do with whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case it is simply whether this particular decision over for which review is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals and our point 
 mr stewart should we repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine 
 i dont think you need to i think you should repudiate any conception that federal courts have freewheeling authority to excuse noncompliance with statutory time limits for taking appeals 
 well the unique circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which courts say yeah you can excuse it 
 well i i think actually both harris and thompson are explicable on other grounds and may even be correct in more limited ways for example harris 
 but on the grounds for which they have been taken as authority is it your view that we should repudiate those grounds 
 yes with respect to civil cases for which the time for taking an appeal is specified by statute its our view to the extent that harris and thompson would otherwise support the proposition that district courts may excuse noncompliance with the time limits those cases should be repudiated 
 well in criminal 
 in criminal cases the time for taking an appeal is not specified by statute its imposed by federal rule of appellate procedure N but theres no statutory basis for it there was up until N a provision of title N of the us code section N that specifically authorized this court to promulgate rules that would establish the time for filing a notice of appeal 
 but in though of course youd have to confine it very narrowly i take that doctrine if there werent a statute you read it into the rule so there is a statute and you read the statute as saying well there could be very some very narrow circumstances that congress would have been willing to make an exception for example it is a couple of days and the judge tells you do it or lets you do it its roughly the same thing isnt it 
 well i think it makes a fundamental difference that there is a statute in place and certainly with respect to circuit certiorari petitions coming from the court of appeals to this court this court has recognized that distinction to be fundamental 
 you are sure habeas cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather than criminal 
 yes theres no no dispute about that and indeed if the if this case were classified as civil for purposes of i mean as criminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an appeal it would have been far out of time under federal rule of appellate procedure N indeed the authority of the district court to have granted the reopening period N days later wouldnt have been present in the criminal context 
 looking at the rule it does require these findings has that been interpreted to require that they be written on the record or is that simply something thats supposed to guide the district court 
 i think the courts of appeals have not required that they be written on the record but have required that there be a basis appearing in the record for those findings so for instance if petitioners counsel had filed a document asking to reopen in the time but had not represented that he had not been informed of the judgment then i think that if the court had granted the reopening that could be set aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support in the record for such a finding but i dont believe the courts of appeals have required there be explicit findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the grant of the reopening the point i was going to make about the certiorari petitions is that this courts rule N imposes a N day limit for filing a cert petition in all cases it is not divided between civil and criminal but this court has recognized that the N day limit has a very different status is criminal cases than in civil cases that is rule N of the rules of this court states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out of time the clerk is directed not to file it and rule N cites usc N so the clear implication is that the court recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil cases to be a jurisdictional limit and the crucial point of rule N is not simply that it uses the word jurisdictionally its that it gives an instruction to the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether any other party objects its the very type of thing that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction as to matters over which it has an obligation to take cognizance regardless of the other partys objection in criminal cases by contrast the N day rule applies under the rules but the court has recognized that it retains the authority to grant petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where the other party objects the other thing i would say about N and its part of it is reprinted at page N of the governments brief in the last full paragraph of page N it says the basic time limit for appeals in similar cases is set by N usc N which states that and then the part we havent reproduced says except as otherwise provided in this section and then it goes on to say no appeal shall bring any judgment order or decree in an action suit or proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal is filed within N days and the significance of this provision this language is it doesnt simply say a notice of appeal must be filed within N days language like that would conceivably leave open the question of what happens if the notice of appeal is untimely filed this language actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within N days the appeal will not bring the judgment 
 but it begins with the exception as provided in subparagraph 
 thats correct so we are not saying that the N day limit is absolute 
 yeah 
 but we are saying that the rule specifies that if the various time restrictions are not complied with the appeal will not bring im sorry the appeal shall not bring the judgment order or decree before the court of appeals this is specifically framed as a limitation on the authority of the reviewing court 
 what do you think if we did go to thompson and looked at that this would be a fortiori from thompson as described in osterneck was a case in which the judge simply said from the bench look your your the new trial motion is timely though it wasnt it was out of by two days while here we have a formal court order it is a formal order entered with a you know stamp of the judge and it says you have till the N th to file 
 well are two things we would say about thompson the first is that as this court explained in its recent decision in hibbs versus winn its long been recognized that a timely motion for reconsideration will suspend the finality of the judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal and the court in hibbs versus winn further explained that under certain circumstances even an untimely motion for reconsideration will have that effect if the judge appropriately considers it on the merits and thompson can be explained as holding simply that where the government does not object and the district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as timely and consider it on the merits it will suspend the finality of the judgment i dont think thompson has to read has to be read to stand for a broader equitable principle the other thing id say about thompson is that for better or for worse the governments brief in opposition in thompson and the case was decided on the cert papers didnt cite N usc N it relied exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the federal rule of appellate procedure therefore the court in thompson was not required to grapple with congressionally imposed limits 
 thank you mr stewart mr mancino you have four minutes remaining 
 if this were a case where someone just missed the N day deadline i dont think we would be talking we are talking about a case where a judge properly found properly ruled that notice was not given and had the authority to reopen the case and we talk about mandatory and jurisdiction of the case all that were involved in this case is how is the case moved from one court to another and the was it moved properly in this case the unique circumstances i think you cannot find a more compelling case for unique circumstances did the party rely upon the court here you have a handwritten notation from the court signed by the judge 
 mr mancino does the record tell us how you got notice of that order 
 no it doesnt but i mean i did get notice of it it came in the mail but it doesnt 
 you you got that order in the mail 
 in the mail correct and thats why i believe the three days was added thinking of the mail rule that we have three additional days to do it in connection with the case and thats how i believe the how the N days came up 
 and i asked this once before did the document you received show the dates that it was entered on the docket so you knew when the N days was running from 
 no the only information it had was the printed the printed date by the judge did not show it was entered that same day 
 yeah but in the in this thing it says entered on february N 
 yeah thats correct the docket does show that 
 but how did you find out it had been entered on february N because you did know that at the time you filed your notice of appeal 
 well i just went off what the date on the the handwritten date on the pleading we received from the court it said february N so we just put it in there didnt go to the actual docket to see if in fact it was entered as you can see orders were not in this case were not entered on date that the judge signified anyway 
 this is this is all at the top of page N of the joint appendix right thats the that entire thing 
 that is the well it is printed on that but i mean if you look at the original document 
 yes it was handwritten 
 its a handwritten handwritten by the judge in in the case so 
 but it says when it was signed by the judge it doesnt say when it was entered on the docket when it was entered by the clerk 
 no it says when the judge signed it thats correct 
 but it says it in the index it says it says docket entries N it says entered N on page N on page N 
 yeah thats correct but thats from the docket 
 received so 
 but the document we received from the court just has you know the handwritten notation on it file your appeal by 
 what would you what would you have had to have done to find out when it was entered on the docket could you have accessed that electronically or would you have to go to the court to 
 well probably i could not have at that time i mean i could do it now but at that time youd have to go over to the courthouse just like we walked on orders of appeal over to the courthouse had it stamped by the clerk there and figured that was the end of it and we were on our way to the sixth circuit in cincinnati thanks 
 thank you mr mancino the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in N claiborne versus united states mr dwyer 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the district courts N month sentence combined with N years of supervised release conditioned on drug treatments and the acquisition of a ged was a reasonable sentence in the uniform and constant tradition of federal criminal sentencing the district judge in this case treated mario claiborne as an individual she considered the guidelines and after doing so turned to the judgment that N demands in every case she issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted disparity to impose just punishment and to ensure that deterrence did not throw away mario claibornes chances to resume his responsibilities to himself to his family and to his community the court of appeals in contrast to the district courts careful attention to the N factors focused solely on the guidelines the court of appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule that rule retethers sentencing to the guideline 
 what would be your test of reasonableness for appellate review 
 i think a sentence would be reasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and circumstances of that case would find that the sentence imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to satisfy N standards 
 it seems to me that gives very little weight to the goal which i think is a congressional goal of nationwide consistency in eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system which cause great disrespect to the justice system 
 i think that the statute speaks of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of uniformity and there is necessarily a tension between the individualized sentencing that N requires and concerns about nationwide uniformity but i think that what distinguishes sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the presentencing reform act system are several one is now we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors the judge must consider N didnt exist before that time secondly in every case as a practical matter the guidelines are going to exert a gravitational weight because they are there they must be considered as part of the statute 
 can i substitute substantial for gravitational without offending your position or affecting your position 
 i dont my position would be that N is the correct place for consideration of the guidelines its just one of seven factors as a practical matter i think its going to get 
 kind of a weak law of gravity like the moon its only at oneseventh 
 as a legal matter weak as a practical matter i think unfortunately its going to be very strong and i think one of the real dangers of an advisory guideline 
 well i guess the question is how strong should we say or can we say or can congress say it is 
 i think that the strength should be no more than one of the N factors because i think the danger particularly after N years of guideline sentencing is that courts will routinely and mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of exercising their discretion which now runs to the full limit of N 
 then it seems to me that to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in this case you almost remove the appellate courts from the process 
 i think the appellate courts are i think booker considered a very deferential standard of review the cases that the booker court cited to illustrate the standard of review of reasonableness were all highly deferential decisions regarding revocations following supervised release affirming sentences that were many times what the chapter N policy guidelines would require the court of appeals necessarily must be deferential or i think it pushes the system back into a mandatory 
 well suppose the court of appeals had done exactly what it did in this case but it said we are not giving any special weight whatsoever to the guidelines we are basing this just on our own evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in the sentencing reform act would there be a problem there 
 i think there would justice alito because i dont think that the role of the appellate court is to substitute its judgment for the application and weight applied to the N factors for the district court 
 thats a principle that you derive from what from the sixth amendment from the sentencing reform act from where 
 well i think it derives in part from the sentencing reform act which contemplated individualized sentencing 
 the sentencing reform act required as enacted by congress required trial judges to apply the guidelines to follow the guidelines and you are saying that the sentencing reform act now precludes appellate review of it gives the trial judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad discretion 
 certainly extremely broad discretion 
 how do you get that out of the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion 
 even under a mandatory guidelines system that this court considered in koon it recognized that the sentencing reform act also had an important goal of individualized sentencing and the court in koon recognized that district courts in their institutional position have a special competence to determine whats ordinary in a case whats unusual in a case the court of appeals lacks that special competence it sees only a tiny fraction of the number of guideline cases it doesnt have 
 so one of the guides for reasonableness review is whats ordinary in a particular type of case 
 i think that what guides the court of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to the particular case and determine if the reasons on the record in that case the district courts 
 its impossible to do in the abstract if you are just looking at a particular case you have no idea whether N years is reasonable or not there has to be a background to it so that you know that in this type of case people usually get a sentence of N years or they usually get a sentence of N years and it seems to me that whats ordinary is going to be a judge a driving fact in determining whats reasonable 
 i think the court of appeals job is to ensure that the district judge provides reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of that case that establish that the district court had complied with N and on the facts of that case selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater than necessary i dont believe that it is the court of appeals job as was remarked earlier to become a sentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh district courts decisions 
 even if you are looking at not just the number but the reasons in other words the question i asked earlier you have got nine district judges they all say we do not depart downward for military service and you have got one district judge that says we do it seems to me that if the court of appeals cant review that to bring about some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to consider then its essentially a lawless system 
 i think it is not lawless in the sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether in a particular case the differences it finds are warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines has looked at the history and characteristics of that defendant has looked at the nature and circumstances of the crime and if those reasons satisfy the court that a reasonable judge looking at those facts 
 on my particular case whats the right answer for the court of appeals they have got two cases before them one the judge departs three years because of military service the prosecutor appeals the other the judge refuses to depart because of military service and the defendant appeals should those what should happen with those two cases 
 i think the same process of review applies to each and it may result and that process of review is on the record in that case would a reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence and that review may result in both cases being reversed one or the other or neither being reversed 
 where does that come from as a matter of law that is suppose now you can say i if you want say my hypothesis is wrong but if i start with an assumption that congress did want the court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in sentencing and it wanted cooperation between the courts of appeals and the sentencing commission indeed the sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a system that exists in britain where courts of appeals create a degree of uniformity suppose i start with that assumption and say thats what the guidelines were about and the reason that number N is in N its not just one factor among many after all it was attached to a bill that was the guideline bill and indeed the part we excised was a floor amendment that came along later to make it even tougher so if i start with the assumption thats what congress wanted not what i wanted congress wanted it now is there something in the constitution that forbids it thats where i start i am starting personally with that question in mind always if this is what congress wanted we should try to do it unless theres something in the constitution that forbids it and is there something in the constitution that would forbid the court of appeals to do what on page N they did here leaving the word extraordinary out of it now just going through the different elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that what the district judge did was unreasonable 
 i think there is a constitutional problem with that and it is that if it reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system and i think if there is to be an effectively advisory system sentencing cannot center on the guidelines the district judge needs to be free to accept or reject that advice and N instead of the guidelines becomes the focal point for sentencing 
 its not mandatory it says the district the court of appeals judge says now lets think here we have N N people on the sentencing commission that have really looked into that and they think that in an ordinary course with this small amount of drugs the person ought to get so many months that reflects a lot of thought seems reasonable to us and here the district judge is giving him half that or N percent of that without a good reason that we can find the judge said he did it because it was just one little episode and we think there were many episodes and thats basically their reason now now what the sixth amendment forbids that 
 of course the court of appeals did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case in 
 yeah 
 the eighth circuit in this case simply said it is not a guidelines sentence it is an extraordinary variance and we are reversing the district court has to consider the sentencing guidelines and generally that must be part of the reason elaboration of judgment so they will necessarily be considered on appeal but the notion somehow that simply because a sentence is in the guidelines all disparity problems have been resolved is clearly not true as the amici briefs and our brief have pointed out even under a mandatory guidelines system racial disparity increased regional disparity increased its disparity that individualized sentencing the judicial discretion necessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing can counteract and that is genuine uniformity as as you pointed out in the koon decision or the koon pointed out borrowing your language from rivera the district courts special competence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is exactly the kind of information the sentencing commission needs to determine whether a guideline works or doesnt work 
 arent you really saying that the most weight that the guidelines can be given or guidelines can be is that i apologize for my voice the most weight the guidelines can be given is is the weight of necessary advertence the guidelines in effect are at odds with the rest of N the rest of them say individualized sentencing the guidelines in effect says no sentencing by the guidelines therefore in order to to break this in effect logical incommensurateness on your view i think the most that you can concede is that before a district judge sentences finally he must show that he has considered the value of uniformity as something different from individualized sentencing but thats as much as he can be required to do is that a fair statement of your position 
 yeah and i think N in fact i expect mr dreeben to say this talks about uniformity twice in the sense that both N which requires consideration of the guidelines and N talks about unwarranted 
 yes i i stand corrected here im sorry 
 but i agree with you that it is a consideration and im not talking about a check list im not saying that we just use a list and thats enough there has to i think sentencing under an advisory system requires reason and judgment we tried to stress in our brief that judgment is somehow different it may involve factfinding but is not the determinant the automatic jury kind of finding that the guidelines require 
 well as one of the themes that you advance you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time i assume they would be adjusted to be more precise but then we are right back where we started because you want to give the guidelines very little effect it seems to me in a way you are arguing against yourself if your view is accepted and the result is considerable disparity i suppose all that congress can do is have mandatory minimums 
 i dont believe that that the results are going to be considerable disparity certainly no more disparity than existed under the mandatory guidelines which wasnt being addressed particularly i think indeed there may be more nonguideline sentences but less true disparity because it really is kind of idle to talk about disparity unless you are measuring it against something and N provides those purposes and true disparity is measured 
 do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the sentencing reform act was adopted you remember those days 
 i do remember those days and i think there are two significant points about that one judges sentenced in the presentencing reform act knowing that their sentence wasnt the real time served so that a judge may say N year sentence knowing the defendant was immediately eligible for parole and was going to get out soon the real number was parole eligibility sentencing so that looking at just the actual sentence imposed did not tell you very much about disparity and none in the study that the sentencing commission in its amicus cited that study explicitly said that none of the studies looking at presentencing reform act interjudge disparity considered actual sentences served as opposed to actual sentences imposed 
 yeah yeah but there you know we can go back into that but there was a whole history that people testified tremendously no opposition virtually none that you needed a judge wheel why do you need a judge wheel in new york if in fact the sentence didnt depend on the personality of the judge and why did you get different sentences across the country which i dont i have never heard a possibility of explaining that the judges didnt understand what the parole commission was like thats a different issue so what what im concerned about is if we followed your position literally what we are saying is that the constitution of the united states prevents any effort to create uniform sentences throughout the country for people who different judges god doesnt tell us what the right sentence is we dont know there are reasonable sentences within a vast vast range of possible sentences and you are saying we have to go back to that and that wasnt im looking in other words for you to tell me something that says we dont have to be back to that but we dont have to make it that rigid either and thats what im looking for to be honest with you and i havent im not certain i get it 
 i dont believe that sentencing under an effectively advisory system under the standards of appellate review that i have described which i think is the standard booker described is in a sense an empty exercise on appeal and leading simply 
 could you describe it again because im not clear what your answer was to what the appellate court stance is i take it the appellate court would owe deference to the district courts determination 
 yes 
 and no particular deference to the guidelines 
 that would yes i would agree with that 
 so what is it other than is this arbitrary and capricious 
 i think that the court of appeals will first look to ensure that there was reasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with N that the district court considered all of the factors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary secondly i think that the court of appeals under that deferential standard of review that booker described would look to see if this is a sentence that a reasonable judge would find sufficient but not greater than necessary on those facts 
 but the one problem is that two judges both reasonable might approach the facts in this very case differently that is one as in this case might think as she expressed it to sentence him to more than N months would throw away his life another might say its its unreal to assume that he just sold N grams of crack when he admitted that he had been out on that same street every night for two and a half weeks so the quantity is much larger and he was in that sense a repeater so im going to sentence him to at least the bottom of the guidelines nothing less those could be reasonable determinations two different reactions that judges would have to the same set of facts 
 yes that is correct and i think that is what will result under an effectively advisory system but here we are talking 
 in any case you you you are not driven to the alternative that justice breyer suggests that there is no way to achieve absolute uniformity its very easy it was what the dissenters in the booker remedial phase urged which is use facts found by the jury and you can have the sentences as rigid as you like it is really only only when you want to let the facts be found by the judge that you come into the difficulty that that we are arguing about but its certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there is no way to achieve determinate sentencing there certainly is 
 i agree justice scalia 
 do you agree because i think that system would in fact give total sentencing power to the prosecutor who would determine the sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he introduced and what he charged so i agree that that might produce some kind of judicial uniformity but only because the prosecutor would have total power to decide what the sentence will be 
 well i i also appreciate the dialogue and 
 you dont you dont have to engage in our dispute here 
 we are pointing out there are problems to every solution and thats why im still looking for the 
 and and one of the serious problems in the solution that booker chose is that while judicial discretion which i think N requires and mandates and an advisory system requires that too doesnt deal with the necessary exercise of prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on the scale and which the district court in the day to day work of the criminal system in the courts in the district courts has a far greater appreciation for than a court of appeals would 
 mr dwyer before we get to the prosecutor you were candid in saying a district court different district judges could act reasonably one of them giving whatever it was N months and the other giving N months both of those would be reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal but one of one of the arguments that was made by defense counsel here was just there was there is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack and the penalty for powdered cocaine your predecessor thought that was so wrong he thought it was unconstitutional i think at the very least you ought to take into account that if this man were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered cocaine instead of crack the sentence range the guideline sentence range would have been six months to a year now we know that congress wanted to retain that disparity is a district judge free to say under advisory guidelines i am going to ignore the difference im going to treat this defendant as though he possessed powdered cocaine 
 i think that the judge in the obligation of imposing an individual sentence must consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be free to shape and tailor that advice as the circumstances of that case require 
 well specifically can you take into account can he say im going to treat him as though he possessed powdered cocaine can he do that yes or no 
 yes 
 even though we know that congress didnt want that to happen 
 yes because i think if the judge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in that case 
 thats got nothing to do with that case thats got something to do with a judgment apart from the particulars of the case about whether crack should be treated the same as powdered crack cocaine its got nothing to do with the individual case 
 well i beg to differ chief justice roberts because the differences were predicated on assumptions about the type of individuals who would engage in that and the court in her experience could look at it and say you arent the typical crack defendant you are more like the people who come before me who are involved in powdered cocaine or you dont possess the violence the weaponry and the other things that justified congresss decision to create disparate sentences for these two kinds of cocaine 
 well i think you ran away from justice ginsburgs hypothetical just a little bit lets assume that congress wants to keep this distinction and lets assume that theres no constitutional problem with the distinction there might be but lets assume can the judge simply say i ignore that congressional congressional judgment is wrong im not going to do that 
 i dont think that the district judges role is to make categorical pronouncements 
 is the judge permitted 
 to what extent is the congresss purpose later than the congress that enacted the statute we are construing the statute we are construing was enacted by one congress and these expressions came later 
 well i would resolve the problem by saying that the district judge must consider the guidelines the district judge doesnt sit in review of the policy it has to apply it to a specific person in a particular case as in mario claibornes that policy produced a sentence that would have been too great and the application had some numbers to it so she said it was more serious because it was a crack cocaine case you are going to get more than somebody who was involved with powder would get but you dont need to get as much as the guidelines call for for the reasons that she expressed on the record at the sentencing if i could reserve the balance of my time unless there are other questions 
 thank you mr dwyer mr dreeben 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this court in booker concluded that the remedial severing of the statutes provision for mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the statute constitutional it further implied a standard of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on appeal and it did not elaborate what that reasonableness requirement means the government submits that the best interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would be one that conforms as closely as it can to congresss original intent of minimizing and eliminating unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly situated defendants 
 as closely as it can and the as it can depends upon violation of the sixth amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury suppose in this case the court of appeals instead of disallowing the lower sentence approved it and then in the next case that comes up involving what was the small amount of equivalent N grams of cocaine powder rather than crack okay suppose in the next case it would have been N grams of powder and the district court judge once again departs just the way the departure was here and the court of appeals says no that departure is unreasonable you now have circuit law which says N grams you get the guidelines sentence N grams you are entitled to a lesser sentence okay why isnt why havent we fallen back into the same problem that produced booker or fanfan you have fact findings being made by the judge its a judge who decides whether its N grams or N grams what difference does it make whether that factual difference produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a series of opinion by a court of appeals isnt the sixth amendment equally violated 
 justice scalia as i think we talked about in the last argument in theory it could be if this court concludes that judicial determinations on appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a commission or statute and if what the court of appeals does is essentially function as a sentencing commission literally prescribing particular levels of punishment for recurring sets of facts the governments submission here is not that the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a proportionality principle a proportionality principle will look to all of the facts of the case and will try to get a handle on is this a reasonable sentence in response to all of the facts and circumstances that the judge articulated within 
 but if you have two cases that are in other respects similar and the court of appeals has held N is too little to apply the guidelines its okay to depart downward the way this judge did it seems to me that the next case that comes up the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence 
 well he doesnt justice scalia because the second defendant may not encounter a judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same level of leniency or any leniency at all that judge will retain the judges classic discretion to look at the totality of the facts and conclude whether a sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable sentence and unlike a situation that some of us might prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that like cases are treated with reasonable consistency the system of reasonableness review on top of advisory guidelines will not produce perfect levels of consistency and what the defendant is entitled to under the sixth amendment rulings of this court is knowing that if the law says if i commit this crime and these are the facts that support it my level of sentence is this and no higher that any higher sentence thats produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial entitlement thats what the sixth amendment entitles you but no defendant who commits a crack offense can say that even after a series of court of appeals rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness that defendant will not know whether the judge that he or she appears in front of will give the same kind of weight to those facts as some other judge did who was affirmed or reversed nor will that judge be able to say what is the constellation of policy and factual reasons that this particular judge will find in announcing the judges sentence so i dont think that a proportionality principle runs afoul of the sixth amendment and i dont think that it runs afoul of anything in N or any other part of the statute what the court is left with is the task of interpreting reasonableness and i submit it should ask the same question that it asked in booker itself which alternative the petitioners alternative in this case or the governments conforms more closely to congresss original claim in the sentencing reform act the petitioners version of appellate review as i understand it is very light review if at all of the substance of what the district judge does it may reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a second degree murderer i think probation is the appropriate sentence perhaps the petitioner would concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational but beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to arise that petitioner can feel free to give it away petitioner gives the court nothing and gives the courts of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine whether a particular sentence is reasonable and that is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when eight of them have adopted this proportionality principle 
 may i ask this question it seems to me that in sentencing there are two different broad categories of decision that the judge has to make one involving the severity of the crime and the other the characteristics of the particular offender and might it not be the case that you give a greater presumption of following the guidelines when you are talking about the severity of the offense and a greater deference to the trial judge when you are evaluating the factors of the individual that might affect the sentence there might be a difference in the 
 i think at a high level of generality that is true because what the sentencing commission is good at is taking paradigmatic circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that will transfer into a sentence and what the strength of the district judge is is looking at the defendant in front of that particular judge and seeing how that persons characteristics may map onto the policies of sentencing but i dont agree that that distinction would support a twotrack form of appellate review that would give the district judge greater deference to take personal characteristics into account and to impose widely varying sentences that is exactly the situation that we had in the pre sentencing reform act era when any district judge could choose whatever policies of sentencing appeal to that judge find the facts and impose a widely disparate sentence and as the court well knows there was no appellate review of that exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the judge didnt exercise discretion at all now it is not an exercise of discretion if a judge simply says for this crime i always give the same sentence that would not take into account the full range of facts and factors that are present in the sentencing court and as a result that wouldnt be an exercise of discretion but in the pre sentencing reform act era the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what facts mattered if we continue with that same sort of deference on appeal in the booker remedial opinion then its hard for me to see how appellate review can serve any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some consistency and uniformity in the way district judges impose sentencing 
 what do you think about taking some of the rivera ideas im slightly hypothesizing this and following up with what justice stevens said youd say look one thing a district judge cant say he cant say that i believe the guideline is right for a typical case and i think this is a typical case and i wont follow the guideline you couldnt think those three things 
 i agree 
 so one big power a judge has that they didnt have before after booker is to say the guideline itself is unreasonable so we are lets just say and there if they say that the district judge could decide whether or not the court of appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not reasonable but leave those cases aside i imagine they will be few and far between now we take one they assume is reasonable and now unlike the past the judge has to do three things one to give the kind of thing that the reason hes not following the guideline which he admits is reasonable for a typical case so whats the kind of thing that leads you to think yours is not typical and he says it and then he has the evidence as to the related facts and then he has the degree of departure as to the first thing the court of appeals could review it and decide whether it is or is not the kind of thing as to the second and third they also could review it but only after giving considerable weight to what the district judge thinks about the case in front of him now maybe thats i mean you might not have a reaction to that id have to sort of think about it 
 well justice breyer if the system that you are describing is a replica of the system that existed under koon versus united states 
 not quite 
 then it runs into the same problem that led to the constitutional problem in booker where i think i would amend your honors proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a typical case but the guideline really doesnt prescribe what i think is a reasonable sentence and here are the reasons why in the presentencing in the prebooker system that could have been problematic legally today it is not forbidden but what it should be subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal that take a look at what are the reasons that the district judge articulated for that sentence 
 why why do we assume that the district judge cannot depart from the guideline recommendation unless he thinks the guideline recommendation is unreasonable he doesnt does he have to find its unreasonable there can certainly be two reasonable sentences and hes under no obligation to select the guidelines sentence is he 
 thats correct 
 so he doesnt have to determine that its unreasonable i dont think we should approach the discussion as though thats thats the situation 
 i do think though that the court should be concerned about each district judge formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing guidelines and then applying them in the court to the cases that appear on that judges docket without any check on appellate review to ensure that although the sentence might be in some possible world reasonable its out of whack with what the sentencing commission has prescribed and what other district judges are doing if there is no check on appeal then i do think that the clock has been turned back to the N era before the sentencing reform act and that does not seem to me a reasonable interpretation of what the booker remedial opinion thought it was accomplishing what the booker remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was providing an important mechanism that congress itself had intended namely appellate review in order to iron out sentencing differences and our submission is that inherently means some form of substantive proportionality review 
 thats the other thing im not certain about the proportionality and the reason im not certain of it is im not certain what it means that is it sounds nice as if you are saying something but proportional to what i mean i can think of two problems one problem of course is that the chart in the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and that means that if you move from one level from N to N its N months or N months if you move from N to N its N years now whether you are at N or whether you are at N and N might depend upon things that just have nothing to do with your reason for departure you might have added on something for having a gun and your reason for being lenient might have to do with the persons having a gun so you are going to say it make a difference whether you were high up or whether you were low down when your reason for departing has nothing to do with whether you are high up or whether you were low down you see it doesnt actually work i dont think proportionality review because its so hard to say whats proportional 
 i think what is proportional is a matter of common sense and the eight circuits that have been using this rule have not had a great deal of difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to which the sentence varies from the guidelines range you look at the absolute amount of time thats involved and have a sense of is this a significant deviation away from what the guidelines would actually describe 
 well why use the word proportional because the other thing is what the chief justice brought out is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason i mean why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot and if he has a good reason well why doesnt it justify a lot just as much as it might justify a little 
 if the sentencing court articulates a bad reason namely a reason thats irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the case then that really shouldnt justify the sentence at all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate it send it back for resentencing and allow the district court to articulate the reasons why the sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an appropriate sentence under N 
 mr dreeben if we could focus on the facts of this case and what the district court appeared to do she made a kind of proportionality judgment too she said this is a young man its his first offense he has a good family relationship a good work record i am making a determination that will put him away for a significant amount of time but im trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch with his family with his work he will be thrown away that was the judgment that she made she tried to make a sentence that would be significant N months but that would not be so long that it would put him out of touch with his children and his wife and his work now in by some measures that would be entirely reasonable but on your measure it isnt reasonable 
 thats right and i think justice ginsburg you have done a better job of articulating a justification for the sentence than the judges own articulation which did not focus on family separation and employment to the degree that you have now articulated it what the judge did was focus on the quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didnt have any criminal history and that he qualified for the safety valve she also said without specifying any other cases that other cases that have come before my court have had you know perhaps larger quantity of drugs and very different sentences when a court of appeals is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is reasonable it makes sense for the court to ask do we know anything for example about what this judge is saying about other cases with other drug quantities theres no specifics in the record that enable the court of appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of that observation its also relevant for the court of appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken into account all of the factors that this judge has previously noted and what has happened in the sentence is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence for reasons that the commission already took into account now that doesnt prohibit the judge from relying on those facts but it does mean that the farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity 
 but you did leave out what she didnt elaborate on it but she said i would be throwing him away and i take it what she was saying by that is it would be he would be incarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate into the community 
 well this brings me to my last point about this particular sentencing which is that in this very case judge jackson looked at the defendant she said candidly i dont know really very much about you other than what i have learned about in the presentence report and i cant tell whether you are unlucky or you are stupid and then effectively gave him a sentence that reflected you know a tremendous indulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a wakeup call and nothing more what she ignored is his own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a street corner for N or N months selling crack cocaine that he was arrested and placed into the state system put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug court in essence being said heres your chance you know straighten up we are going to be lenient on you we are going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate with your family and what did the defendant do but get caught within N months with N grams of crack and on that record and this is what the court of appeals said theres a disconnect between the judges conclusion that with little information more than what she had in the psr the kid deserved leniency versus the fact that he had already had that chance and he had not 
 yes but didnt the court of appeals draw the inference that he had been distributing drugs during that N month period and that was not supported by the record am i wrong on that 
 well justice stevens we are not relying on the inference of the 
 would it have been error for the court of appeals to find a fact like that that was not supported by the record and didnt it do it in this case 
 well supported by the record is something of a judgment call youd have to assume that mr claiborne was found by the police N months after he had previously been arrested for crack offenses holding a N gram bag of crack and that was the very first time after his arrest that he had been in possession of drugs that just he got extremely unlikely the police caught him 
 and the court of appeals is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in fact distributed during that N month period 
 thats right and i would say that a reasonable factfinder could draw that conclusion 
 but should the court of appeals act as a factfinder in that posture of the case 
 not in my view and i think on this record thats not a fact that we are relying on its not a fact that the government 
 is it not possibly a fact that would justify the conclusion that they committed error 
 this aspect of the court of appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the judgment that it reached which is correct 
 it may not have been essential but it may have contributed to their judgment 
 it may have but what they did not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist even though he had no criminal history he had been previously arrested for crack distribution crimes he had admitted that this was not the occasion of his arrest wasnt the first opportunity that he had to deal crack hed been doing it for N or N months and the judge essentially turned all of those facts off she did not really factor that into her sentence at all and the court of appeals although it may have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had treated him as the record does indeed support the court of appeals central conclusion which is this defendant despite his criminal history really looks more like a recidivist and when you are talking about a defendant whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been N years but who gets out of that sentence because he satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is a firsttime offender and meets certain other requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory minimum that defendants culpability had already been substantially reduced under the guidelines because of the safety valve and because of his criminal history and the judge basically said im going to take a chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than what the guidelines described our view is the judge can look at the facts she looked at but she went down to a level that is productive of unwarranted disparity 
 may i ask just one other question i do not understand you to argue that the court of appeals can apply a presumption of unreasonableness just because theres a departure 
 thats correct we are not arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal we are arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a guidelines sentence for an out of guidelines sentence there is no presumption that it is unreasonable but the court of appeals under a proportionality analysis would look and require increasingly strong reasons with the increasing degree of variance from 
 thats the part they said that an extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances what worries me about that it sounds like a slogan i would think an extraordinary reduction must be supported by whatever reasons that justify the extraordinary reduction period and it also sounds like you are going to start getting a mechanical set of charts and things which is going to be a true nightmare and if we really were to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force of generative law which would worry me quite a lot because i just think its too complex to reduce to a formula what you want is a reason that supports the sentence it is 
 i think you want a better reason for a sentence that is farther away from some mean 
 better than what better than justifies it 
 perhaps the best way to do this is to give a example suppose that the shoe were on the other foot suppose that judge jackson had looked at this defendant and said you know this defendant did not learn from his experience he was given leniency in the state court he didnt take advantage of that opportunity his statutory maximum is N years and im going to give him maybe not the statutory maximum im going to give him an N year sentence or suppose she said a N year sentence or a N year sentence i submit that in that circumstances the petitioner would be here saying well the guidelines recommended a sentence of between N and N months and this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is not something thats particularly unusual its a very usual reason and as a result the magnitude of this deviation is unreasonable and i have no problem with a petitioner making that argument if thats what happens to his or her client my problem is that without that kind of anchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality review a court of appeals has almost nothing to work with 
 but what happens when that case it goes back down to the district court the district court says well okay not N years nine years okay it goes back up i mean you know when do we end this game or does the court of appeals take over the sentencing function and specify you know five years 
 justice scalia i dont think that the courts of appeals are at least absent very unusual circumstances to act as sentencers to specify a sentence there have been a couple of instances where courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on this particular constellation of facts i think that reflect as sense of potential impatience with a pingpong game that would occur if the court of appeals says your sentence is unreasonable mr district judge and the district judge imposes a sentence thats one day lower another solution to that problem would be reassignment to a different judge who would start with a clean slate and could read the court of appeals opinion and apply the section N factors we are not suggesting that the court of appeals should assume the sentencing role here all we are suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to identify and select unreasonable sentences versus reasonable sentences and when you have wide statutory ranges as you do in the federal system if you dont have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark its not more then i dont think courts of appeals have a good coherent consistent way of fulfilling their tasks and if the courts of appeals can do that can look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the farther that it goes outside the guidelines range without violating the statute and without violating the constitution then it seems to me the only thing for the court to ask at that point is which approach that approach of proportionality or and approach that basically says appellate review is procedural only absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences conforms to congresss intent of producing a greater degree of uniformity and consistency 
 well it wouldnt be just be procedural only you you could say procedural plus you know certainly review of the facts on on which the district court was was proceeding so you if you could find that the determination that this was just a good kid who made a mistake is is an unreasonable finding you could reverse for that reason 
 that that is true but i submit that i would like to hear what petitioner has to say if petitioners client had been given N years in this case i have no doubt that petitioner would be arguing thats an unreasonable sentence but i dont see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court has articulated a rationale thats consistent with section N and a rational interpretation of the facts unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the analysis thank you 
 thank you mr dreeben mr dwyer you have two minutes remaining 
 i believe that justice breyer put his finger on one of the central problems with the governments proposed rule and that is what does it mean the government talks about substantial variances in petitioners case the court of appeals spoke of it as extraordinary variances and the government doesnt suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or means something different from extraordinary and we have already demonstrated in our brief why relying on percentages as the court of appeals also did is pointless because one if the arithmetic gets very complicated at the low end and the percentages just dont make any sense from a proper application of a rule of law the governments proposal apart from having no basis in the statute and no basis in booker is just not susceptible of any kind of application because nobody really knows what it means 
 what about mr dreebens parting challenge what are you going to do if your client gets N years you are going to argue thats an extraordinary departure from the guidelines right 
 im certainly going to argue that under the facts and the record before the court that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not greater than necessary and i think the absence of a prior record the young mans work history all of those factors the low amount of crack cocaine involved his age all of the things which as justice ginsburg pointed out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision could not possibly support a N year sentence and you know it is easy to do this in a in a hypothetical sort of way but the district judge and this was a very experienced district judge looking at the person in the eye made a call based on judgment and that call was not treated with any respect in the court of appeals it was sloganeered away as an extraordinary variance and because the court of appeals focused only on the guidelines the this court in crafting the appellate standard cant just look to determine what congress might have intended because of the constitutional problem that lurks behind it and that constitutional problem is a resumption of mandatory guidelines thank you very much 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in case N rita versus united states mr cochran 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court under the system described in justice breyers opinion for the court in booker judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the guidelines that of course was a passage from this courts recent decision in cunningham versus california mr rita is asking the court in this case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it meant what it said in booker that the guidelines are merely advisory provisions the governments assertion that the guidelines deserve a presumption of reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the booker decision the ink wasnt given a chance to dry on the booker decision before the department of justice issued a memo to all of its federal prosecutors directing that they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary cases the district court below in this case did not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a N month within guideline sentence the district court did not consider mr ritas military record the fact that he had been a combat soldier in two wars 
 how can you say that given that at the sentencing hearing that military record was brought out his physical ailments were brought out his activity in law enforcement all that was brought out and indeed the judge was assisting the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it was presented 
 in the district court mr rita did put forward evidence of his military records health concerns he the district court received that information the district court did not consider that information because theres nothing in the record where the district judge weighed any of that information to determine what what effect to give any of it 
 well you know you dont get a summary judgment case all the time i used to get them and the district court would hear all the arguments and write down the word denied does that mean he didnt consider the arguments thats a very common thing here we have a district judge he hears all the arguments the attorneys brought it out its in the file he reads the presentence report its all there and the judge says on balance im going to go apply the guidelines so how can you say he didnt consider them 
 justice breyer the district judge didnt say that we are going to weigh all of the stuff and i 
 no he doesnt in a summary judgment case either i mean i have had quite a few of them i used to i think where they just wrote denied that was the opinion 
 well in the instance of a summary judgment matter we dont have N that requires the district court to state in open court in front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of sentence 
 now he says the reasons are these i think that the guidelines sentence is a reasonable sentence would that be sufficient 
 it would not your honor 
 why not what in the statute or the law or the constitution says that a district judge although it might be good form in a difficult case to write more but i have often written opinions where i say and the remaining arguments we feel are not sufficient to change the result that means i dont think they are that great an argument and i dont answer every single one 
 with regard to the first question your honor posed its not sufficient for the district court to simply state conclusions which is what happened in this case that 
 where in the law does it say that 
 well in N it requires that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence 
 where im looking at that it says shall consider am i missing something 
 the preamble states 
 can you give me your page cite 
 im sorry your honor on page N a of petitioners brief in the appendix it states the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence and thats what we contend requires the district court to explain the facts that the court is relying on to impose the particular sentence in the case 
 so it isnt sufficient in your view that the judge just says the reason i imposed this sentence is thats the guideline sentence and i think in this circumstance its reasonable 
 thats correct your honor because the guidelines dont take into account all the myriad facts and in this case did not take into account the military record the employment record mr ritas health concerns the guidelines specifically did not take those into account 
 i think these other factors that have been brought out while they are serious factors i dont think they are enough to warrant a different sentence suppose he adds those words 
 your honor i think the 
 what im worried about basically is i dont think in the law theres a special category that requires a judge to give special reasons in a guideline case i think its the same as any other matter judges do normally give reasons and id worry a bit about creating a special situation where district judges have to do something unusual 
 i dont think that this is unusual your honor i think the court has to explain the rationale for imposing the sentence and not only does it have to do so in court in front of the defendant so the defendant understands the sentence that he is receiving 
 well i get where you are going can i say this in an opinion would this satisfy you and of course like any other matter judges do normally give reasons they do normally reject arguments with reasons and its the same here would that satisfy you 
 i think it would have to be specific to the issues raised by the parties and in this case at a minimum the judge would have to address the three issues that mr rita put forward and discuss those his military record his employment his health concerns it would have to address any issues that the government would raise and any issues that the district judge was considering that maybe neither party had raised to the court as well 
 how do you reconcile the language in the prologue of which says the court shall state the reasons with which says that if the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range described in of the guidelines the court shall state the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from the guidelines now this seems to set up some dichotomy between giving reasons and giving the specific reason where does that line fall in your estimation 
 well i think foremost your honor is that that provision came about prior to the booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory and what that addresses and what it was meant to address was if the court were to depart then it was it needed to explain that departure in a greater reason to enable the sentencing commission to take that information into account in revising the guidelines that is still a purpose with the sentencing commission to revise the guidelines and they can still use that information but it at the very least we need information from the sentencing judge about each of the matters that he or she 
 you havent answered my question i mean you explain why its put in there but i want to know what is the difference between giving the reasons and giving the specific reason 
 the specific reason i think your honor is so that the sentencing commission can take that information into account in later revisions of the guidelines that was the purpose at the point that statute was passed 
 but are you saying now that that distinction should be ignored 
 i dont know your honor if its so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the district court needs to give as many reasons or as clear a reason for the imposition of the particular sentence that will help 
 but it sounds to me as though you want all the reasons to be specific i mean i understand your argument but if we accept that argument then the distinction between reason and specific reason basically is going to be a matter of history and perhaps it should be 
 it it may your honor and and because that provision predated this courts booker decision it still holds relevance but not nearly the relevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory 
 so your position would be mr cochran that the obligation to be evenhanded would have to that the trial judge would also have to go through now this defendant maintained his innocence he didnt express any remorse he accused a government agent of perjury all that he would have to take into account just as specifically 
 your honor i think that the court certainly could consider all of that and and if pressed by the government would need to consider that but certainly at a minimum the court needs to 
 isnt that what the government pressed at the sentencing hearing 
 it did your honor and again the district court never came out with any specifics regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion that it felt that the guideline range was not inappropriate 
 suppose the district court says i give these following i have considered these following specific factors but in my view the consistency and nationwide uniformity that the guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance and for that reason im following the guidelines 
 i dont 
 is that an inappropriate judgment for the district court to make 
 i think its inappropriate your honor because while there should be uniformity in an attempt to move in that direction uniformity is not the end all and be all N addresses individualized sentencing of the defendant before the court 
 its not the end all suppose the district judge said i think this is of great importance you dont think that the booker opinion or do you think the booker opinion rejected uniformity and consistency as an important factor 
 i dont believe the booker decision rejected that your honor what i believe the booker opinion said was that for there to be advisory guidelines for there to be constitutional sentencing practices then uniformity is going to have to give way to some extent at least at the very beginning once the district courts apply the N factors and go through the statute and consider the guidelines the district courts will then explain their rationale and then that rationale will be in our opinion will show where the shortcomings of the guidelines are 
 mr cochran are you arguing the sentencing in this case violated the sixth amendment 
 not as it was applied it came close in the sense that the district court was laboring in our opinion under the belief that the guidelines held some control 
 if it didnt violate the sixth amendment then your argument is based on the sentencing reform act 
 well it came it may have violated the sixth amendment i dont know that i would concede that but to avoid any constitutional issue if we analyzed this under the statute clearly the district court didnt comply with the statute 
 you cant say whether it did or did not violate the sixth amendment 
 the district court held the guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory 
 well was your clients sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been submitted to the jury 
 well under under a pure advisory system and i think your honor is addressing the crossreference in this matter in a purely advisory system the guidelines were calculated correctly in mr ritas case because under a purely advisory system the district court could look at that crossreference understand that it came about from uncharged and unproven conduct and disregard it but by not doing so in this case and that cross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range then this case may very well be unconstitutional because of the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines 
 mr cochran you do contend do you not that if the guidelines had been mandatory there would have been a violation of the sixth amendment 
 no question your honor 
 because of the the accessory after the fact point 
 thats right your honor absolutely 
 then the question ultimately is does it violate the sixth amendment to say that we have a presumption there a sentence is in the guidelines as a reasonable if you are an appellate court judge and you think it does violate the sixth amendment 
 our position is that the presumption does violate the sixth 
 then i guess the argument of the other side which i would like you to address is that in which there we didnt think it violated the of sixth amendment if the district judge simple applied N uh N and of course N includes all of these things that go into the guidelines it make a big point of that in N so why why couldnt you say you know all these factors are taken into account by the commission they start with an effort to a apply them in typical cases this is their judgment in typical cases so it is entitled to some kind of weight and at least in a typical case 
 your honor the guidelines should be consulted no question 
 no no not consulting them what im trying to do is to how much weight can a judge reading this give them without violating the sixth amendment all im trying to do here is not whether the guidelines are good bad or indifferent congress wanted to apply them we excised the mandatory to comply with the sixth amendment now what else do we have to do to comply with the sixth amendment because i would think unless we have to do something else we shouldnt do it because congress wanted it 
 i would contend your honor that the court needs to very clearly explain that the guidelines are are a reference they are 
 the guidelines are what 
 are a reference 
 can you say it is an initial benchmark 
 i dont when we start establishing benchmarks and presumptions i think thats where we we 
 so benchmarks are bad presumption is bad great weight thats bad 
 thats bad too and i think its just another thing to consider 
 does it matter what judge did in other cases i mean if we look on the day before he said well the guidelines say this but i think this case is different so im going to depart and the day after he says i know what the guidelines are but im going to impose a higher sentence i mean how do we know hes when he says i looked at the guidelines and i think they are appropriate that hes considering himself bound by something that he may or may not agree with as opposed to what he said which is well i cannot find that they are inappropriate 
 and what that tells me mr chief justice is that that the district court felt that the guidelines had a center of gravity that the judge was bound in other words shifted the burden to the defendant to say well i unless you can show that these are inappropriate that it is a setting of a benchmark its a drawing of a line and we contend that that is what the sixth amendment prohibits if the guidelines are advisory if they are but one of many factors to be considered together with all of the other factors in N the court can use that information can use that reference but once it starts putting any greater weight on the guidelines and the statute doesnt admit to that 
 how about the point that justice breyer made that these other factors have been taken into account by the sentencing commission because congress told them to consider those same factors 
 well your honor the sentencing commission by its own admission has not taken into account all of the factors in the very first guideline manual N the sentencing commission itself said it could not take into account all of the facts that play into human conduct 
 there are two separate things there the general aims of sentencing the four basic aims of sentencing i believe the commission certainly took into account a separate thing was the rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has not been fully considered by the guidelines and there the original version i believe said that we have considered nothing thoroughly except for certain specific matters that had been mentioned like age race and we will refer to statutorily now that is what you are thinking of i mean if thats what you are thinking of i dont think its relevant to what your present point is 
 im not your honor first of all i dont know and would contend that the initial sentencing commission did not take into account all of the four purposes of sentencing they centered on crime control 
 thats because when they looked at all of the literature they explained it the rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasnt taken into account it was there was a consensus among experts that there isnt much you can do about it thats different from not taking into account 
 the other point i think with regard to that your honor is in looking at N that statute gives the district court the dual commands of first considering all of those factors and then imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary the statute does not give to the sentencing commission that obligation 
 mr cochran i have this concern if we accept your submission that the district court should just consider the guidelines together with everything else give them a presumption of validity anything else just something to consider that would presumably eliminate any sixth amendment problem with the district courts findings of fact but the district courts sentence is going to go on appeal and the appellate court in reviewing it for reasonableness lets assume in this case the appellate the appellate court says oh no this person had we find as a matter of fact given the record military service you know which we think should have been taken into account and therefore we set it aside now the next case that comes up which doesnt have the element of military service in all other respects the same as your clients case it comes up to the court of appeals and the court of appeals would say ah we dont have that different fact here and therefore we affirm the sentence isnt in other words isnt the finding of a fact necessary for the process of judicial review even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the district courts determination he would not get that sentence but for this fact 
 thats correct your honor and 
 so you havent shown us a way out of the problem 
 in a purely advisory system the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and maximum and as this court has said in cunningham if the court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and maximum then the factual finding as to where within that is up to the district court its only when we establish thresholds as the guidelines do we run into the constitutional problem 
 no even if you dont dont establish thresholds by reason of the guideline you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review guidelines or not if the if the appellate court says oh given theres this fact in this case the sentence below was reasonable but in the next case where that fact does not exist the court of appeals says ah the sentence is unreasonable in other words that fact is made a necessary condition for giving the higher sentence so you havent you havent solved the problem of the of the apparent conflict between between booker and the advisory guidelines 
 well i think so long as the district court can evaluate and consider and potentially reject what the guidelines say just as the court can consider the effect of of the persons military record mr rita was a combat veteran in two wars which is separate and apart from someone who may have been an army recruiter 
 you are not focusing on my point i concede that the district court is free as a bird free as a bird but you have appellate review and the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness is going to make a particular fact determinative of whether this sentence can stand or not isnt that right 
 it is 
 and thats going to be a problem 
 i think what the court would have the appellate court would have to do is evaluate all of that through the prism of N is the sentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction that the court below could have imposed and if not for whatever reasons vacate it and return it back to the district court 
 counsel what if there werent guidelines at all and the district court said maybe you know its new i want to see what other judges have done he presses a button on the computer give me what the sentences were looking at these facts and finds out in the last N cases this is what the sentence was and he says this seems to me no different than those and thats the sentence im going to impose is there any problem with that 
 there is and again because N is an individual weighing of the defendant 
 yes well he looks at all the individual factors and he says they seem not terribly different from these N other cases and the range in those N other cases was you know N to N years and so im going to give him N years 
 if the district court considers all those facts and considers what may have been done and it is sufficient if not greater than necessary given those facts then the court can do that 
 how is that different than the how is that different than looking at the guidelines which did that in a much more comprehensive way and saying i dont see anything different in this case from the normal guidelines case and so im going to impose that sentence 
 well the guidelines didnt take everything into account and the sentencing courts were coming from N years of mandatory guidelines of being required to follow this book that necessarily didnt incorporate all of the human factors in sentencing and they have held to that 
 well it did incorporate them in that district judges were free to depart from the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one of these human factors not considered by the guidelines which existed in the particular case 
 in theory yes justice scalia but in practice no because what happened in the very cases as united states versus foy out of the ninth circuit the defendant in that case argued to the district court that he should have a departure based upon lack of mutual guidance and it was a reasoned decision it went to the ninth circuit the ninth circuit found it to be a reasoned decision and within the next amendment process of the sentencing commission it was eliminated as a departure basis with no discussion at all so yes there may have been departures but they were systematically removed and in fact chapters N and N show that very clearly 
 well if they were systematically removed then all of these other human factors that you are complaining about were considered by the guideline commission and were simply rejected 
 they werent considered your honor and in the history of those amendments thats borne out and if the court has no further questions id like to reserve some time 
 thank you counsel mr dreeben 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the court of appeals appropriately applied a presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that this court announced in united states versus booker the guidelines represent the integration of the multiple purposes of sentencing reflected in section N that the district court is obligated to consider the commission also represents an expert body that has considered the various parameters of sentencing and the fact patterns that arise in the federal system and has made an effort over time to arrive at an appropriate 
 isnt it true just to get one thought out on the table that there are factors that the guidelines dont did not consider such as military service 
 justice stevens the commission considered that factor and then determined that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence outside the guidelines 
 but isnt it true that under the guideline no weight is given to military service 
 the guidelines specifically do not give weight to it they permit a judge 
 what should a judge do if he thought some weight should be given to military service 
 under booker the judge should do that that is the difference between an advisory guidelines system and a mandatory guidelines system the judge can give weight to factors that the commission decided should not have weight in the sentencing process that is the essence of what it means for the guidelines 
 and presumably cannot give weight to factors that the commission decided should have weight 
 he can do that too justice scalia 
 are we back to the original version which i will read what it says it says with a few specific exceptions race sex national origin creed religion socioeconomic state with those exceptions the commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case thats what it said a part of the guidelines in the heartland if its not the heartland depart now what i wonder is are we not back under your theory of it just to where we were when it started out before the commission started ruling all these things out and began to make all its the judge could do that 
 i think we are back justice breyer to a further point even than the first set of guidelines because even under the first set of guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that wasnt taken into account 
 we said we took nothing into account and therefore any circumstance that makes the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an exception 
 i understand that justice breyer 
 you are saying more than that is necessary 
 i think that the reconciliation of this courts merits opinion in booker and its remedial opinion in booker does dictate that the judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence thats different from whats described in the guidelines 
 he could do this he could set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline itself is unreasonable that is it doesnt properly take account of sentencing but suppose he doesnt do that then if you take your view that theres a presumption in its favor and if it is the normal case not an unusual case in any respect how can he not apply the guideline 
 justice breyer i think we have to distinguish between what the job of the district court is and what the job of the appellate court is and in this case the government is arguing for a presumption of reasonableness on appeal once the district judge has determined that the guidelines sentence aligns with his own application of the section N factors our submission here is that a court of appeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable sentence the defendant of course has the opportunity or the government if the government has appealed to show that that presumption is overcome 
 but unless there is a way to calibrate the strength of the presumption theres no clear way to distinguish the presumption from the mandate the mandate is gone you say yes they consider other things but unless we can calibrate the presumption in some way that says you know a mandate was force N and a presumption is a force N something like that theres no way to tell the two apart in practice 
 justice souter im not sure that that would be true even if what we were talking about was a direction to the district judge to presume that he would impose a guidelines sentence but thats not what we are talking about the district judge does not operate and does not have to operate under the position that we are arguing for with a presumption that the judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless persuaded otherwise the judges obligation is to 
 he doesnt have to do it unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed 
 i would think that what the judge wants to do is be sure that hes complied with his statutory obligations 
 well perhaps i misunderstood justice souters question but i have this concern and i thought it was his concern as well at the appellate level is the presumption something that can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing or is it just an initial benchmark we are playing with standards and words here 
 well we are 
 and when we talk about presumptions at the appellate level thats actually a little strange in any event you usually talk about presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact 
 thats true justice kennedy but i think what it reflects at the appellate level is that the court of appeals enters the case with an attitude that our job is to decide whether what the district judge did was reasonable we can operate 
 so we write that this is an additive thing 
 yes i think that its not so different from the court of appeals saying we can enter this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges that shows us a good reason otherwise 
 well is your view on your view is the appellate court engaging in some kind of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence only if it is shown to be unreasonable 
 the latter justice souter and i think that in that regard there is a range of reasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a given set of facts 
 well if you if you have that two criminals criminal defendants with the same identical background and everything else one judge says i think military service should be taken into account so im going to depart from the guidelines by N years the judge next door says i dont think it should be taken into account so im going to impose the guideline sentence both cases are appealed they are consolidated for argument what is the court of appeals supposed to do uphold both of them 
 the court of appeals can uphold both of them if it concludes that the actual sentence thats imposed is reasonable and in the second case that the court is going to hear today the government argues for a proportionality principle that should govern the review of sentencing 
 what is reasonable is is not merely a sort of number within a spectrum it seems to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of the reasons that are given and in the chief justices view two diametrically opposed reasons are given for two different sentences does the does the appellate court in his example say well i think reasonable people could go either way on that so however it comes out its fine on appellate review isnt that what the court would have to do in order to affirm both sentences other things being equal 
 you are right justice souter and i cant say that that would be the first choice of the congress that enacted the sentencing reform act 
 isnt it clear that it would have been the last choice of the congress 
 it is and its not the first choice of the government either but it strikes me that it is something of an inevitability once this court has declared that mandatory guidelines are impermissible under the constitution if judicial factfinding 
 what does the sixth amendment have to do with the selection of the sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed how can there be a sixth amendment violation if either the guidelines or our case law says military service is or is not a relevant factor i dont see how that has anything to do with anything that you can get out of the sixth amendment 
 it probably does not justice alito but what happened in the first part of booker is that the court declared that the guidelines are advisory and advice its advice that can be accepted or rejected 
 i know but booker says what we are trying to do is to come close to what congress wanted but not violate the sixth amendment now what i think we are talking about now i think i mean you sort of shed some you clarified something very well for me which is that in this case we are talking about the situation where the district judge applies the guidelines sentence and then whats the attitude of the court on appeal and the attitude is going to be well the sentencing commission thinks its okay the judge thinks its okay okay you have to you better show me a good reason to think to the contrary fine but the interesting problem is the problem of the next case which you are now talking about is well what happens if the district judge and when should be the district judge and how free should the district judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence even if its not an unusual case 
 let me try to address that and try to address justice alitos point about the question of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the sentencing commission or congress before a sixth amendment problem arises as i understand this courts sequence of opinions from apprendi leading up to the most recent decision in cunningham if the law establishes a level of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts found by the jury and says to the judge judge you may not go above it unless you find a particular fact that fact is subject to the sixth amendment rule that the court has announced and must be found by a jury 
 or some fact not necessarily a particular fact 
 any fact at all as a matter of fact is what the court has said although i understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense and the offender not facts about the world such as the prevalence of crime now what that leads me to conclude is that in order to escape the bright line rule thats been announced in this sequence of cases including booker itself and most recently cunningham a judge must be able to look at the set of facts that the jury found determine what level of punishment would be advised by say a guidelines system and not be bound to impose that level of punishment if the judge feels that a different level of punishment is appropriate if that is a correct understanding of what this court has held it necessarily implies that a judge does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory guidelines system to disagree with what the sentencing commission has found give the judges reasons and then is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of that explanation and the government submits subject to a proportionality principle so that the sentence thats imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and not an arbitrary one now if im wrong about that and it is not necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be able to disagree with what the sentencing commission said that would be very good from the governments perspective but as i understand the complementary rules that are established by booker what an advisory guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be treated as advice rather than mandate so while the guidelines have determined that military service is not ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment a judge may determine in a particular case that he disagrees 
 may i ask you this is the hypothetical supposing a judge thinks military service is relevant and he decides to impose a sentence a little below the guidelines but then he says i recognize that in this circuit there is a strong interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has adopted a rule where they will presume a within guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in those cases and i think with respect to the court of appeals i think i would be wise to impose the guidelines sentence so i will do so even though my own judgment is that it should be slightly lower what should the court of appeals do with such a sentence 
 i think the court of appeals should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of law which is that the judge 
 should reverse the judge then within a a within guidelines sentence 
 in the circumstance justice stevens i think that you put your finger on two different types of review in the circumstance in which a district judge operates with what i will call legal blinders on that prevent him from complying with 
 no he operates with total candor hes saying exactly what he feels like saying 
 im hoping that its a misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said because the court of appeals should not have told the judge you are obligated to impose a guideline sentence 
 well they didnt say you are obligated but you can be pretty sure you will be affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences 
 judges are still obligated to comply with N which requires them to exercise discretion now if a judge decides i might as a personal matter if i were writing the guidelines write them differently and i might give great weight to military service but one of the things that im required to do under section N is to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and have similar records and therefore i am going to moderate my own personal preference and not impose a significant outside the range sentence in order to ensure that i fully have taken into account the fact that we are in a federal system with N federal district judges and we cannot have all our own personal guidelines systems now if a judge does that i dont think theres anything wrong with that i think that judge has actually complied with 
 what if the court of appeals does that what if the court of appeals says we have got N district judges in this circuit nine of them do not take military service into account one does and we think thats inequitable doesnt serve the interest in uniformity and so even though that one judge says in the exercise of my discretion im going to depart we are going to reverse that as unreasonable 
 mr chief justice i think theres a difference between a sentence that varies from what other judges would do and a sentence that is unreasonable if the sentence that is different from what other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and coherent explanation and it is unduly productive of disparity because say it takes a guidelines range like this one of N months to N months and the judge says in my view military service means that this defendant gets probation or to take an example thats on the other side suppose that the judge says this defendant actually didnt get any extra credit in his criminal history for his prior crime but he has been convicted before of lying to the government about his gun charges im now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or near it and give him eight years i think in those circumstances a court of appeals can and should say hold on this is a view that the district judge is entitled to take on the merits hes entitled to give greater weight to that factor whether its aggravating or mitigating than what the guidelines did but not to this extent or we are going to be left with a system in which disuniformity is the main principle 
 its not that complicated all that happens is the court of appeals says look in the case of bank robberies we have discovered about N percent of the defendants in the typical case have been in the army and therefore we think that just ordinary armed services is not a reason ordinary armed services in the military is not a reason for a diminished sentence thats all period or they can say it the other way the absence of a military service is a reason for having the higher sentence put it any way you want and by the way district judge if you disagree with that we are going to reverse you because we think its unreasonable okay what about that 
 that to me sounds identical to the system that preexisted bookers holding 
 it did but is there anything in the sixth amendment that forbids that 
 this court hasnt specifically addressed 
 well what do you think because i would think that if you are going to answer that question yes you are saying that not even the court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness among different defendants in respect to sentencing 
 well justice breyer i would like to be able to answer the question yes and say that courts of appeals can establish their own sublegal rules as 
 its not sublegal rules what its called is precedent what you do is you decide a case and you decide this is unfair and then the thing that as a similar case comes along is you decide it the same way and if a district judge doesnt follow that you reverse it 
 justice breyer if do you that what you have is each court of appeals functioning as a sentencing commission 
 exactly you have simply substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the district court following circuit law for the guidelines and 
 exactly 
 if the guidelines are unconstitutional because they make facts automatically determinative i assume that would be unconstitutional because it makes facts automatically determinative 
 i assume too under the rationale 
 well then in other words the constitution of the united states prevents the courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences who are that individuals who are in similar positions commit similar crimes will be treated in similar ways that to me is possible but of course i have been in dissent in these cases but it seems to me 
 so long as the jury determines the facts that make them similar 
 we are back 
 the problem here is what makes them similar 
 i understand this dialogue and what we have i too have been with the dissenters in these cases and what im trying to argue for here is a set of principles that appellate courts can apply and that district courts can look to when sentencing that will come as close as is reasonably possible to achieving congresss aims in the sentencing reform act without crossing over the bright line rule that this court has announced 
 i dont know how terribly different it is than the normal review for abuse of discretion i mean you dont even need two judges in my earlier question lets say you have the same judge and for three weeks every criminal defendant who comes before him he says i think if you have military service you should get a reduction and then all of a sudden he says i see you have military service but im not going to give you a reduction i mean is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard to be a little bit consistent and if thats the only type of appellate review we are talking about to ensure some degree of consistency in how similar individuals are treated in similar cases i dont see that it raises any concern 
 well mr chief justice im not arguing for any proposition that i think would raise concern i do think that a general tenet of abuse of discretion review is that the court of appeals can affirm a result that it would not necessarily have reached itself 
 mr dreeben may i ask you please to address a point that mr cochran raised i think you were very helpful in saying this presumption for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates a district court sentence that there is no presumption that binds the district judge but one of the main points that mr cochran made in his presentation was the district judge has to give reasons he this was just a summary paragraph at the end of the sentence hearing he has to respond to what defendant presented he has to respond to what the government presented there is an obligation stemming from subpart to give reasons and thats what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence that the court of appeals has used reasons werent given for it 
 justice ginsburg i dont think there was anything problematic with what this district judge did as your honor noted this was a sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward departure the judge at least four times in this transcript brought up section N recognizing that the judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the purposes of sentencing and the factors that were presented to him now he did that and he made comments along the way that indicate why he did not find physical condition military service or asserted vulnerability in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this defendant a lower sentence and in his ultimate explanation though it is brief he pointed to two of the section N factors explicitly he pointed to the seriousness of the offense and he pointed to the need for public protection now if you look at the legal obligations that the judge had under section N to explain himself the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of three different levels of explanation first in any case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence second if the sentencing range is greater than N months the judge is supposed to explain the particular reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end of the range and finally if the sentence is outside the range the judge is to give the specific reason for a sentence outside the range that statutory framework makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge imposes a guideline sentence and explains i see no reason not to impose a guideline sentence he has met his burden of explanation without having to respond literally and in sequence to each argument that the defendant has made 
 may i ask this question the district judge is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard which i take it means theres a presumption he got it right is that correct theres a presumption the district judge sentence is correct 
 well justice stevens our position is more complicated than that because within a guidelines range if a sentence is imposed the government 
 why shouldnt there be also the same presumption when it is outside the guidelines range 
 because sentences that are outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a sentence within the range and that is why that if the court of appeals is interested in fulfilling what booker said the role of the court of appeals is which is to iron out sentencing differences there is more reason for the 
 well do you think the interest in uniformity in same sentences across the board is stronger than the interest in getting the correct sentence for the particular defendant whos in court at the time 
 well there isnt any one correct sentence usually 
 no there isnt but if you say the district judge has broad discretion which he does and the review is under abuse of discretion why should there not always be a presumption that the district judge got it right 
 because there are more legal elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review than just those that you have named justice stevens section N itself which is the guidepost for review mandates that the district court consider the guidelines consider the policy 
 yes but its sort of like findings of fact they must take into consideration all sorts of aspects of the case and you have a strong presumption that the findings of fact are accurate why dont you have a strong presumption that the ultimate judgment on the sentence is also accurate 
 what happens when a sentence is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater risk of infringing the main purpose of the sentencing reform act which was to avoid unwarranted disparities and in contrast to a sentence within the range which does not merely run that risk to the same degree a sentence outside the range may well its different from what the sentencing commission with its expertise and its experience has recommended as the appropriate sentence given those facts 
 well you are i mean this is a self fulfilling prophecy you are saying if you dont comply with the guidelines you are not going to have uniformity well i my goodness is that consistent with the notion that the guidelines are advisory 
 i wouldnt put it as strongly as that justice scalia what i would say is that the further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines range the greater the possibility of unwarranted disparity and as a result of that a court of appeals should look more critically at the reasons that the district court gave and ensure that the constellation of reasons and facts thats presented is not so likely to be a disproportionate sentence than 
 but thats just inconsistent with the notion which i think is correct that the district judge can simply disagree with the basic basic reasons of the commission can simply disagree with the fact that the commission considers white collar crime for example something that should justify incarceration 
 but justice scalia reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals will review the reasons that the district court gave for that disagreement 
 so doesnt your presumption argument come down to an argument for a sufficiently comprehensive statement of reasons with a more extensive statement required the further the court gets from the guidelines isnt that what it boils down to 
 it does for an out of range sentence justice souter i think that for a sentence within the range the judges statement that i have considered the guidelines range and i think its appropriate does explain why that judge has given the sentence that hes given its consistent with the statute and its consistent with the constitution now when 
 is there may i interrupt you because your time is getting short is there a difference between a presumption of reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and a rule that says the further you get from them you can get as far as you want to but the further you get from them the more extensive your explanation has to be is there a distinction between those two two rules 
 there is a distinction between them but i think they are complementary rules and in the next case the government will argue for a presumption that is precisely what you have articulated justice souter a greater and more extensive and more persuasive explanation is needed the further that you go from the guidelines range 
 or presumably the further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from the guidelines range if you have got a submission here N compelling reasons you shouldnt follow the guidelines and you get one sentence from the district court saying you know i followed the guidelines presumably that would be the same as a significant departure without further justification 
 it wouldnt be identical but i agree with you mr chief justice that a sentence within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a compelling case for a sentence outside the range because the guidelines simply dont fit in that circumstance the sentencing commission itself recognized that the guidelines were generalizations they carved out a heartland in the language of the sentencing commissions first set of guidelines and that there will be circumstances that would justify different sentences 
 is the system that you are describing any different for mandatory guidelines that are subject to departure when the district judge finds a significant reason which was what mandatory guidelines had 
 yes justice scalia it is quite 
 wherein is it different 
 it is different precisely on the area that that you yourself articulated the judge can disagree with the sentencing guidelines and determine that on the basis of the facts that the jury found the judge would impose a different sentence and that conclusion is then subject for reasonableness review and we submit based on a proportionality principle 
 thank you dreeben mr cochran you have three minutes remaining 
 that you mr chief justice i would like to return first to the across the board reasonableness review that this court established in booker that in and of itself shows why there cannot be a presumption of reasonableness on appeal because you are holding the presumption to a different standard at that point it is not a reasonableness across the board you are putting the burden on one the parties most likely the defendant to come forward and explain why the presumption should be rebutted that flies in the face with the across the board reasonableness this court set forth in booker the guidelines are fraught with disparity that why is they are advisory thats why they can only be advisory and the district courts must be allowed to look at them to see them to consider them but ultimately to impose a sentence outside them for valid reasons in mr ritas case the court didnt the court felt the guidelines held some undue weight it is indicated in the record in two places first and foremost on page N of the joint appendix where the court at the beginning of the sentencing hearing states other than the motion for downward departure that you submitted do you have any other objections and what im trying to do now is determine where your client fits within the sentencing guidelines clearly the judge was rooted in the guidelines and thats why he gave a sentence of N months at the low end 
 the the judge also pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he thought he was bound by them that is the defendant protested his independence and the jury had found him guilty of false statements 
 thats correct thats 
 the judge was bound by those 
 thats correct your honor but interestingly the court found very dubious the additional information regarding the crossreference and on page N of the joint appendix the court states it was not able to evaluate the seriousness of that other investigation and yet that was the crossreference that doubled his guidelines sentence we would ask the court to rule in this case that the presumption of reasonableness cannot be accorded to the guidelines 
 mr cochran you have started out by saying there were two places in the record that you thought showed the judge was bound by the guidelines N what was the other one 
 your honor the other one was page N 
 of the one oh that point okay 
 and that would be in the second paragraph mr chief justice where the court found it was unable to stray or found the guidelines were inappropriate and i suggest that that is a a giving of greater weight and too much so in this case your honor mr rita asks the court to find that a presumption cannot be accorded to the guidelines that his sentence was unreasonable in this case and that his case be returned for resentencing thank you 
 thank you mr cochran the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in case N long island care at home versus coke mr farr 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in the N amendments to the fair labor standards act congress made one thing very clear that it wanted the department of labor to define the boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship services exemption and i think that has two important implications for this case first of all when the department has filled in the details after notice and comment rulemaking its regulations should receive chevron deference as long as they are permissible implementation of the statute second and particularly specific to this case if there are ambiguities in the regulations or as we have here an apparent facial inconsistency the court should accept the secretarys resolution of that ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one and here we submit its not only a reasonable one it is by far the most sensible one now id actually like to turn if i may to the second issue first because i think thats the source of a lot of the concern in this case plainly the two regulations section N N which is the regulation directly at issue before this court and N which is the regulation relied on heavily by the second circuit to strike down the present regulation have some inconsistency between them but it is also plain that the department could not have intended to say at one and the same time that the only employers entitled use the exemption were homeowners and then say in another section promulgated at the same time that also thirdparty employers are entitled to the exemption so the question is how does one resolve this apparent inconsistency and the secretary says well the only regulation that we promulgated that in fact deals specifically with the issue of thirdparty employment is N which is in fact headed thirdparty employment and that section N while containing some language that might be read to address that issue in fact deals with several other topics specifically it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are involved in domestic service maids chauffeurs footmen et cetera where those have to be performed in a private home and in fact somewhat more than that in the private home of the person receiving the services so its not enough for example for somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby sitting in his or her own house it has to be in the house of the person receiving the services 
 i thought the words were home of the person who employs not who receives the services but who employs 
 oh thats correct justice ginsburg the literal language is not specifically what i was saying what im talking about is the secretarys attempt to resolve what is an apparent inconsistency between the literal language in N and the literal language of section N 
 by reading out the words of the person who employs her 
 well essentially reading them to say they they were not intended to address directly the subject of third party employment which is the subject addressed in N and i think if one is even leaving aside the question of deference to the secretary for a moment justice ginsburg if one is simply talking about making a fair resolution of these conflicting provisions from the ground up it seems to me the first thing that one would do is apply the canon that the specific provision controls the general and if one looks at the two provisions section N is a provision that deals with one thing and one thing only that is third party employment and it says explicitly and straight out that persons who are employed by thirdparty employers are or thirdparty employers who employ persons performing domestic services are entitled to the exemption 
 i thought it also addressed unlike the more general regulation just people who have companionship services so if you have a maid or a cook or a footman who doesnt provide companionship then N is inapplicable 
 that would be true now that would be inapplicable 
 whats a footman i dont even know what a footman is 
 what is a footman 
 i think that may be beyond my expertise justice scalia the of course that doesnt address anything beyond companionship services of course because there is not an exemption beyond that and thats one of the interesting things about N in addition to generally dealing with this question of what kind of jobs are domestic service it is in fact going well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion of the exemption for companionship services because jobs like chauffeurs and maids and all of that are not subject to the exemption so it really looking at what N is doing despite the couple of words that at the beginning of it is giving a general definition of what constitutes domestic employment what constitutes domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption but in fact really for the purposes of coverage as well and the department has taken that position it says this is in fact the only definition of domestic service that we have in the regulations and it is not just intended to be limited to the particular situation of the exemption it applies more broadly than that to coverage as well so i think in all those senses justice kennedy N is a very specific provision N deals with a number of other subjects now one other thing on the statutory interpretation part is that the reading of N that respondent offers also leads to the problem that essentially sets up a tension with another one of the regulations which is N N which im sorry i dont have the right page number here it is on page N a of the appendix to the petition has carries over the language from N about in the home of the employer that justice ginsburg referred to but then it also says that this includes people who are commonly referred to as private household workers and the one thing we know from the department of labor submissions to congress in N and also from what the department has said before this court is that that term at the time was defined by the department and known by congress to constitute more than just employees employed by the homeowner there was a special second category for people who worked in the home of the homeowner at the homeowners request but were employed by a third party agency now somewhere underlying all of this question i think is statutory interpretation and indeed all of respondents arguments against deference to the department is a basic underlying premise which is that congress really would not have wanted even if it didnt say so for the exemption to apply to employees who work for third parties and i would just like to suggest that there really is no basis for thinking that congress would have wanted that first of all third participate employers such as private agencies provide services for the particular group of people which congress was trying to assist with this exemption people who by reason of age or disability are unable to care for themselves agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the hiring they can do the vetting and the screening the background screening for employees they can provide necessary paperwork filing social security documents and things like that so in fact for congress to have some sort of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit unusual 
 mr farr im not sure i followed your argument with regard to N 
 uhhuh yes your honor 
 page N a as you said but what is your argument there i mean that seems to that seems to reinforce the provision that you say we should ignore or at least should accept the secretarys reinterpretation of 
 well perhaps perhaps i wasnt as clear as i intended to be it does as i indicated have the language about the private home of the employer 
 thats right 
 however the the preceding sentence says the term referring to the term that is at issue in N domestic service employment includes persons who are frequently referred to as private household workers the fact is that those two statements are inconsistent with each other the term cannot be limited to employees of the home owner and also include persons who are frequently referred to as private household workers at least if one means all the persons referred to 
 yeah i see is that clear in the in the specific senate report that is referred to here 
 in the specific senate report in both the N and the N reports 
 this the one thats cited in the regulation itself because i otherwise i dont i ignore those things thats cited in the regulation does that report say it 
 what the report uses the term private households workers frequently interchangeably with the term domestic employees that is what is clear from the report itself now the department of labor when it was reporting to congress as congress has required it to do the department of labor used the term private households workers specifically defined in there by the department to say this means not just employees employed by the homeowner but also people who are employed by third parties so i think it is a fair assumption that when the senate report was using that phrase it was using it in the same manner that the department of labor reports have and in fact at one point in the moving further backward in the legislative history senator dominick actually quoted that language the definition from the department of labor on the senate floor during the debates 
 i thought that the department of labors first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to thirdparty employers that was the original department of labor position wasnt it 
 no justice ginsburg i believe thats correct there was a an opinion letter from the department in november of N this is an opinion letter thats cited at page N of the solicitor generals brief which specifically stated that the exemption applied whether the employee was an employee of the homeowner or of a public or private 
 im referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock i thought the original notice and comment rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to thirdparty employers 
 im sorry justice ginsburg i misunderstood the time frame we were dealing with in the notice of proposed rulemaking actually i would disagree with that characterization also the notice of proposed rulemaking made a division among thirdparty employers it said the exemption would not be available to those thirdparty employers who were covered enterprises but it would be available to those who were not covered enterprises 
 well wait does the notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agencys position 
 no it does not 
 i didnt think it did they are just floating an idea you know 
 thats correct 
 run it up the flagpole see if 
 well that it solicited comments on that proposal and after the comments it changed its position to say no in fact all thirdparty employers will be exempt 
 and and there was no further discussion of it after after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt and then it said they will be exempt did it give reasons for the change 
 yes if i can just if i can quibble with the premise of the question the first time it said some thirdparty employers would be exempt and some wouldnt then when it changed 
 some would be the ones that qualified as what is the phrase enterprises engaged in commerce 
 thats correct those would be the ones under the proposed rulemaking that would have been denied the exemption when in fact when in fact the labor department said no in fact the exemption should apply to all thirdparty employers it said it found that more consistent with the statutory language and it also said it was more consistent with what it had done under other regulations which had been passed under the fair labor standards act 
 mr farr would you agree that the position expressed in the notice itself would have in the original notice would have been consistent with the statutory language 
 im not sure of that justice stevens to be honest with you i mean one of the difficulties here in answering that is that i think because the department has such broad authority under N to define and delimit the term i think whats consistent with the statute has expanded somewhat on the other hand i have to say i dont really see where there would be in the language of the statute any basis for drawing a distinction between different kinds of thirdparty employers the phraseology in the coverage provisions the phraseology in the exemption provisions really doesnt allow for that in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation 
 well there would be a basis in terms of the size of the thirdparty employers 
 i mean its possible but as i say the i mean among the difficulties that covered enterprises is not just corporations and big and small corporations covered enterprises beginning in N includes state and local governments so what congress would have been addressing here if it had been squarely facing the issue would have not just been the question of how to treat large and small corporations but whether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered enterprises such as state and local agencies who in fact do provide a lot of the direct employees who provide companionship care they have a lot of employees who actually go into homes and care for people who are employed by state and local governments and i think it would be a little bit unusual for congress who is reasonably solicitous of state interests to deny them an exemption that would have been of considerable importance to them as the state of or the city of new york brief points out this is a very extensive endeavor 
 were they covered before before there was any provision that dealt with household workers if state and localities were considered enterprises engaged in commerce then presumably they were they had no exemption before their companion care people just as household workers would be covered by the fair labor standards act 
 no but i think justice ginsburg the important point is they were not covered prior to N there were certain 
 they were not treated as covered enterprises 
 thats correct they were they were if they worked in schools or institutions like hospitals other than that they were not until N thats exactly correct this in fact would have been denying them an exception at the very time that for other occupations aside from companionship services they were first having coverage applied to them if there are no further questions id like to reserve the remainder of my time 
 thank you mr farr mr salmons 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the flsas companionship services exemption applies by its terms to any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for the aged or infirm the act imposes no limitation based on the identity of the employer and the agencys regulation of N extending the exception to employees of third parties is entitled to deference the department expressly invoked its statutory rulemaking authority in adopting section N N it utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking procedures both in N and each time it considered amending the regulation and states and care providers have relied upon it in devising systems to provide appropriate services to the aged and the infirm 
 so if the department of labor had enacted its regulations as originally proposed those regulations would have been invalid 
 no i dont think so your honor if you are referring to the initial proposed rulemaking that would have exempted only some third parties we think that would have been a permissible reading of the exemption given the fact that the secretary is provided very broad defined limit authority but we certainly think theres nothing in that exemption that precludes the construction thats been adopted here in fact we think it is the most consistent with that language the language of N upon which respondent relies does not change that conclusion while if read in isolation that language could require that domestic service employees have to provide their services in the home of the employer it should be not it should not be given that reading for the reasons explained in the departments N advisory memorandum the departments construction of its own regulations contained in that memorandum is itself entitled to deference under our and seminole rock and its construction harmonizes the various provisions at issue here far better than respondents reading of N does 
 the statute treats together babysitters and elder care people but i take it the babysitters if they were working for an agency rather than for the householders there wouldnt be any exemption is that right 
 thats correct and thats tied to a specific term that only applies to the exemption as to babysitters the only thing thats exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a casual basis congress certainly could have included a casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption for companionship services we think its very notable that it did not and we read from that that congress wanted all domestic service employees providing companionship services to be exempt and we think thats most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those individuals who most need this type of care have the opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost 
 isnt it odd that this the basic thing about the N legislation it was going to add to the fair labor standards act people who were not covered before so it added household workers and yet you say that while congress had its mind trained on adding people it also subtracted people who were covered before took them out removed them from the coverage of the act 
 well we think that that is the consequence of the companionship services exemption but we dont think thats odd based on the department of labors view of what the purpose of that exemption is and based on the textual difference between for example the exemption for baby sitting services and the exemption for companionship services the exemption here expresses no limitation based on the identity of the employer and we think it was well within the agencys discretion to conclude that what congress had in mind here was a categorical exemption based on the type of services that are being provided and while that may mean that there are certain workers who are now exempt who were not previously exempt thats because congress for the first time in N focused on this problem of companionship services being provided to those who cannot care for themselves and we think that follows from the text and for the reasons congress adopted that 
 mr salmons can i ask you a question about the importance of the whole litigation am i correct in believing that theres a provision in the law that protects the defendants from damages liability if they relied in good faith on the regulation so that what we are really talking about is whether the regulation would apply in the future rather than there being a damage issue in the case 
 well there is a safe harbor provision that allows for reliance by employers on a statement by the agency 
 that would clearly apply to this case would it not 
 we certainly think it would i take it respondents in this case would disagree and would point to the language of N im not sure for example how the second circuit would have resolved that question given the way it viewed the statute here but we do think that that would apply and so i think one view of that would be its largely prospective 
 so in your view we are really faced with a question of whether the regulation should be given prospective effect 
 im sorry what would be given prospective effect 
 as to whether the governments position should be given prospective effect because the past liability doesnt the damage liability just doesnt exist 
 well that is our view again i think that would be an issue that would be litigated and im sure litigated heavily in the hundreds of cases that are being filed under this provision and i think its one of the concerns i think of the agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the regulation are to be reconciled and applied 
 not seemingly conflicted they conflict 
 well i certainly dont take issue with that i think that there are a variety of things that point to the conclusion that the language in N that refers to in the home of the employer simply cannot be read literally it was borrowed from the social security context and if read the way respondents do we think would raise a serious question about the scope of coverage because the agency has always viewed N notwithstanding the initial line that says for purposes of the exemption to provide the relevant definition for coverage as well and no party or amici for that matter before this court nor the department thinks that theres a difference between the identity of the employer for purposes of coverage and we also think given the language in N that refers to private household workers the definition of which was provided to congress in a report by the department of labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum in N which clearly applies to third party employers suggests that N cannot be read literally and of course we know that at the same time that the agency adopted N it felt the need to adopt a specific regulation dealing with the question of thirdparty employment which would not be relevant which would not be necessary under respondents reading if the court has no further questions 
 thank you mr salmons mr becker 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court on october N N just five months after the N amendments to the fair labor standards act took effect the department of labor exercised its delegated lawmaking function to define this term domestic service employment which exists in the companionship exemption and nowhere else in the amendments and they defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to companions and baby sitters employed by the household at the same time dol provided a persuasive explanation for that definition the department found that such companions and baby sitters when employed by covered enterprises had been covered prior to the amendments and that it could not have been congress purpose when amendments were explicitly designed to extend coverage to at the same time contract coverage the very preamble to the act states that the purposes of the amendments are to expand the coverage of the act therefore the dol itself concluded in october of N that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny the acts protection to previously covered domestic service employees the definition in N which expressly applies only to the exemption conflicts directly with the final thirdparty regulation 
 was that later 
 yes your honor 
 how much later 
 the final regulations were promulgated in february of N 
 no no i thought that the provision that was what is the number where they say N that didnt appear anywhere until many years later 
 no no your honor that was in the final regulations which were promulgated in february excuse me in N not N 
 i mean you read 
 in the final regulations 
 you read N and N says what you said it says all right how much later did they promulgate N 
 that was in the final regulations in february of N 
 the same time that N was finally promulgated 
 thats correct 
 they came out together right 
 thats correct 
 thats what i thought so the same day they say N you have to have these domestic workers employed by the old lady whos sick and then in N they say you dont 
 thats correct theres a direct conflict 
 all right now why is that a conflict lets imagine it sounds like a conflict but its easy for me to imagine a regulation that says birds for purposes of this are animals that fly and then N pages later it says but by the way penguins dont and they are still covered i mean why is that a conflict there are lots of specific situations if i read that i would have thought well okay they have an exception 
 your honor the definitional regulation N explicitly defines a term used only in the companionship services exemption domestic service employment and it defines it clearly and explicitly to apply only to employment by the household therefore there is a direct conflict with the socalled third party employer regulation which appears to say that the exemption can apply to employees employed by third parties the importance of the conflict is twofold one when the original regulation was proposed the department provided a persuasive explanation congress surely didnt intend to contract coverage in amendments designed explicitly to expand coverage 
 did congress intend to cover which i guess is a growing situation that there is an old woman or man and they are very sick and they live in their house theres only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution their children hire a companion to look after them now thats a third party 
 your honor that question has been posed by some of the amici and it is a good question but not the question before you 
 because 
 and i submit that if the department construed section N to say when our words say employed by the household that could include a broader notion of the household for example a son or daughter living outside the household that might be a permissible construction of the departments own regulation but the construction which simply takes those words 
 it doesnt say that it says about in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed i live in san francisco my mother lives in massachusetts now if i hire a companion to live in massachusetts that companion does not work about a private home of the person me by whom she is employed so if we are being literal and if you win this case i dont see how and im worried about this obviously however and i think its probably very common that all over the country its the family the children the grandchildren an aunt an uncle maybe a good friend maybe they are not even related who is paying for a companion for an old sick person so they dont have to be brought to an institution and if you win this case it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and hence millions of sick people who will move to institutions now if i were to say that that isnt totally a legal point it is of course a legal point because its a question of what people intended but a worrisome point i would be telling the truth it is a very worrisome point 
 its a very important question of public policy and therefore let me answer in two ways one i think there is a proper procedure even under the existing regulations to address that concern the elderly individual that you are concerned about who is severely disabled and thus needs this care the child or family member who is employing the companion to care for them could do so as their guardian and therefore as a technical legal matter would be doing so the employment would be by the person who resides in the home 
 it wouldnt take a whole lot of imagination for justice breyer to give the money to his mother who could then hire 
 exactly 
 i mean a clever lawyer would think of that i think 
 a clever lawyer could do this 
 and perhaps there are people lawyers in the government who try to see through that kind of thing 
 but let me answer the second 
 and there are many maybe justice scalia has the answer 
 let me answer a second way to what is a serious concern and the second way the situation could be dealt with is by the department of labor they could look at their regulations and say the industry has changed and therefore in a way which could certainly be consistent with congresss intent because it would not be withdrawing coverage from a previously covered employee who was employed by an enterprise we could say that the exemption applies to companions and baby sitters employed by private individuals including the homeowner the son or daughter etcetera 
 you are saying its permissible to change the rules because the industry has changed is it not possible that the industry changed at about the time the statute was enacted that the prevalence of thirdparty employers is something that really developed later 
 as an empirical matter that is clearly the case justice stevens however we know several things about congress in N we know that the enterprise coverage was relatively new they adopted it in N expanded it in N and indeed expanded these very amendments in N so congress was aware of the prior coverage we know that the department of labor in the very reports which have been cited by the petitioner stated both in january of N and in january of N in their reports to congress on the act stated that there was prior coverage of domestics employed by third parties we know there was enforcement activity by the department of labor against such thirdparty employers so while the industry has certainly changed there were enterprises who employed domestics including companions in N and congress was aware of it and stated over and over again in the preamble in the committee reports which indeed the house committee report said our intention is to expand the act to the extent of federal power 
 how putting aside putting N aside how is N a plausible interpretation of the statute 
 your honor we think it is the most plausible interpretation for the following reasons number one contrary to what has been suggested the language in the exemption is not identical to the language in the extension provision extending the minimum wage and overtime requirements there is an important difference and that difference is the word employment now thats important for several reasons number one of course coverage provisions are to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly so theres an additional word that can and would suggest it should be read as a term of limitation number two that difference must be given significance if possible the word should not be read to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it doesnt exist in the coverage provisions and number three we should avoid redundancy there is a reading of that unique language domestic service employment which makes sense and in fact is exactly the reading given by the department congress did not intend to 
 what employment would someone whos hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment 
 the word domestic service employment is not necessary to describe what you described mr chief justice if that is what the congress intended to describe it could have said simply an employee employed to provide companionship services 
 well it could have said a lot of things but i find it you are hanging your case upon the proposition that there is a difference between domestic service employment and employed in domestic service employment wow you know i just dont see how theres any difference in those two at all 
 your honor 
 you are saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be if there were a difference im not sure its the difference that you are arguing for 
 what im suggesting is not that our case relies or hangs on that word what im suggesting is if that word that phrase domestic service employment is given the definition which the department of labor itself gave it it avoids reading two phrases which are different to mean the same thing it avoids redundancy and moreover it is wholly consistent with every other piece of evidence we have about congresss intent even the department of labor suggested it surely could not have been congresss intent to retract coverage the definition is consistent with that 
 can i ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations N and N what is it N i think they are contradictory now the agency has come up with a solution we will interpret the former quite unrealistically to mean something that it doesnt seem to us to say but you know close enough for government work what is your solution for solving the inconsistency are both of the regulations bad 
 my solution your honor has two parts but leads to the same conclusion our solution is that in applying the act which is the question here does the act apply to ms cokes employment this court should apply the definitional regulations for two reasons the definitional regulation for two reasons one it is the regulation which no one disputes and was promulgated in the exercise of the departments law making function the department expressly defined and delimited its term domestic service employment in N and expressly said it was not doing so in the thirdparty regulation so its entitled to greater deference for that reason but moreover 
 whats your other reason 
 it is the only definition which makes sense which doesnt lead to a whole series of problems 
 because of employed and domestic employment versus 
 for 
 domestic service 
 for the following five reasons your honor one it avoids reading a term in the statute not only a term in the regulation but a term in the statute completely out of the statute and that is the term employment secondly as the department found it is consistent with what was congresss clear intent to expand and not to contract coverage thirdly if one looks at the debates and there was extensive and vigorous debate about these amendments the exclusive focus in congress was the household the opponents were exclusively concerned with the extension of coverage to the households so applying the exemption to protect only household employees is wholly consistent with what was congresss exclusive 
 well you are getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they are about the statute im assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference and you have two regulations that are conflicting now how do you decide which one prevails counsel for the other side says the specific governs the general certainly an ancient prescription counsel also says that this is an agency regulation the agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations and even if the agency had said well you know they do conflict we admit it they totally conflict we wont even try to reinterpret N we think thats the one thats wrong why wouldnt we accept their statement to that effect 
 your honor of course setting aside as you do our argument that congress has specific intent on this question looking only at the regulation 
 thats statutory i just want to focus on the regulation arguments not the statutory 
 let me answer in several ways first this court has clearly held that an agency does not have unbounded discretion to construe its own regulations when the terms of the regulations are unambiguous they cannot be construed away now here 
 they arent unambiguous they contradict each other the agency has to do something about it and here the agency made a choice even if i assume the choice was we are going to disregard N we are going to strike out those words they were the mistake one or the other had to be the mistake we decided it was this one why shouldnt we take their word on it 
 again for two reasons your honor theres a difference between conflict and ambiguity the words are unambiguous and its not simply the theres two sets of words which they attempt to read out of the regulation one of the unambiguous words that require employment by the person whos living in the home and the other is the prefatory language which says the regulation only applies to the exemption so in the guise of deference the solicitor general and the petitioners actually suggest to this court that it should take apart the regulation and ignore two of its three operative provisions 
 but if they are flatly contradictory doesnt your argument have to be that N has lesser status thats what it boils down to isnt it 
 that is certainly my primary argument that this statute is relatively unique in that it vested two very different sorts of authority in the department of labor one a clear law making authority to actually define and delimit to specify what the terms in the law mean 
 im talking about what you think the department of labor was doing when it promulgated N it was thinking in effect the following we have the power to issue a regulation here that has the force and effect of law and we are going to go through the procedure that would be necessary to issue such a regulation but we are not invoking that power here because we want this interpretation which we think is the correct interpretation of the statute not to be followed not to get as much deference from the courts as it would if we were invoking our power does that make any sense that an agency would proceed in that way 
 your honor it not only makes sense its been the departments pattern since the act was adopted that is the department since the act was adopted has split its regulations into those under the exemptions for example the primary exemption for professional executive and administrative employees has split its regulations under those exemptions into those which define and delimit into those which do not define and delimit or other general statements that apply to their interpretation 
 yeah but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to chevron deference at least if they are adopted by notice and comment rulemaking you know we have nothing what should i say subordinate about interpretive regulations in fact probably most of the significant regulations of the most important agencies are interpretive regulations 
 the important difference here justice scalia is the statute the statute like the tax statute which was interpreted by this court in vogel and rowan creates two types of authority and not only under the fair labor standards act but 
 i understand that you say it creates two types but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other what do you rely on for that 
 your honor 
 where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a fullfledged binding regulation 
 well let me qualify the question if i might the petitioner would suggest that we are relying on simply a label this is in the interpretive section and the other is in the general regulation section far from it we are relying on a very clear statement both in the regulations N as well as in both the proposed regulations and the final regulations which clearly state that only those in part a define and delimit why is that an important distinction its an important distinction because congress clearly meant these two grants to be different otherwise why would it have granted an express power to define and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of the general rulemaking authority 
 they are different but not necessarily of different entitled to different respect from the courts a defined what is it define and delimit these are regulations that dont even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas to say the this rule wont apply to companies over this that cant possibly be an interpretation of the statute so congress says we are going to give the agency that authority in addition of course we are going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has which is to interpret interpret the language of the statute 
 well your honor i think we can safely assume in N when congress created these two types of authority it did so with knowledge of the law and this court if you compare its decision in addison to its decision in skidmore clearly itself distinguished between the exercise of those two different interpretive or rulemaking authority clearly in addison construing a very similar term in a different exemption giving the department of labor the power to define a particular term in the exemption said that is law making authority and we will follow what the department of labor says unless its clearly inconsistent with the statutory with congresss intent in skidmore where that type of expressed delegated law making authority to define and delimit was not at issue the court said we will record only that degree of deference to which the regulation 
 skidmore was before a rather significant case called chevron 
 absolutely your honor but it was also before the N amendment so if the question is what was congress intending in creating two types of rulemaking authority the power to define and delimit and the general rulemaking authority i think we need to consider congresss intent at that time 
 you mean we are going to divide all administrative law now into those those regulations those provisions that were adopted by congress prechevron and those adopted by congress postchevron and for the ones adopted prechevron we are going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give skidmore deference to and the ones after chevron we are going to treat differently do you have any case of ours that suggests something like that which seems to me a very strange manner of proceeding 
 let me answer in two ways your honor one it would not be any case here we have a particular statutory scheme that is contrary to 
 ought not to get as much deference from the courts 
 here we have a case essentially described by justice kennedy in and haga where we have a different statutory scheme combined with a explicit statement by the agency as to which part of that scheme the agency is operating under but the case i would cite or the cases would be rolo and rove which have not 
 since we are into that we are into this fascinating subject i thought that possibly they had they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute because thats what it says in N it says this part it doesnt say subpart it says part and part is N and both regs we are talking about are in the part and b says interpretations but they dont mean interpretive rules because when you look at those interpretations they have a whole lot of numbers in them and divide by N nobody thinks that congress meant in this statute divide by N as opposed by divide by N so as i read that i thought the whole thing is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority part a has more general things part b has more specific things where am i wrong 
 well i think the question your honor is which of the regulations were promulgated pursuant to the specific authority 
 all of them all of them is what it says unless i missed something 
 well i think what you missed is that a simple citation to the exemption does not translate into an exercise of the power to define and delimit because the department was very very specific as to when it was exercising that power in N it says the definitions required by the legislation are provided in the following sections and it enumerates them and does not include the thirdparty regulation now petitioners would suggest well thats just a definition they also have the power to delimit however both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the notice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising our power to define and delimit in subpart a 
 okay i got the point 
 but part b is different 
 right right 
 so why are you sure theres a conflict in the first place you know N says that the term domestic service employment refers to services performed in the home of the employer it doesnt say it only refers to that and then you go down and N says it also includes employees who are employed by a third party i mean cant they be reconciled in that way 
 i dont think so your honor and its certainly not the way that the 
 its not the way the agency has done it but you dont think we should defer to them anyway so 
 thats correct but the regulation N defines the statutory term which only exists in the exemption domestic service employment 
 yeah but it says it refers to something it doesnt say as many of these regulations and statutes do is you know it is defined as and particularly when you are confronted with what would otherwise be a conflict maybe refers to should be read to mean includes rather than is defined as 
 well i think we have to read the definitional regulations together that is all of the terms in the exemption companionship services babysitting services casual basis domestic service employment are all defined in the set of regulations point N point N point N point N and it is clear from the prefatory language of each one that what the department of labor intended to do was define the terms in the statute and so when it said that that term refers to 
 well it is interesting when you look at i mean they are its a good point its interesting when you look at the other definitions the babysitting it says this provision shall mean here it just says it refers to lets see the other ones casual basis shall mean companionship services shall mean this one doesnt say shall mean it says it refers to this im just wondering if thats something that suggests its not intended to be as exclusive as the other definitions 
 i do not believe so your honor it is an exercise of the power to define the term and i dont think we can take that language refers to to be nonexclusive when the department said referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it was if we have any doubt about what the department intended it actually of course reiterated that definition under the interpretive classification and it again said that the term refers to is defined as employment by the household if we had any doubt 
 mr becker 
 there it says there it says includes and if you are talking about N there it says the term includes persons frequently referred to as private household workers 
 im referring to an earlier provision of the same regulation not the reference to private household workers but where it states that the definition includes those individuals who are employed by the household that is in N but if we had any further doubt the that regulation refers to as its source of the language the regulation adopted under the social security act now N cfr N it was originally numbered differently but at the time in N that regulation which was explicitly the source of the language the department of labor used said not once not twice but three times that the individual had to be employed by the household 
 mr mr becker if there is room for the agency to read this statute either way one way that the third party employee would come under the fair labor standards act the other that they would not would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself but if the concern of congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds if the agency is subject to the fair labor standards act its going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway so why isnt the most reasonable interpretation of what congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board so that all workers in this category would be exempt 
 your honor setting aside of course all the reasons about congresss intent in N which we have already explained we would not say that that there is any credible evidence in the legislative history or the text of the act to suggest that cost was a factor and let me explain why the department for the first time when it promulgated its advisory memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third party regulation it said nothing of the sort in N as support for the assertion it cited four isolated comments in the legislative history none of them except the last and there is only one of them related in any way to the exemption the one that related to the exemption in fact directly supports our position because it describes those people who are not within the exemption as the professional domestics so we dont think that theres any basis for suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale and in fact it is really implausible because at the same time for example congress extended the provisions of the act which covered nursing homes at the same time as has been pointed out congress only exempted casual babysitters now we would submit that if congress was concerned about cost in creating this babysitter and companionship exemption the primary intended beneficiaries of that would have been working families where both people worked and therefore who require a fulltime baby sitter 
 thank you counsel 
 and a fulltime baby is not covered thank you very much 
 mr farr you have three minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice respondent in response to justice scalias question about how respondent would reconcile the regulation N and N actually did not i believe attempt any reconciliation if i understand respondents position correctly its simply N has to be invalidated dated and N stands in its entirety i think thats incorrect for several reasons first of all the basis for it is essentially this apparent distinction between the define and delimit authority and the more general authority to enact necessary rules and regulation but in fact as justice breyer pointed out in his question both grants of authority were invoked by the department when it enacted both regulations simultaneously not limited to either subpart a or subpart b and for the reasons that justice alito points out it is a very odd thing to attribute to the department to say that it would exercise two different legislative powers in different parts of the of the regulations theres no reason it would do that the subpart b regulations clearly are regulations that delimit the terms of the exemption in N theres no question about that so why in fact if it was doing what congress authorized it to do under N would it instead of relying on the grant of authority in that provision rely on some other general grant of authority it makes no logical sense to attribute that to the department and it seems to me in excuse me in fact that that argument points up one of the difficulties here it seems to me that the arguments here are a way of simply trying to push the department aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job of exposition on this exemption not only contrary to the basic principle of chevron which is where that where is ambiguity in the statute or room for interpretation the agencies are given the opportunity to do that within reasonable bounds it is also contrary to the statute it is clear as i said at the beginning of my argument the department was the agency chosen by congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the exception now id like to say just one other thing in response to justice stevens question about the particular nature of the litigation this is a suit for damages it is a suit claiming will damages thank you your honor 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in N safeco insurance company versus burr and N geico general insurance company versus edo ms mahoney 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court id like to turn first to the ninth circuits interpretation of the term willfully and its determination that the case had to be remanded for further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore petitioners communications with their counsel we ask this court to find that there is no necessity for any such inquiry for waivers of attorneyclient privilege because summary judgment should have been affirmed in this case petitioners and their counsel if you think about what communications you might find they could not have known anything more about these statutory issues of first impression than the district court did its questions of law and if the district courts opinion does not reflect reckless disregard for the law for the reading of the statute then it would be inappropriate to characterize petitioners adoption of the very same views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the of the fcra the first the ninth circuit nevertheless reached a contrary conclusion and said it was time to go ahead and look at privileged communications if the petitioners wanted to defend the case because they made selfinterpretive errors about the meaning of willfully and the first is that they read willfully in this setting to mean recklessly and relied on several cases where this court has read the term willfully in civil statutes to mean recklessly but this court has said repeatedly that the word willfully is contextual that you have to look at all of the sections of the statute to see how its used to determine whether it means with knowledge that your conduct violates the law or whether reckless violations are sufficient and in this particular statute unlike the other three that were at issue congress has used the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean as plaintiffs concede that the defendant knows that their conduct violates the act 
 well its also used in the phrase knowing and willfully that appears in several other parts of the statute and that wouldnt make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing 
 well it actually says willfully and knowingly 
 in one formulation or another but it combines the two words knowing and willful 
 well this court though has held that willfully and knowingly when that phrase is used together its been discussed in a number of cases including dixon recently that it means willfully means knowledge that the conduct violates the law and knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts and that would make perfect sense in this setting and so the term willfully when again used 
 you mean willfully alone 
 it 
 where where it where it means what you think it means which is knowingly that does not mean knowing the facts if you mistake the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the facts you have nonetheless willfully violated the law 
 your honor in ratzlaf the phrase was willfully not willfully and knowingly and the court held that it meant that you knew that your conduct violated the law and that seems to be the most reasonable reading here because if you look there are also sections of section N n that refer to knowing conduct and that would require the conclusion that congress used willfully in this section to mean a a less a more a less culpable mens rea than knowingly and thats 
 so that if you are the ceo of your company and a lawyer federal counsel comes in and says we have got a real issue under the fair credit reporting act i need to brief you on that we need to make an important decision about whether we are complying you say i dont want to hear about it i dont want to know about it that would not be willfully violating the statute 
 well under some cases have suggested that there could be a willful blindness instruction that would govern whether you define that as knowing or not certainly 
 so it doesnt have to be actual knowledge 
 i think that the best reading of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is that is everything but you know that really is 
 how about reckless disregard 
 well conscious disregard is a recklessness standard and even if the ninth circuit correctly determined that this should be interpreted as a recklessness standard this court has defined recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious disregard actual knowledge of a high risk of of of harm or in this case illegality and in these circumstances you cant say that there was a high risk of illegality because what the district court found is that the petitioners interpretations of the statute were actually not only reasonable but correct and having 
 since the term knowingly or knowing appears in two places in N n cant we infer from that that willfully in that provision also means something different 
 i think the way its used it says knowing knowingly that they did not have a permissible purpose permissible purpose that may not be knowledge of the law it just may be knowledge that your purpose wasnt permissible and even if they were using it 
 i thought the statute says what the permissible purposes are 
 it does but it doesnt necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what the statute said because for instance users are told what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit report from from a credit agency but more importantly your honor i think that the use of the term knowingly there can also be explained if you look at section N h it actually provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless there is a willful intent to injure except as provided in section N n and they are the same kinds of actions that are carved out in N n and so i think it was to make clear i think it was to make clear that you didnt have to have a willful intent to injure so even if they meant it to be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law there i think there was a reason for it it wasnt just surplusage it was to clarify that they didnt have to have a willful intent to violate 
 would you say its all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless which is basically what you taking it here you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful 
 thats correct your honor 
 if you come across anything that would use that i mean reckless itself is unclear the model penal code tried to clarify it based on this courts opinions primarily 
 but i think you can look to the way this court described recklessness in farmer vs brennan as well though as well as 
 whats the difference 
 the difference is just there is two forms of recklessness one which says that if the risk is sufficiently high if a person should have known you could be you could be liable but that the form of recklessness that congress presumably used here in this setting where there is the potential for very punitive sanctions was what is referred to farmer versus brennan calls it criminal the criminal recklessness standard and that means that not only do you have to have an objectively high risk of illegality but you must be actually conscious of that risk but in this case you dont even need to get to the issue of consciousness 
 well you said there is no way they couldnt have been conscious of the risk here i mean after all thats why they went to lawyers they know theres risk that this is unlawful 
 the question is 
 but consciousness i mean maybe it should come in in the standard but i dont know that that would help you 
 i think the issue of conscious the risk though it has to be a high risk and if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute or even if it is an interpretation of the statute that is fairly debatable that you have a fair chance of success then how can you say that is a high risk of illegality so high that we should say that congress wanted to sanction you for taking that position and for saying that you know you shouldnt be permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was a fair ground for believing that it was lawful and here what the ninth circuit did 
 suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful lawyers are in disagreement but in fact i believe the lawyers who say it is unlawful and i nonetheless go ahead and do it is that a willful violation 
 i dont i dont think so your honor if in fact it was a fair ground for 
 but i think im violating 
 i dont yes but you couldnt know you were violating it and because if it really is a fair ground for litigation 
 im a better lawyer than my advisors 
 your honor i think if its an area where the law is truly unsettled and here an issue of first impression a lawyers assessment that you may lose is inherently predictive these are not true or false answers when there is almost nothing to go on and so in that area its much like what this court did in screws where it said that this was a case involving a willful violation of or interference with rights secured by by federal law and what the court says well its not just any bad purpose that congress had in mind it is a bad purpose to defy announced rules of law they have to be there has to be sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a high risk of illegality that you could disregard 
 would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all 
 only 
 or would you just look to the outcome and say well you know it was a close question so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation it was a close question its okay 
 i dont think you would look at the intent until you found that there there was no reasonable ground or at least no no no fair ground for debate about the question and at that point your honor if there was an objectively high risk of illegality then you do have to ask what were they consciously aware of what did they do 
 i must say that that is not the normal meaning of willful willfully violating the law 
 well i think in screws 
 you are changing it to mean willfully willfully and blatantly violating the law 
 i dont think so 
 i mean if i know that what im doing is in violation of the law even if its a close question it seems to me i am willfully violating the law 
 your honor screws says you cant know the unknowable and if the law if its really truly an issue of first impression you may think you are violating the law but you you cant know the unknowable and thats why this setting is so important because you cant you know put impose sanctions here we are talking about the potential for an industry facing billions of dollars without any actual harm to to individuals and that 
 is it really billions how many of these have been certified as class actions 
 i believe that there are two certified class actions but many there are many cases pending and it could be billions of dollars your honor certainly if the classes are certified and 
 would you would you as representative of the insurers would you have a sound objection to class action certification in these cases 
 your honor im sure there would be some bases to resist but classes have been certified so i 
 and gone to gone to judgment 
 i do not believe any have gone to judgment but i dont i dont i think that the point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every consumer who didnt get a notice simply because they may have gotten a better price if they had even better credit across the country if you interpret the statute that way and then you can say you can get this thousand dollar what is in essence a penalty and you multiply that by the number of consumers then you certainly have the potential for very very substantial liability 
 its a question how many will sue for a thousand dollars given the litigation costs 
 well given that these are proceeding as class actions the answer is there is plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs attorneys to bring these class actions and they have been brought and this is a class action there are two class actions 
 they havent neither has been certified has it 
 no it has not they are putative class actions your honor but i but i think that whether its a class action or not we have to look at what did what did congress presumably have in mind when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive damages based on a willful violation in a technical area where there is no potential for harm and certainly 
 i have just two two questions on on willful and then because you may want to talk about the other issue in the case first you began by saying that here a district judge has come to the contrary conclusion by definition it cant be reckless do you have any authority where we for that proposition where we have said that 
 well 
 we find all the time that a right is not clearly established under aedpa and so forth and disregard what i just said thats my first question and the second is willfully as screws itself makes very clear it is interpreted differently in the criminal context than it is in the civil context 
 except screws your honor actually says that it was adopting a criminal recklessness standard not a knowing standard but a reckless standard and that is the same standard that has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully in the punitive damages context so i think its exactly the same standard in that screws does say that the you cant have it cant just be a bad purpose that it has to have been a bad purpose to violate clearly defined rules and this court has said in various contexts in the in the qualified immunity area that picking the losing side does not mean that your conduct was objectively you know wrongful and thats really i think that there is great significance to the district courts ruling im not saying that in every case it would absolutely be dispositive i think you have to look at what was the you know the clarity of the law what was the reasoning of the district court but what the ninth circuit did is that it in essence said that you cant rely on creative but unlikely answers to issues of first impression well if an administration official goes to a lawyer in the administration and asks about a course of conduct and is told well its completely an issue of first impression there is probably a N percent chance of success do you say its reckless to proceed on that basis 
 well just because an issue is one of first impression doesnt mean theres a high degree of uncertainty the statute may be clearly addressed to that issue it hasnt come up before 
 absolutely your honor 
 first impression 
 it certainly this court has made clear that if the language of the statute is very plain then of course that can be noticed that can be adequate warning but certainly this statute doesnt satisfy that standard congress didnt provide the benchmarks that you have to use for comparison to determine whether there has been an increase in a charge or whether there has been an adverse action based on the consumer report you need benchmarks to answer those questions and there arent any regulations and there were no cases if i could save the balance of my time for rebuttal 
 thank you counsel ms millett 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the court of appeals correctly concluded that willfulness in the civil context as is used here includes a reckless disregard component or a recklessness component that is what this court has held in a number of cases that have similar uses of willfulness focused on a departure from the law have held thurston richland shoe and hazen paper are the three that have been most discussed in the case in the papers here but where the ninth circuit misstepped here was in the application of that standard and in particular we agreed with petitioners that when it concluded that a creative but unlikely position constitutes recklessness it erred recklessness speaks an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care it requires that the defendant act in the face of or fail to act 
 it is a subjective standard or an objective standard 
 it has both in this context it is i think first and foremost an objective component because there is this is a civil case its not purely subjective and that objective component is very important because that is what makes the act or inaction reckless and that is the risk there has to be an objectively high and obvious risk 
 so if the potential liability as in these cases is huge then you have to be even more careful because there is liability so great so is it the greater the liability the greater chance of recklessness the greater the potential liability 
 no to the extent you are talking about dollar liability i dont think thats true i do think its fair to say that in recklessness generally in the tort law the more serious an injury that could result can we will tolerate less risk if the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to somebody we will the law will tolerate a lesser degree of risk than it will if if its simply causing you know a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or maybe even a dollar injury and its not set its a variable calculation so in that sense it is i dont think that when we talk about a high and objective risk in this context we are talking about the dollars that a that a company would have to pay although im sure they are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers what we are talking about here and this is a very unusual statute the way its written the liability itself not just the damages but the liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from law you have to there is no recovery here like there is in almost or commonly in federal statutes for just a violation that isnt it you have to show either a willful violation or a negligent violation and that requires a determination not only that the defendants violated the law but a determination as to how much how far how many standard deviations from correct their position was and that is an objective determination once an objectively high risk has been found by a court then then the case can shift to looking into subjective things i think a plaintiff would be entitled once an objectively high and obvious risk has been found by the court to rely on that and allow a jury to or a judge whoever is deciding the case to infer the existence of willfulness from that and thats often when defendants im sorry 
 may i also ask do you agree with the petitioner on the meaning of adverse action 
 no we agree with respondents on the meaning of adverse action 
 correct me if im wrong you think if i have an insurance policy im paying a certain rate they look at my credit report and they say you know good news we are going to lower your rates thats an adverse action because they might have lowered the rates even further if they had notified me about the credit report and there were some errors in it 
 right its a complicated answer in part because that assumes that you have an existing account and you are not an initial account here and when you have an existing account theres a definition of adverse action for insurance provisions but in iv there is a separate theres another definition and this is on on page sorry excuse me on page N a of the appendix to our brief iv under big i im sorry theres a lot of provisions talks about reviewing an existing account and it crossreferenced another provision which talks about reviewing an account for purposes of termination and that would include in our view not only completely canceling it but terminating the existing and charging you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate so which would govern in that particular context is a little bit harder but it could and heres logically why because i think the understanding of increase thats at issue here is one thats very basic to the operation of this statute and that is did the content of your information in your credit report if it had been better could you have had a better rate or a better deal 
 right 
 so have you been hit in the pocketbook 
 so if they lower if they lower the rates you still say that that fits the meaning of adverse action because they might have lowered them further if the information hadnt been erroneous 
 it could have and here in this sense it could be in the same way that i sort of the flip side but in my office if everybody in the hallway gets a N percent salary increase and i only get a N percent salary increase i am certainly better off but if the reason i got a lesser increase is because of my gender or because of my credit report its an adverse action so the fact that you are doing somewhat better doesnt mean 
 that isnt how the statute defines it 
 excuse me 
 the statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for in connection with underwriting 
 but it also 
 thats what it says and then it says an increase is and if you take an adverse action ie if you increase it and your increase is based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report you have to send the thing how did you get in your example there was no increase i mean in a charge in your salary its a decrease in the salary same thing 
 the definition again on N a includes not just increase but includes an unfavorable change in the terms and so its not settled whether 
 you mean unfavorable change in terms unfavorable change in terms 
 exactly 
 well suppose you dont have you dont have any terms because you never did it before theres no change in terms 
 if you are a new customer and again i want to reiterate that how this applies to existing accounts is complicated 
 you mean those words change in terms refer to rates in other words thats a rather odd way to refer to it in one place you refer to an increase in the other place youd refer to it as a change in terms thats sort of an odd way to write a statute 
 well you can have a change in terms that is not necessarily an increase it could be you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when your car is in for repair for some reason thats not an increase 
 no no i understand that but what we are after is this everybody has a credit report just about you put it in and you give people the best possible rate conceivable and now how do you know that maybe there could have still been a better rate and it cant be that the statute intends you to send out notices in such circumstances or youd have to send notices whenever you read a credit report now i think thats i have overstated slightly but thats basically the argument so whats your response 
 and justice breyer my response is that if the content of the information in your credit report would have made you had it been better information youd have gotten a better rate a better result your pocketbook wouldnt have been hit as hard you have a dollars and cents injury because of the content of the information then you had an adverse action 
 okay so your response is just to repeat my question and say thats right 
 no if i could continue on that if i could add on if i could add on the way insurance companies work is they dont have N million customers and N million rates they have ranges and most of them will have a top tier they may have specialized things for employees but putting aside a specialized category theres a top range and they will tell you as they say in the briefs that N to N percent of people fit in there so they know what the best rate is they know what the next above average rate the standard rate 
 how do you fit how do you fit that within the language of the statute is it i fail you are a first time customer and i fail to give you a you know a break that maybe you could have had is it a denial or cancellation of insurance no is it an increase in an increase in any charge for insurance is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any insurance i find it hard to shoehorn your case into that language 
 well to begin with that may be why petitioners position here certainly was not reckless and the ninth circuit erred but we do think that the statutory language read as a whole supports this it could be a denial of a particular term in an insurance contract but you have to look at its important to understand you look 
 i read the term as as one of the justices here does not referring to the rate the earlier part refers to the rate an increase in any charge for thats the rate and then it speaks of change in the terms of coverage i mean that is you know whether it covers hurricanes or in the amount of the insurance whether you are insured for 
 or it could be a reduction in the terms i mean these things are statutory construction issues to be litigated and the important issue here and they are presented in this case they are to be litigated and the important issue is that when there is fair debate about these issues insurance companies will not be held to be willfully violating the statute if they got the answer wrong but i think on the on the substantive question its important to read adverse action in light of if i could just finish the sentence in light of the definition of when a notice is required to be issued which turns upon the content of the information in the report thank you 
 which is where 
 and thats on page N a on our appendix 
 thank you 
 thank you counsel mr shorr 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court when congress intended to require a knowing violation of the fair credit reporting act it expressly said so it did not do so in connection with the claims here under section N n in each instance where congress wanted to allow to require a higher mens rea it said so and did so in connection with liability that was greater they required knowing mens rea for the criminal provision they required knowing mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages that are available under the act 
 what do you say to the argument from drafting history that looks at the history both of little n and little o and it points out that as originally in the original bill little o providing for the actual damages required a finding of gross negligence little n used the word willful just as it does now suggesting that willful would not include gross negligence or something close to gross negligence like recklessness then in then in o they changed the standard from gross negligence to mere negligence but they made no change in n which suggests that n stayed whatever it always was and if the argument from contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than reckless it stayed knowing even when the standard was changed to negligence in o what do you say to that argument 
 justice souther i think the only thing we can say about that is congress reduced the culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence to negligence i dont think that tells us much about willful means what willful means as a separate matter 
 but the fact that they had originally drafted n as it is in contrast to the original o does tell us doesnt it something about what they had in mind in n and they must have had something in mind probably had in mind something in n which was a standard higher than gross negligence 
 no justice souter i suggest that what you can infer from that is that if anything is perhaps congress wanted to move make clear that under o the actual damages arent close to willful or reckless so they reduced gross negligence to negligence in that circumstance but that still doesnt tell us separately what willful meant and of course willful had been interpreted by this court in similar cases involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless disregard and i respectfully disagree with 
 well i mean theres no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context but we also keep repeating you know willful is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context and here the argument is that if you look to the context of the of the two statutory sections right up next to each other you can draw a an inference about what willful means 
 i think if anything justice souter here the context should be the actual statutory terms used and in section N n they expressly required the knowing standard and thats a knowing violation of the law as justice alitos question seemed to draw out a knowing impermissible purpose and the statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is under this law so that reference to knowing could not refer to a knowing knowing the facts and of course willful in some sense always includes some knowledge of the factual circumstances in addition the logical structure of the act as i mentioned we had negligence and actual damages we have a reckless standard a knowing or reckless standard for certain statutory damages but then an even higher level for the criminal and higher statutory penalty provisions and as i started to say a willful knowing reckless standard is entirely consistent with how this court has interpreted the term in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about the same time the hazen paper case and thurston and mclaughlin cases interpreting the ada and the flsa and other similar cases 
 counsel even if you are right about the standard how can you suggest that its willful here when you have no judicial construction you have no administrative construction you have the statutory language that at least the questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly clear how can you suggest that the action of the companies on this case even under your standard was willful 
 mr chief justice of course we believe and the statute is in fact clear you do not need further interpretation by the court 
 so if we dont agree with you on that you would lose on the application of the willfulness standard 
 if you dont agree with us 
 in other words your your your conclusion that this was a willful violation depends upon your assertion that the statute is perfectly clear 
 i think that there is a level of objective component that the statute at least has to be understood by a reasonable person at some level using standard statutory construction but that isnt to suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a higher court or even a district court for counsel to get guidance and of course in this case there was no guidance supporting respondents excuse me no guidance supporting petitioners defendants position in fact the only guidance supported our position including guidance from the ftc 
 you are talking about the ball letter 
 i am talking about the ball letter 
 that wasnt even binding on the commission so why would that be regarded as authoritative 
 it was not and we are not suggesting it is although its entitled to chevron deference but if you get past the minimal level of objective standard the question becomes what indicia and markers were out there that would have guided this company as to whether there was a high risk that they were violating the act and certainly the ball letter which was sent by the staff specifically to address this exact question and to guide insurance companies gave notice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than the best available rate based on their credit score was an adverse action and in addition there was 
 well how could that be i mean i agree that the statute is clear but i think its clear the other way that is if you look at the language as you have just heard if you look at the purpose its very hard to reconcile with the purpose an instance where a person has continuous accidents hes a reckless driver his insurance company puts him in just a category below the bottom and they read his credit report and they discover despite his faults he always pays his bills on time so they increase it not to the top category but they give him a much better deal and you are saying this statute means that what i just described is an adverse action based on a credit report 
 yes 
 yes okay and then if you are going to say yes i want to hear why yes and then in light of the following the little boy who says wolf you are probably puzzled what i mean by that i mean that if you are right in that interpretation there will be tens of millions of notices going out and they will have the same effect on the public that these privacy notices have today we get them every day dozens of them and they go right in the wastebasket because they will become meaningless because to an average person that notice will not mean that he better look at his credit report it will mean throw it in the wastebasket all right now i have got the purpose i have got the language and i have what i think of as common sense now you explain why its obvious the opposite 
 this is a different question we have been talking about willful up to now 
 yes and this is the adverse action question 
 you havent addressed adverse action at all 
 and im happy to do so now 
 yes but was there anything further on willful you said that the statute was clear enough and you had the ftc informal advice but now we know that courts have divided on this question right on 
 divided in the sense well the ninth circuit of course overturned the district courts ruling so theres no current division but if thats what you mean yes your honor in a i guess i will address quickly your question theres additional guidance provided by the ftc that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was N cfr i believe its part N appendix c and in that instance the ftc again subject to formal notice and comment of rulemaking said that the statute is defined very broadly and it includes any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact and that plays in the subjective aspect as well but addressing your question justice breyer first on the statutory language 
 its pretty sloppy lawyering dont you think any action that even be considered to have wow this is a standard 
 that was 
 any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact 
 that was guidance your honor 
 this is guidance 
 that was guidance that was guidance to provide in the context of reading this statute it should be read broadly 
 but you know i would tell my ceo ignore that that its meaningless 
 in addition the ceo would have the guidance provided by the ball letter but again addressing your question justice breyer an increase based on credit if we had lets say an increase based on race someone goes in and has a product to buy and theres the best rate and they charge someone else based on their race a higher rate certainly thats an increase based on credit theres only one best rate 
 but this is not an antidiscrimination provision it doesnt say anyone who discriminates in the setting of race has to send out letters it requires an adverse action it requires an increase in the charge 
 and your honor i was only using that example to try and explain the statutory language 
 it doesnt explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race of course thats an increase based on race 
 well here we have 
 and if you refuse to give a person the best rate and lower his rate but not the best rate based on race that is not an increase based on race that is discrimination based on race 
 you are charging someone more based on credit 
 thats true and its a discrimination but you didnt increase the rate you decreased it 
 i think 
 its still a discrimination its still unlawful 
 applying it to credit a natural definition that is charging someone more than you charge others is an increase 
 when you say more in order for there to be an adverse action there has to be an increase or an unfavorable change and when you have an initial application you have to figure out what is the baseline in order to determine whether there has been an increase or an adverse action and you and the solicitor general just assert that the baseline in that situation is the best possible rate that you can get but i dont understand where that comes from 
 because charging someone more than someone else who qualifies for that better rate based on their credit is increasing them charging them more but its also evident from the statutory purpose which i think was a question you asked 
 let me look at the language go back to give me because in ordinary english which i hope i speak it is not an increase but maybe there is a technical term in the technical language of commercial law or in ftc law where the word increase means decrease and if you is there anything you want no its a serious question at least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses this word increase in the way you just suggested 
 we believe that its a standard dictionary definition to charge someone more for insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is increasing their charge 
 which dictionary shall i look at 
 i think we can look at any dictionary i dont have a cite your honor but 
 they are making this argument and i think you got close to it a minute ago when you alluded to statutory purpose i think this is whats behind and you tell me if im wrong one purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the consumers credit report may contain errors which are doing the consumer some kind of damage 
 yes your honor 
 and you want this consumer alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and correct it if possible 
 thats exactly right 
 reading the adverse action the way you read it it would give the consumer or consumers a tipoff in the maximum number of cases in every case in which the consumer might have done better if the credit report had assumed different facts on your reading theoretically the consumer is going to say i want to look at that report and correct it if its wrong but isnt the fallacy of that argument the fallacy of saying because that is one object of the statute every term within the statute has got to be read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that object and the trouble that we are having on the bench is that discrimination and increase are different terms increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline that the consumer previously had whereas discrimination does not and your reading in effect increase to mean discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that the consumer will look at the report isnt that the basis of your argument 
 i think it has to be an increase based on some aspect but the only way to give effect to that statutory purpose is an increase above what you would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit and of course 
 well thats a way to give every conceivable effect to that policy but the statute in drafting adverse or drafting the terms of adverse action may very well have said we dont want to give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if we do we will get into the situation that justice breyer described everybody will be getting notices and the notices will be meaningless 
 i dont think the notice is problematic because you are alerting the consumer to check that the information that the insurance company expressly relied on to increase your charge 
 to set the charge i mean thats circular to set the charge that it gives you 
 i dont think you need a prior charge to suffer an increase if i walk into a candy store and i have never purchased that candy before but the best price that day is N cents but they say we are going to charge you N cents i have certainly suffered an increase 
 by that you are talking linguistically but i am interested in the purpose so i looked up on the internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and thats about N percent so N percent of the public doesnt have the best possible credit score now i take it that means that you could in fact if its even roughly right have N percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that since its not perfect in N percent of the cases its quite possible that they wont get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people and if thats so in N percent of the cases they will send out notices and thats why i asked my question about the boy who calls wolf what will happen if N percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices i suspect that this is only intuitive that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease now do you have any light you can shed on that 
 sure the as an initial matter its not the perfect credit that is the standard its whatever would qualify you for geicos best rate and thats a much broader standard we dont know the exact amounts but if you look at geico ja N they have fairly broad tiers maybe five or six and of course not everyone is going to get the notice if your driving record totally eliminates if you have great credit but your driving record eliminates the possibility that you qualify for the better rate you wouldnt get notice in that circumstance either but the key to the notice is if i have very good credit but the information that the insurance company looks at is incorrect i will be charged more based on incorrect information without ever having the opportunity to tell the insurance company or whoever is collecting that information for them you have charged me the wrong amount and i in fact qualify for that better rate 
 dont you have that right independently though every year to look at a copy of your credit report 
 well whats significant here that has been added to the statute in the last two years but since N congresss concern is giving notice at a critical time when the insurance company tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an adverse action i wanted to also mention here its not just an increase theres also been a denial and that mr edo applied for insurance from geico and was denied insurance with the standalone company geico general so that is also an adverse action under the act 
 when you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate why is that why wouldnt you look at it relative to say the average insured who walks in the door 
 because that geicos argument and i think thats what they want presumes they are looking at accurate credit information and the problem is congress has always told that there is significant inadequacy in the credit information i think its cited in the national consumer law center brief in N congress was told that the error rate in consumer information was N percent and there was a N percent serious error in the rates under geicos interpretation 
 i dont understand what pertinence that has to my question which is why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase 
 because under geicos theory of the statute you may never get notice even though you are being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate information as long as you are not charge your charge doesnt move below average so a lot of people who are in fact intended to be protected under this act will not be protected until their charge goes below average even though the insurance company is continuing to charge them more based on inaccurate information 
 why do we how do we know that they were intended to be protected in this way by getting this notice thats the issue in the case 
 because going through the statute and the increase based on credit and then the notice will give them the opportunity to check since the consumer here is the its a system of checks and balances and unless you give this consumer the opportunity to check that they are in fact using the correct information it wasnt mistaken it wasnt driven down by identity theft you can continue to charge people more 
 okay so thats 
 based on inaccurate information 
 your basic argument is the statute the definitions of adverse action have got to be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer to ask to see his credit report thats your basic premise 
 both based on the premise and purpose of statute yes 
 all right 
 briefly addressing the application of the standard to the facts in this case we do think its appropriate to remand for further consideration in light of some new developments geico has just recently produced documents to us that addressly directly address the question of scienter here so if theres if you go past a minimum threshold 
 i have read your reference to those documents explain why you think thats so important 
 because those documents directly address the subject of standard here that geico was reckless or understood their 
 how do those documents shed any light on recklessness i didnt see that 
 im sorry your honor 
 how do the documents that you describe shed any light on the extent of their recklessness if any 
 i want to be careful because i had presented i asked to lodge them with the court and i can quote them if necessary but within those documents there is direct evidence that geico interpreted the statute exactly how we do that not putting someone in the best tier based on credit 
 whos geico i mean you are talking about particular lawyers at a particular level an ongoing debate about what this law means if you get one lawyer who says you know i think you could read it this way does that mean that geico reads it that way 
 no your honor in this instance this document involves top level geico executives and with respect to the advice of counsel issue frankly its a red herring we have never asked to compel the defendants in either of these cases or any of the cases we are involved in to waive their privilege they have got the right of course to offer advice of counsel as an affirmative as a defense in this case but we dont believe its necessary to prove our case to even reach what the counsel said we believe we can prove our case based on the documents and subjective intent alone 
 i still dont really understand this part of the case very much assume that a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three different ways read the statute its very ambiguous and we think the governments reading is the better reading and the executives think about it and they say no we dont think thats right has that proved reckless disregard 
 if the statute was clear and the guidance 
 if the statutes clear and of course miss mahoney said the district judge thought it was clear but the other way 
 and with respect to the district court we believe the district court here clearly erred as the ninth circuit found and the guidance that opinion certainly didnt precede the conduct thats at issue here the only guidance again available at the time supported our reading of the statute there was no guidance from and court or from the ftc or from anywhere that would have supported defendants interpretation at that time so thats another aspect of inquiry the subjective intent of the defendants if there are no other questions 
 thank you counsel ms mahoney you have four minutes remaining 
 if i could start by just responding to the issue of the new document i just want to emphasize that this document was created by people who werent lawyers it was done before geico even started using credit to price insurance they were said they were brainstorming about what the statute might mean and i would point the court to the supplemental excerpt of records at N where when geico implemented the policy that we are talking about here the they said that the intent was that we would send to the people who were supposed to get the adverse action notice with the early systems development we didnt have the ability to identify whether they were supposed to receive the notice or not that was because they had not yet developed the way to do with what they call the neutral where they compare how the applicant would have done if they hadnt taken credit hadnt taken credit into account at all and this is a procedure thats required actually in most states in order to ensure that those who dont want to allow access to credit reports or who dont have a sufficient credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning of those state laws and that means worse than the average loss ratio so theres nothing in this record even if you take into account the documents they are talking about to suggest that there was somehow a knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law with respect to a few of the factual or issues that came up safeco estimates that approximately N percent of all consumers that they are selling new insurance to now have to get notice under the standards established by the ninth circuit with respect to who can qualify for the top tier of credit its only at least at geico approximately N percent so N percent of the consumers would not qualify for that and the statute very plainly does not prohibit differential treatment based on persons with better credit nor do state laws and so the analogy as to race discrimination simply dont hold water because there congress has told you what the baseline is you cant treat any person of a different race in a different way and thats not true under this statute and instead its quite reasonable as geico has concluded to simply say look if we wouldnt if we are treating you worse than we would have treated you if we ever looked at your credit report worse than if you had an average loss ratio for this criteria we will send you the notice 
 why did they use credit reports is it just a hedge against late premiums and the cost of late premiums or does it bear on risk factors generally 
 well generally there are about N factors that they look at to try to come up with a prediction of loss ratio and someone who has a good credit history is generally regarded as responsible and responsible people tend to make less claims and so again its just one factor of N though 
 yeah may i ask this question the reading of the statute in subsection i about in the charges for insurance advice seems to favor your view but subsection ii about denial of employment really seems to read in favor of the governments reading 
 well actually i think that when you factor in employment it has it has the opposite effect because what happens here is if you are using employment verification reports consumer reports about employment there are all kinds of consumer reports how do you tell who had the optimal employment history how could the baseline be the best employment history possible 
 no but my point is it seems to me that getting a lesser salary it just seems like the first applicant would be an adverse employment action under subparagraph ii just do you see what im trying to say 
 that if you that in other words if you gave someone a lower salary 
 it adversely affects any current or prospective employee now the language in i isnt it doesnt read that way but the thing thats troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the light of what ii seems to say 
 your honor i think that if geico in this example if you actually pay them less because you looked at their credit report then geico would concede that that is in fact an adverse action so i dont think its inconsistent at all thank you your honor 
 thank you miss mahoney the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument now in no N original kansas v colorado mr draper 
 mr chief justice thank you and may it please the court kansas would like to address three issues today N years of success of the courts river master on the delaware river and N years of success of the courts river master on the pecos river demonstrate the wisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate circumstances on a river like the arkansas river which is the subject of this case secondly the court should affirm the neutral principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages owing at the time interest begins to run and third a N year compliance period would be consistent with the courts prior rulings in this case and would preserve an essential right of kansas and its farmers under this this compact that would otherwise be lost under the masters recommendation of a N year accounting period with respect to this accounting period i would note that in both prior opinions in this case this court has relied on the annual results of the hydrologic institutional model which is the standard for compact compliance in this case in the first opinion in N this court distinguished between monthly and and seasonal use of the model deciding that monthly use was too frequent but that seasonal reliance on the model for determining useability under article ivd of the compact was reasonable when the case was back here in N this court reviewed the calculation of damages which was done on a yearly basis as you can imagine the factors that go into calculation of damages vary from year to year and so it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the h i model as its called are accurate sufficiently accurate and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis 
 mr draper correct me if im wrong i i looked at these papers a while ago i thought they did it on a N year basis and they just moved it up each year using a different N years to calculate the the relevant amounts in the N th year 
 that is correct your honor it is a moving accumulation of N years of results 
 so they do use N years of figures to determine what the relevant years water would be 
 thats correct your honor in other words the the annual determination includes the most current year for which there is data and the previous N years adds all those up nets out the pluses and minuses and that determines whether in the year in question there is compliance with the compact 
 this will begin in N as i recall is that 
 that is the special masters proposal yes 
 and what i dont understand is even even if we agree with you that it should be done annually why why wouldnt you propose that it be done annually using the previous N years experience that we now have and then you know ultimately by N we can use the previous N years i i dont understand why we have to do it year by year and forego even N yearsbenefit of of this methodology 
 your honor i couldnt agree with you more in the sense that we should begin now with the accounting so that you look each year at the results of this standard which has been approved by the court for compact compliance in that year only and if if you accumulate it 
 no that thats i said just the opposite i said i i dont know why we should begin looking for this at this year only using this methodology why shouldnt we average this methodology over the previous N years 
 your honor averages will tend to smooth out the results and will hide the effects during dry years which is when the farmers in kansas who are the beneficiaries that kansas intended to benefit and both parties realize that they need this water 
 but your method your method will overemphasize the dry years so either way you have a a imperfect situation in your case year by year and in a dry year colorado perhaps must over compensate and if you have say N dry years in a row then its going to be work out to colorados disadvantage 
 your honor i believe the the result is the is the opposite if i may explain the model the the hydrologicinstitutional model has been made as unbiased as possible the one aspect in which we have identified a bias is that it favors colorado during dry years it tends to underestimate the depletions that would have to be replaced by colorado 
 thats the method that you are attacking but if you were to do it year by year wouldnt it be just the reverse 
 we dont believe that aspect of the model would be any different if we are doing it year by year wed simply be taking the results that are calculated each year under either approach and use those in that year so that if you have a dry year you are are calculating in that year whether there is compliance and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the compact which is to provide water when the farmers need it 
 do you do you dispute what what the master found here that the methodology is more accurate on a N year average than it is year by year 
 no your honor the longer the period of time you take the more the accumulated results of the model will match the measured 
 the actual yearbyyear results right 
 yes and i should point out that its impossible to know what the right answer is you can you can measure the flows and the diversions in the river and compare that to one of the runs of this model but its the difference between the two runs one representing the compact condition which is supposed to be met and the other representing the situation with the wells operating and its the difference between those two whose accuracy is in question 
 yes but i i 
 and no one knows what that is 
 i understand that that the master concluded that even as to a particular year the model will be more accurate if you use the average from the previous N years than if you just applied the model to a single year that even as to the real results for that single year the model will be more accurate if you use a N year average 
 your honor i dont understand it that way if you use N years you are adding to the most recent year results N years of pluses and minuses thats going to in most case mask what happened during that next previous year you will be looking at a N year accumulation of ups and downs and not analyzing what happened in in the year in question 
 is part or all of the objectives of both the the decree and the N year model to conserve subsurface reservoirs 
 not not directly your honor it it does preserve that reservoir in fact because depletion of that reservoir affects the stream flows and its the stream flows that are compacted here and that have up to now 
 well then well then why isnt if if thats so why isnt it that colorado shouldnt get credit for the wet years in in on an average you are concerned about the dry years it seems to me that colorado should be given some credit for the wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are are replenished or am i wrong am i wrong about that 
 i think in general your honor you are are correct the question about there are over deliveries by colorado i believe is what you are addressing is there is there a way to give colorado credit for that and there is a way there is a a an account in john martin reservoir which is N miles above the state line for those deliveries when they are delivered there if there is more delivered than is actually needed in that year to achieve compact compliance that can be retained there and except for a small effect of evaporation is available to offset depletions in the following year 
 i i thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either state 
 thats correct your honor 
 well how does that comport with what you just said 
 under those circumstances the water that would be delivered to this offset account in john martin reservoir is not a credit thats accounted under the compact for that year so it would not enter into the compact accounting for that year it would not constitute a a credit but it would be available as a practical matter to be used as a credit in the next year for current depletions so there would be no carryover in compact accounting 
 i dont i dont understand that statement you say it would be available to be used as a credit in a subsequent year do you really mean it would be used as a credit or do you mean it would simply be there to be used 
 i think your formulation your honor is is more correct 
 okay 
 it would be there to be used and it would not be a credit for accounting purposes yes 
 well if its not a credit for accounting purposes then they are going to owe you just as much the next year even though even though you had more water the previous year 
 this is under the assumption your honor that they have already met their obligations in the current year 
 yes 
 and it will be available as a practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent year and be accounted in that subsequent year i would point out that this is very important for kansas farmers that the the water be received when it is supposed to be delivered under the compact if water is is not delivered as required in one year it cannot be recouped in a following year certainly not N years later as would be possible under the special master 
 well then why are you using a N year model at all 
 its not a N 
 it seems to me what you are what you are saying is forget the N years just do it every year 
 thats what we are saying your honor and the model is inherently a yearly model it calculates actually results on a monthly basis and we have used it and the court has relied upon it on a yearly basis up to now 
 why dont you do it on a monthly basis indeed why dont you do it on a daily basis i mean the master found that this model really works if you if you stretch it out over N years you say N year why dont you do it month by month 
 well it it could be done that way and in fact your honor colorado uses parts of this same model in its own administration of groundwater pumping the same groundwater pumping for purposes of protecting colorado surface water users and it requires replacement of water on a monthly basis so it is it is possible but we believe with the yearly accumulation that that we have relied upon so far in this case and that the court has relied upon specifically for damages that that is an appropriate accounting period for this particular purpose and that is that is our proposal the proposal of colorado is no lets wait N years before and and accumulate it with the other N years before we require any replacement i would point out that the hi model the hydrologicinstitutional model is the best tool available for this purpose it was endorsed by colorado after the courts first opinion in this case when it the court approved using the model on a seasonal basis for the seasonal accounting of useability at that time colorado gave up its own model in favor of the hydrologic institutional model and as you can see from the masters report there have been several significant improvements in the model since that time i would also point out the correspondence the close correspondence that exists between this case and the pecos river litigation in the N s there you had a compact that like this compact did not specify any specific quantity of water in the compact itself but indicated that there was to be no depletions beyond the depletions that were occurring at the time of the compact with a few small amendments that i could i could mention but the basic similarity of the compacts is that the status quo at the time of the compact was maintained there was an inflow or outflow relationship that needed to be observed and was required to be observed by the compact it was expressed explicitly in the pecos river compact by a reference to an inflow or outflow method in this case it was expressed implicitly in article ivd of the compact 
 the master found that the role of the river master in the pecos case was quite different than the role of the river master you want to have appointed here he found that the role of the river master in the pecos cases was really ministerial 
 your honor we do not agree with that 
 you dont agree with what 
 with the description of the pecos river master as being as having only ministerial duties and i can explain why 
 please do 
 yes if if you refer to the appendix of our our blue brief on page aN you will see that the opening section of the pecos river masters manual sets out the inflow or outflow relationship that is to be observed in complying with that compact this is the form of an equation you can see y equals and a and a number there in in our case we have the the hydrologicinstitutional model which benefits from several decades of increased sophistication in hydrologic analysis to do the same job 
 the pecos master can simply apply this formula can he not and get the results that the compact requires 
 he he is to apply the formula your honor but theres a great deal of judgment professional expert judgment that needs to be exercised in order to apply it for example you have to separate flood flows from base flows when you look at the at the results of a of a gauge on a river you can see how much water was in the river at particular times but this has to be separated into two different kinds of flows that are treated differently under this compact 
 well one of the reasons im curious is that i believe the pecos master is an engineer hes not a lawyer 
 thats correct 
 hes also the cheapest master we have ever had 
 but it seems to me that the master you want appointed has got to be a lawyer and make legal decisions 
 your honor i dont believe so i think our master would be just as cheap 
 whats the difference 
 no the question was what about the 
 what what relation do you or yes working relation do you anticipate if if the river master is appointed between the river master and the commission does he go first to the commission and try to get agreement or 
 your honor no he would not formally interact with the commission just as the pecos river master does not formally interact with the pecos river commission 
 well what can what can the river master do that the that the commission or authority cant do i is the difference between the two of them call it a jurisdictional difference nil but there is process difference in the sense that the river master could say do this or dont do that whereas your your fear is that the authority is simply going to be deadlocked because everything has to be done unanimously is it a process difference 
 it is a process difference your honor the 
 but for that you wouldnt be asking for a river master then 
 well if there were an authoritative way such as a river master by which the annual recurring exercise of judgment could be accomplished we would not need the river master but i dont 
 but arent you bypassing what congress set up you have this interstate compact and this commission which you are saying well its ineffective because it has to there are three from each state and it has to do everything unanimously but what about the commissions authority to call in an an arbitrator when they are deadlocked 
 that decision also requires unanimity your honor and in the one case im aware of kansas suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by colorado its but its it takes unanimity to do anything under that compact administration including the arbitration option 
 but you are saying congress 
 mr draper could i ask you what is a matter of procedure what is your understanding of of how one would go about challenging the river masters decision if one disagreed with it do you go to the special master do you come direct to this court 
 your honor we have suggested that it be set up just as you have set up the pecos river master in other words if there were an objection to the determination the yearly determination of the river master it would be reviewable by this court 
 directly 
 directly 
 and the special master would be out the special master would be out of the picture as you describe it you the special master would be finished the river master would take over has there ever been has this court ever appointed a river master when the special master did not recommend it and as i understand both delaware and the pecos river case the special master recommended the appointment of a river master 
 your honor i believe in both of those cases the the special master was recommending the appointment of a river master but i would point out that in setting out the criteria for appointing a river master the court did not refer to that factor as as being part of the consideration 
 as i understand the system you propose the river masters decision would be appealable to us and we would review it de novo is that right 
 we are suggesting the same scope of review as on the pecos which is clearly erroneous this however is something that the court could decide to do differently than the pecos but the clearly erroneous standard comports with the the way master recommendations are handled in the district court under rule N 
 im very loathe to deprive either of the states of their their right to have this court decide matters between them 
 your honor this would not deprive either state of that right and in fact 
 well it would if they can only come here and and overturn the river master if hes clearly erroneous thats a thats a very high standard 
 well there as i say the court the court may set the review threshold as it sees fit 
 i i had thought that your proposal was de novo review this is this is new to me that that you want it clearly erroneous 
 your honor i would i would say that we have we have mentioned the clearly erroneous review standard because it was in the pecos framework it is not essential to our proposal a de novo review would be perfectly fine with the state of kansas 
 suppose the commission decided to appoint an arbitrator would the special pardon me would the river master then proceed independently and wed have two different recommendations 
 as under the pecos your honor if the if the compact administration as its called in the in the arkansas basin is able to come to a resolution of an issue then that would that would take care of that issue it would be not be necessary to have the river master address that and it would be an agreement of the states because it would either be an agreement because they had literally agreed before the or in the form of the arkansas river compact administration or that they had agreed to binding arbitration and had settled it 
 well then it would seem to me procedurally at least the river master would have if not the legal at least the practical obligation to refer things first to the commission 
 your honor the referral of matters to the commission is why we are here in the first place it cannot act without unanimity the state of colorado the state in possession of this resource can veto each and every action of the compact administration 
 that was the deal 
 your yes your state agreed to it 
 that was the deal they came to why should we kick it over they came to that arrangement and it was approved by congress and now you come back and tell us oh this is too cumbersome you should you should appoint this river master to do an end run around it i i it doesnt seem to me to be fair 
 your honor i dont believe that this is an end run any more than the enforcement of the compact is an end run around the administrative body that is set up in many of these compacts those are keepintouch type bodies if they can agree on things they are very useful and the arkansas river compact administration has been useful in areas where there can be agreement 
 no but you you agree that this is the the authority here is more than a keepintouch group your problem with it is is not that you need something more than keep in touch but that when you ask them to do something more than keep in touch the other state has a veto and and that simply gets you to justice scalias objection thats the deal you made 
 that is the that is the nub of our argument against reliance on the arkansas river compact administration that you cant look at it to settle differences about the implementation of this courts decree 
 what did the special 
 that is a 
 what did the special master mean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote problem but he said but the climate may be changing the compact administration under the chairmanship of the united states representative may again be seen as the best way to administer their compact and settle issues what was he talking about 
 your honor i think he was talking about the hope that he has that the states could work more cooperatively now despite the fact that it was on this river between these two states that this court was first asked to resolve interstate river disputes between states in N and we are here today still in dispute over this river 
 so there was nothing tangible behind his 
 nothing tangible your honor we perhaps he was thinking of the settlement that we have achieved on the republican river that case started was accepted by this court after rulings by this court it became possible to settle that case it has now been settled and the states involved in that litigation were kansas nebraska and colorado it was possible in that in that context it has proven impossible in this context and we can expect disputes to go on as they have over the last century if we do not have an impartial expert authority to resolve disputes between states that are going to come up every year every year there are questions how do you take the data this year and put it into the hi model while many of those issues have been settled because different forms of replacement and other different circumstances arise you have those every year and if you follow the lead that the pecos river cases of this court give us there is also the possibility to address the improvement of the tool for implementing the agreement of the states and that is improving the hydrologicinstitutional model on occasion as we have seen the master do over the course of this litigation that is allowed under the pecos river decree and we submit that it should be allowed under this decree as well and that is when the master would be exercising the most judgment in our opinion i would conclude by saying that a a river master is needed on the arkansas to deal impartially and expertly with annual questions that must be resolved to implement the hi model and that a N year compliance period will implement the intentions of the drafters of the compact and the needs of kansas farmers and is consistent with the yearly reliance that this court has already placed on the hi model i will reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if there are no further questions 
 very well mr draper mr robbins we will hear from you 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court i think i will begin by discussing the river master since thats where mr draper left off i want to make it clear first of all that i disagree with the assertion that the pecos river compact and the arkansas river compact are similar in the way they operate the pecos river compact did in fact specifically state that it was it intended to hold the level of of depletion of the system by mans development to the N condition the arkansas river compact to the contrary begins the the limitation clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the arkansas basin provided that the waters of the arkansas river are not materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use for the uses so the the arkansas compact contemplated that there would be a a more flexible effort at using the water of the river by water users in both states protecting the existing uses in both states from that future development now this this court has appointed a river master in two circumstances in both circumstances as pointed out by justice ginsburg the the special master recommended that because of the specific circumstances of the case that in fact a river master was appropriate that was on the delaware river and the pecos river in all other cases that deal with this issue where requests have been made by by states without river without a special masters recommendation the court has declined to appoint a river master theres a very good reason i think behind that colorado alone is the party denying interstate compacts in two equitable apportionment decrees if every time a state is dissatisfied with its neighbor is dissatisfied with how a compact operates it is able to come to this court and say please appoint a river master we are just having trouble with our neighbor you will become the water management the super water management agency for the country you have river masters if you its totally up to to your discretion but if you were to follow this line of thinking you end up supervising water distribution across the west and part of the east 
 well the disputes are going to come up here eventually anyway if the states are intransigent ultimately it will be a dispute about the application of the compact and it will come back here anyway wont it 
 justice scalia that is absolutely correct but the difference is where compacts have mechanisms within them that are designed to work out these differences i think it is in the courts interest and colorados position is and the special masters position was it was in the courts interest to refer these matters back to those compact administrations you 
 counsel do you think its any more likely today than in the past that the two states will be able to work out their continued disagreements 
 justice oconnor i agree completely with the special master the state of colorado has proposed as referred to in his ruling that binding arbitration be used and has committed itself to participate in that to the extent there there have been past conflicts colorado has said lets get them behind us lets return to the compact congressionally sanctioned method for resolving our differences and lets proceed down the road we will 
 but but colorado still has the veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will be appointed is that right 
 that is under the compact thats correct 
 yes yes 
 and so but but colorado has made a a very clear commitment to the special master and does so to this court that if arbitration is proposed colorado would participate we do not as a state find it very acceptable to spend the time money and effort to litigate these issues after all we have farmers kansas has farmers we need to get back to getting the water equitably resolved through the compact mechanism that is our proposal it was 
 so is it right then that lets imagine the special river masters name is mr smith and unlike me he knows about this stuff and he then you kansas wants mr smith to decide a certain number of issues call them issues on page N whatever they are and as far as you are concerned your client would say im happy to have mr smith just dont call him a river master call him an arbitrator so you are saying that when kansas says they would do it except theres a problem of getting unanimity you say the only problem is that you wont agree 
 at the present time thats the posture 
 now they are the obstacle to unanimity so the keys are in their own pocket if they want mr smith thats your view 
 our view is if they want to arbitrate pursuant to the compact the keys are in their in their pocket we do not believe 
 so the problem cant be one of unanimity because your side agrees i mean you heard what he said so im im trying to see 
 our side agrees your justice breyer with with the concept that this matter should be returned to the compact administration to resolve the differences in that forum 
 and and in that forum you will agree to binding arbitration 
 in that forum we will agree to binding arbitration 
 binding arbitration will will mercifully keep this stuff off of our desk wont it 
 yes it will 
 i want i want to make it very clear to the court that the state of colorado different than the situation in the pecos river acted very aggressively to ensure that it promptly came into compliance with the with the determination that in fact depletions were occurring impermissible depletions were occurring to the arkansas river within N years the state of colorados legislature had passed the appropriate legislation the state engineer had passed rules and regulations implemented them and enforced them the state had authorized millions of dollars in loans for the acquisition of replacement water and and the state of colorado your your ruling was in N by N it appears that the state of colorado was in compliance with the compact that is a significant and very difficult effort on the part of the legislature the governor the attorney general and the state engineer we do not believe that this is anything like the pecos river your master in this case has not said to you these parties are are torn will not get together and you need to have a master a river master appointed in this instance the state of colorado took the exact opposite approach they did everything they could to reduce the pumping of the wells sufficiently to allow colorado to meet the terms of the compact and that is an important fact you need to glean from the special masters report now the the other the only other point i want to make on this is that the the its its very important in deciding whether or not a river master is the appropriate course of action to determine and i i mentioned this earlier whether or not the court wants to be in a supervisory position i happen to agree that the states are entitled to seek redress of their concerns before this court and as you said in in oklahoma v new mexico you have a serious obligation to adjudicate disputes between the states where there are actual and existing controversies and and the fact that you would have a river master would not eliminate the potential for those controversies in our view the only way that you can get this matter off of your plate and into the position that congress recognized and and directed is to follow the special masters recommendation number N id now like to turn if i may to the issue of the accuracy of the model 
 may i ask you a question because you may not bother to talk about it otherwise about punitive damages your opponent didnt seem to think it very important but i have this question is it your view that the other state waived its claim to the punitive damages from N back either by not arguing it today or by submitting the different set of figures at the time the the issue was before the master the last time around 
 justice stevens in response to your question we believe that in fact the issue of prejudgment interest or punitive damages is law of the case in this matter the special master set out a formula by which he proposed how the damages should be calculated kansas argued for actual value of money a rather rigid theory of compensation and the special master chose in fact a balancing of the equities approach he suggested that the appropriate means to calculate those that prejudgment interest on the the nominal damages 
 did he did he make that suggestion or did the other did kansas make that suggestion 
 the special master ruled on how he believed the damages should be calculated 
 in this time around or in the preceding 
 in the preceding time around and what he said was that the damages from N to N should be should should receive a inflationary increase to reflect the inflationary tendencies but that they should not be dealt with under prejudgment interest in other words it shouldnt be compounded through prejudgment interest only the damages from N forward should be compounded using prejudgment interest kansas did not except to that methodology kansas excepted to the fact that he didnt give them prejudgment interest on the damages from N forward in the opinion that you authored for the court you accepted the masters methodology and you did one thing and only one 
 well the masters methodology really wasnt at issue 
 the masters 
 the only issue before us as i remember it was the date from which the prejudgment interest would run 
 thats 
 thats thats all that was argued and it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed sum rather than an a changing amount as years went by that clearly we would have the interest would have run on the existing liability but its an unusual case because the damages are changing as time goes by 
 it is and i agree with you justice stevens it is an unusual case but the the critical element here is that the master was looking for an equitable way to arrive at a damage sum 
 well except that as i read his report he was simply interpreting our opinion best he could on the second goround 
 this this goround 
 yes 
 thats correct justice kennedy 
 and and i think thats whats before us here it it seems to me that your best argument for no interest post N on the preN damages is to say well its uncertain its hard to compute but that doesnt quite work because this court and of course the special master allowed damages the interest on postN damages even though those are equally difficult to compute 
 it isnt the if i may justice kennedy it isnt the 
 so im im saying it seems to me thats your best argument but theres a flaw in there 
 i understand the but the in our view the state of kansas was obligated to take an exception if it disagreed with the methodology used by the special master and adopted in justice stevens opinion by this court there was a sum of damage that was calculated by that and reported to the court $N million by moving the year forward from N to N you automatically then reduce by some degree the amount of that damage calculation 
 no but did we your your view is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that past damage 
 prejudgment 
 preN 
 the the special masters methodology justice stevens was that the damages in his third report from N to N should not under a balancing of the equities bear prejudgment interest at any point in time they should only be advanced for inflation which was a proposal colorado made because colorado believed that it the changing a N damage to a to a N or at that time a N dollar value was only fair and reasonable we opposed the concept of giving prejudgment interest because it would it would be its as if if this were a commercial context we would have been able to identify that there was a damage going on and the theory in your prejudgment cases is we could have put the money in the bank 
 but we rejected that as to postN damages 
 you agreed that prejudgment interest justice kennedy should be applied to postN damages not to preN damages 
 well but our opinion didnt say it was just postN damages our our opinion didnt didnt answer the question and and the reason of course is we didnt actually think about it because nobody even nobody argued it at that time 
 our view was that that our view is justice stevens that an exception needed to be taken if the masters methodology was under challenge 
 so in a way you really are arguing waiver i think 
 we are arguing law of the case yes we are 
 which is consistent with his failure to argue it today 
 thats that is our position your honor i would like to if if i may move off of prejudgment interest i would like to talk while i still have a few minutes a little bit about this model and the N year average 
 can you give im im not sure i understand the dispute can you give me in in without using up all of your time a basically a simple example to illustrate the difference between the two contending methodological positions 
 yes i can justice souter under the the masters formulation which is agreed to by colorado the damages which occur in each year N through N are are computed at in as nominal damages in the year in which they occur they are then expanded by the by an inflationary formula which allows the dollar in N to be calculated in a N dollar in N and to the present any damages that occur are advanced both for inflation but then they are also awarded a prejudgment interest which is compounded in other words if inflation is N or N percent through the period on a longterm average but but investments are at N or N percent 
 i got you 
 those damages advance colorados kansas view is that commencing in in N all of the damages from N to the present should receive prejudgment interest the difference then becomes if you use the masters methodology the the current amount of money in N dollars which colorado would owe kansas is approximately $N million if you use the kansas methodology and this is the impact of prejudgment interest it would be $N million under the original formulation that was presented to the court the value under the masters formulation which did not charge prejudgment interest on the N to N dollars both states agreed that that would have been $N million so from colorados perspective having succeeded in our in our exception that the year should be N instead of N we in fact under the kansas theory lose some $N some million in the proposition which we dont believe is what the court intended let me let me turn very quickly to the model if i may the the issue here is not colorados obligation to deliver water to to the river system colorado has both senior surface water rights and the state of kansas that it has obligations to protect remember the compact envisions that this subsequent development cant injure water users in either kansas or colorado as a result colorado must ensure that on a monthly basis water is placed into the river so depletions are are compensated for in the system as they occur the problem here is not that process the problem here is a model that is inaccurate beginning in your first report you quoted with favor the special masters comments about this model in dealing with the winter water storage program which was an issue which you agreed should be dismissed several years ago you indicated that depletions shown were well within the range of error and it could not be told if it was an impact or an error that the model was describing 
 counsel your time is running short this is very important i think you misunderstood justice souters question he asked you to give us an example of the kansas versus colorado approach as to the N year model you answered him about the interest could you 
 im so sorry 
 could you tell us really 
 yes 
 give us an example of the difference between the two 
 yes the difference between the two is this we believe that the model over a long period of time as its developer mr durbin said is reasonably accurate we we agree with that and we are willing to use it like that but that means you have to use look at it over extended periods of time our view is that you simply look at the model which is predicting overdeliveries and underdeliveries predicting them they dont have any relationship to what colorado is really putting into the system they are predictions and in some years where you where you look back and you know from the gauges the model is overpredicting a significant amount you you want to be and you know in a subsequent year its going to underpredict you want to allow that to smooth out so that you are in fact getting close to whats really going on it is not an effort to carry dryyear depletions into wet years or vice versa it is in fact an effort to allow the models inherent inaccuracies to play out so that you get a more accurate result in each N th year 
 why doesnt why isnt the result that you of of your position that you would get a more accurate set of predictions if all you were making was a N year calculation but you will not get a more accurate set of predictions with respect to any one year and in fact it is with respect to any one year thats important under the compact in other words they they plan every year not every N years so why does a N year accuracy help you in solving the practical problem you have on a yeartoyear basis 
 as proposed by the special master the model is not used every N year or every N th year its used every year if you are looking at 
 i know but its used on the basis of N year figures which will not be accurate particularly with respect to any given year even though they would be they would be accurate if you were only interested in a calculation every N years 
 you are making 
 does it can can you can you get a better prediction on a yeartoyear basis is what im saying 
 you get a better prediction on a yeartoyear basis a a better prediction if you are looking at the model over N years versus looking at the model just running it in a given year colorado does not want to be in a position justice souter where we are accused of violating the compact because there is an inaccuracy in the tool that is being used 
 thank you 
 it 
 thank you mr robbins 
 thank you 
 mr feldman we will hear from you 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court its the position of the united states that that we agree with colorado and with the special master that a river master should not be appointed in this case the compact between the states of kansas and colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for implementing the obligations in that compact which has to do with colorados obligations to deliver a certain amount of water to kansas the commission is also charged with investigating violations of the compact and the compact includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to binding arbitration if the the states agree to that the the commission also certainly could use other dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the authority to do if it wanted to the states have agreed to that congress has enacted it into law and this court should permit the parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that might arise in the future rather than putting a river master in place under the authority of this court now the court has itself has frequently stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort is preferable to litigation as the special master pointed out in the two river basins just north of the arkansas river the republican river and the platte river the parties recently after having a dispute including these very same two states in one of them have come to a consensual resolution of the dispute that they had and i think that does show as the special master pointed out that these the states can in fact the disputes in those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect of well pumping among other things as the special master pointed out i think that shows that the states can use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution and this court ought to continue its oftenstated preference for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to problems of this sort if the court were to appoint a river master in this case then i think the question would arise in any future case in which you have two states that have conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity as what happened with river compacts equitable apportionments and in other areas whenever theres an inherently conflicting interest the court would have an appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree or judgment and i think rather than that that would be directly contrary to the courts other statement in the area which is not only that the court prefers and that its far preferable to have consensual resolutions but also that the court does not favor appointing agents or functionaries to carry out its decrees 
 so i guess we made a mistake with respect to the pecos river and what was the other one delaware 
 yes the pecos river i mean there were a couple of differences in addition to the ones that mr robbins pointed out one difference is that not only the special master but the parties in the pecos river case neither party objected to the appointment of a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of clothing the master with authority to make determinations that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous standard in this case there is a party that objects to it and i would i think theres another difference thats important that the court ought to keep in mind at the time the pecos river master was appointed federal rule of civil procedure N which the court has said that the federal rules provide a guide for this courts original cases rule N provided that findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and the court indeed used that mechanism for the it provided that the river master in that case would be reviewed under that standard as of N rule N its now rule N provides that masters appointed by district courts said their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo standard unless the parties agree otherwise therefore at the present time and again following the courts rule N that says that the federal rules of civil procedure should be guides and i think they are a useful guide the appropriate course here if the court were to appoint a river master would be to appoint one whose findings will be reviewable de novo but that itself raises problems because if the findings of the river master are reviewable de novo its really just a continuation of the current litigation and it doesnt really advance things any the parties will submit the evidence to the river master he will make his determinations and then they will come to the court thats really more what the special master does at the current time so i think that under all of those circumstances both the courts preference for a consensual resolution of disputes its disfavoring of appointments of agents to carry out its decrees the courts recognition that its the courts obligation to decide cases of this sort and it cant its not the obligation of other parties to do that and the commission that congress has put into place specifically to deal with this kind of problem and with a specific recognition that there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute resolution i think that the court should not appoint a river master in this case as far as the prejudgment interest issue its the position of the united states also that the special master and colorado are correct and prejudgment interest should not be awarded i think its a familiar principle in to this court in litigation that if a party when the time comes to make objections a party has to make all of its objections if it wants the court to hear them in this case the special master came up with a recommendation in his third report about how to what should happen with prejudgment interest under which the early years the the amount of the damages in those early years would never be subject to prejudgment interest now kansas objected to that and said we should move the year back to N we should get prejudgment interest on everything back to year one but they never made the objection that if you if the court disagrees with that which it did that the method that the master had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of N was incorrect that was the time that kansas should have brought it to the court and kansas didnt do that 
 so you are arguing they have waived the your argument is they waived the objection basically 
 yes i think 
 i dont think you used the word waiver in your brief and i dont think that colorado did either but i guess thats the essence of your argument 
 i i actually think its a combination of two things on the one hand what the court actually said in its opinion was that the special master had awarded damages only insofar as necessary to satisfy the demands of equity something to that effect 
 would you not agree that if it was a oneshot injury not an ongoing injury that the normal reading would be the injury the interest should run on the laws 
 i think in the normal contract case that doesnt have the kinds of equities that this case had that is the current rule that prejudgment interest would run but this kind of case involves damages that go back N odd years it could have been 
 and it involves continuing ongoing 
 and they are they are ongoing that are different in amount in every year that its not merely that colorado was violating the compact as of N although it probably didnt know it at that time but that kansas didnt bring a suit until N and the fact i think that colorado has always agreed to pay to adjust the damages for inflation so in essence kansas is getting a portion of what the prejudgment interest would normally cover for those early years i think if all thats put together i think the courts conclusion that the masters conclusion was just the amount that equity dictates was correct and that if kansas didnt like that it should 
 mr feldman the government takes no position on this N year versus N year computation 
 no the government doesnt have a position on that 
 too hard for you 
 that issue involves the particularities of this case and the government doesnt really have a particular interest in how that gets resolved if theres no further questions that concludes the argument 
 thank you mr feldman mr draper you have N minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court i want to state that we do not believe that we waived our position on the interest calculation as was just suggested in the in the last colloquy the reason that we didnt do that is because we filed an exception last time against every respect in which the special master was not recommending full interest and it turned out that the court chose the the test that we now have which is a relatively easy test to apply it has certain incentives that grow out of it that make sense and we believe that we sufficiently excepted to that if look at our brief from that exception the one in in support of our exceptions in particular particularly to page N footnote N we specifically addressed the issue that the the master was not allowing any interest in that N through N period 
 you are talking about the brief in the earlier case 
 in the earlier case to the third report of the special master i would also on the other points that were raised you need to be 
 this is a lot of money involved and and you certainly didnt argue it here i dont recall that point being argued and with all that money being involved i would have thought it would have been argued 
 well we were we were arguing the larger issues on interest but we were asking that interest not be denied to us during that N through N period that was very clear from our briefs and we specifically singled out that part of it in that footnote so i dont believe its appropriate that to conclude that we have waived that argument and i would point out also that the only reason that it was done that way and the calculations of the parties did did in connection with that review is because the special master required it there is no other reason that we did it we did not volunteer to do it that way we did not like doing it that way the master said thats the way its going to be in my recommendation how much would that amount to we did not agree in any way to that part of the calculation i would also point out that with respect to the amounts involved that you need to be careful the amounts cited by mr robbins are not from the same year 
 thank you thank you mr draper 
 thank you your honor 
 the case is submitted 
 we will now hear argument in alaska against the united states mr franklin 
 justice stevens and may it please the court because title to lands underlying navigable waters is an inseparable attribute of state sovereignty this court has long held that there is a strong presumption that each state receives title to such lands at statehood under the courts precedents the united states cannot defeat the states title unless congress has definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise made that intention very plain turning to the glacier bay claim in this case the united states asserts that it received title to the submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood but there is no express statement an unambiguous statement by congress evidencing an intent to defeat alaskas title to the contrary the proviso to section N of the alaska statehood act which is the only statute the united states identifies as ratifying the purported reservation of the bay in fact shows that title remains with alaska under the plain language of the statute the proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would otherwise have been transferred to the state under the main clause and this is important in this case it is undisputed by both of the parties and by the special master that the glacier bay monument was not included within the main clause the submerged lands therefore did not 
 well counsel you apparently you agree that the us retained title to the uplands in glacier bay national monument under section N 
 yes your honor 
 of the statehood act 
 absolutely 
 and why was federal title to the monument not sufficient to retain title to the submerged lands as well without reference to section N at all 
 because of section N your honor section N of the alaska statehood act provides that the federal government retained all of the property it previously possessed with one important exception except as provided in section N section N has two exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here section N incorporates the submerged lands act and thereby provides that alaska was to receive title to all the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters plus those N miles seaward from the coastline in order to put alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the states section N dealt with an entirely different set of properties what section N did was to transfer to the state a very specific and narrowly defined class of property property that was used for the purposes or solely for the sole purpose of of fish and wildlife conservation under three designated statutes those are the state localstate fish and wildlife conservation statutes again here it was it is undisputed that glacier bay is not included within the main clause therefore the 
 problem as you just said that that the main clause is very very narrow and we are told by the government that no wildlife reservation would come within that main clause so that there would be nothing to retain under the second clause 
 the government is incorrect your honor we have identified two wildlife refuges the kenai moose range and the kodiak bear refuge that were otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the proviso and heres why the united states is correct on that they argue in their brief that those properties were not included in the main clause because they were created under the alaska game law of N rather than the alaska game law of N in fact your honors those are the exact same statute the N alaska game law simply restated the N law with certain amendments what that means is that at statehood the kenai moose range and the kodiak bear refuge were in fact being used for the purposes under the alaska game law of N which was the thenexisting version these refuges were created in N prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute so those are two properties and and actually the legislative history we dont think the court needs to go to the legislative history because the statute is plain and also because theres a clear statement rule but the legislative history does indicate that congress was specifically concerned about those two very large refuges the kenai and the kodiak together comprise an area that is approximately the same size as the state of connecticut and congress concern or more specifically the concern of the fish and wildlife service was that alaska might not be able adequately to manage those properties but there was no such concern expressed with the monument thats at issue here because it was never going to be transferred to the state under the main clause 
 why why shouldnt we look to the tests set out in the idaho case here 
 we are advocating the tests set out in the idaho case your honor that test is a twopronged test 
 right 
 first you have to look and see if there is a 
 whether congress has notice of the inclusion of the lands and a federal reservation which it certainly did for glacier did it not 
 thats thats relevant to the first prong your honor the second prong 
 and second whether the transfer to the state would undermine the purpose of that reservation should we look to that 
 if the court were examining the the first prong your honor i think those factors might be relevant here though the test is set out in not only the idaho case but also the alaska case and that is that there has to be an explicit action by congress and idaho applies that idaho looked very carefully for some action by congress ratifying the reservation in that case here we need an action by congress the united states has identified what they contend is the action of congress that is the proviso to section N of the alaska statehood act that proviso though just does not cover these lands 
 why do you say explicit i i thought it said you have to make it plain which really might matter 
 in 
 what it says the language i think is or definitely declared or otherwise made very plain 
 yes in the 
 is that right theres nothing that says explicit right 
 well your honor in the alaska case and here i refer the court to page N of the N alaska case there the court said that congress must quote explicitly recognize or that congress had explicitly recognized the resignation in that case so the the court 
 but doesnt that simply mean that if it explicitly recognizes it has made it plain 
 yes 
 but it doesnt mean that it must be explicit in every case isnt that correct 
 well i i think explicit 
 you dont have to be explicit to make it plain its a great way to do it but thats its not the only way 
 it has to be definitely justice breyer you are correct it has to be 
 all right 
 definitely clear or otherwise made plain yes 
 if im correct then if im correct then i guess the main argument i thought is here we have a national park and we want to keep the national parks as the united states which youd expect its a national park and of course they want to keep the whole thing i mean its obvious you dont have to write everything thats obvious they no more want to give all the water in the park to alaska than theyd want to give the gamekeepers part to alaska a house or maybe theres a swimming pool somewhere they dont mention either but its just obvious that unless theres something very special about the water that the water in the park is part of the park 
 well there is something special about the water your honor and thats what the court has recognized the water is a state an essential attribute of state sovereignty and just to 
 i understand that but i mean its like saying we are keeping yellowstone but we are giving you the geysers i mean thats water too its even underground water but i mean what the argument i think is would be is this like that and the argument that it is like that is that well of course you need this water in order to study the glaciers because there are forests that go down to the edge because the flora and fauna cant be protected without it and so though it isnt as strong a case as the geysers in yellowstone its good enough now whats your reply 
 first of all the geysers are not included because we are talking about navigable 
 i understand that im using a funny example to 
 yes navigable waters 
 but let me let me just assure the court there is nothing at all unusual about stateowned submerged lands within national monuments the reason is simple the antiquities act which allows the president to designate national monuments was enacted in N at that time there were N states already in the union therefore any national monument created in those N states would necessarily have included stateowned submerged lands unless there had been some conveyance and let let me give your honors a a concrete example in the N california decision decided by this court the court recognized that the channel islands national monument which is an offshore national monument off the coast of california included stateowned submerged lands because even though the reservation order was asserted to have included those lands there was no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the states title another 
 like in yellowstone there is a river i think who owns that 
 well yellowstone was created before the state of wyoming and 
 no but i mean does the state or the feds own the the river that goes through it 
 one would need to examine the particular reservations and statutes there 
 what about in yosemite i think theres a river down there too is the river in yosemite owned by california or by the the feds 
 im not familiar with that but i will give you an example that i am familiar with 
 before you do that mr franklin is is the rule that that we are operating under that congress had to have made it clear 
 yes 
 that it reserved or is the rule that it is clear that congress ought to have reserved it 
 no its the former rule your honor 
 its the former 
 yes 
 so the mere fact that it doesnt make any sense not to have reserved it does not make it clear that congress reserved it does it 
 absolutely your honor 
 right but normally you assume i guess that congress does what is tries to avoid things that are ridiculous so if they say keep the park i guess the question would be is that included i mean 
 its not 
 can you read it this way i i think it would be relevant wouldnt it 
 well first of all this is not the ordinary in this case we presumed the the opposite in fact theres a strong presumption but let me give you the other example that i was going to refer to you 
 yes 
 theres something called the california coastal national monument that extends the entire length of california and goes out N miles to sea in that monument the the lands the submerged lands are both stateowned and federalowned and they are managed cooperatively and thats what we are seeking to do here and importantly the fact 
 mr franklin are are these submerged lands covered by navigable waters 
 yes 
 what is it that the government could do if they owned the submerged lands by way of protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want to do that they cannot do simply by by reason of of having jurisdiction over the navigable waters 
 there are a few things presumably very localized activities that the state would have the exclusive authority in importantly though the federal government even though the state owns title here will retain all of its constitutional authority under the interstate commerce clause to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce that 
 yes but just as a practical matter tell us what you are arguing about what does alaska think it can do if it prevails in the glacier monument area by virtue of prevailing as a practical matter 
 as as a practical matter there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing that are important to the state there are issues relating to local uses of the bay but more importantly 
 well could could you be concrete i mean there i dont know what you mean what are the issues can you give me an explicit example 
 well one explicit example is i think the state would prefer to have more local subsistence fishing in the bay and the court to to move out a bit the 
 so the state would permit more fishing than the us would allow 
 i think 
 as a practical matter 
 as a practical matter and and there there 
 but couldnt congress forbid that under by reason of its control of the navigable waters 
 well if 
 if it really wanted to 
 if congress really wanted to congress could could affect activities relating to interstate commerce but importantly what alaska seeks here really is a seat at the table right now alaska has no say over anything that happens in its navigable waters which are its sovereign state lands what it seeks really is to have its views being considered right now and i will give you a concrete example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the in the next count that i will discuss for some time cruise ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside or asserted by the government to be outside the scope of alaskas pollution laws and not within the scope of federal laws that was fixed but it took an act of congress to do that there had to be an act of congress to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge out in these what they used to call donut holes alaska finds it unacceptable to have to go petition congress every time something comes up on its navigable waters that it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with now if congress decides to preempt the state under its interstate commerce power it has the right to do that i think we also need to keep in mind what waters we are talking about this is southeast alaska the waters of southeast alaska quite literally define the region they are central to the economy the history the society and the culture of all the alaskans who live there and who travel there just to take an example there are still today very few roads anywhere in southeast alaska and the the towns and the cities like the the state capital of juneau historically were accessible only by the water this is an area the water in particular is an area that is of great importance to alaska and they are seeking to confirm that that area does belong to alaska and i think we have set forth in quite detail why 
 well there there are big differences between the the analysis concerning the bays that you assert and glacier monument i think they are quite different 
 well the the tests are different the glacier bay test involves needs to have an explicit reservation explicit ratification by congress of a reservation and 
 you are lumping them all together but i think the tests are quite different 
 the tests are different what i was trying to explain is in answer to your honors question why this matters to alaska it matters quite a deal 
 but in in respect to glacier bay 
 yes 
 i i mean is the only you said for example is the only dispute about the use of the water thats in the middle of the glacier bay park whether there should be more or less fishing or are there other things that alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they cant do if the united states owns it 
 there are two issues i think its fishing and also to allow more local people to visit the area that would otherwise be prohibited by the park service there was but just to assure your honors 
 how could they do that you mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water there but they couldnt get off the boat 
 well thats normally what what people do is they just visit the 
 i see 
 by boats but to assure your honor there for example there are no mineral interests here anywhere in the picture 
 all right so if if the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat and to go up along the waterway and to look at the glaciers on the shore then it surely is odd that the united states intended to give that waterway to alaska for under those circumstances there would be nothing left of the park i mean it would be like you see if its essential to it 
 well thats not true your honor N percent of the park even if one assumes it included the submerged lands is uplands but its no more unusual 
 no i understand that but i mean its the way of visiting the park 
 yes but i just mentioned for example the two monuments in california the channel islands national monument this court held included the the submerged lands were stateowned theres no other way to get to the channel islands monument but to traverse stateowned submerged lands in fact i think there are few national parks in this country you cant get to without going across state lands i think theres another important point here and that is the property clause of the constitution would also allow the federal government to regulate activities on lands that abut national parks to the extent that they might affect park activities but here what we need is an expressed statement by congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay without that your honors and the the precedents are clear without that the presumption is in fact the strong presumption is that these are stateowned lands and again there is absolutely nothing unusual that is part of our federal system its the way that these monument properties have been managed since N when the president first got the authority its the way that glacier bay will continue to be managed we expect we intend to work cooperatively with the federal government to resolve any issues that might remain what we are seeking here again is a seat at the table we just are seeking to have alaskas views dealt with because they are the owner 
 in the in the N case was the area at issue within the first part of N because this 
 yes the the court expressly stated that it was at pages N to N and that was in the absence of any contrary argument 
 it it made an assumption 
 the court made an assumption but in fact 
 but was it in fact 
 i think there would have been a substantial had that had that issue been litigated there would have been a substantial argument that it was not within the main clause but again there was no argument on that point before the court the court at pages N to N expressly stated again it was an assumption but the court expressly stated that the lands were within the main clause apparently the court was considering the fact that the application for anwr did in fact reference the purposes that were set forth in the main clause the alaska game law the important point of that case for this case though your honors is that the court embraced the construction of section N that we are advocating here namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the federal government a subset of the properties that would otherwise have been transferred to the state under the main clause there simply was no need for congress to have expressed an intent 
 i thought we had left that open i thought we 
 i think what i said is that the court embraced that position and it was actually an essential attribute of the essential premise for the courts holding at N to N and again at page N of the the decision what the court made clear is it was concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso all of them the submerged lands and the uplands would have passed to alaska under the main clause and that was one of the reasons the court i think held that it was covered by the proviso no such concern is present here id like at this point briefly to turn if i might to the count i which is the historic waters count there the united states asserts that at statehood the waters of southeast alaska were riddled with isolated enclaves of international high seas that were wholly surrounded by us territorial waters the historical record though belies that contention at least from N until N the united states took what this court has described in the mississippi sound case the alabama and mississippi boundary case as the publicly stated policy that the waters of the archipelago were inland and that the political boundary ran along the outside edge thereafter the united states took consistently based a discriminatory enforcement regime fisheries enforcement on that position what i mean by discriminatory is that the united states allowed us fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area 
 well the argument on the other side as i understand it is that the the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is is relevant it has no necessary implication for the historic waters doctrine what what is your answer to that 
 thats the assertion my answer is that the court announced to the contrary in the N decision the cook inlet case there at page N and N and this is quoted at page N of the blue brief what the court said there is it examined an incident in which a japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general area and the court said and i quote that incident deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel more than N miles from shore manifests an assertion of sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and quote must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the waters in question 
 what what page was that 
 im sorry thats N to N N and N of the cook inlet case and thats at N of the blue brief what the law was at statehood is that the united states had no authority after N miles out to enforce discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign vessels now importantly theres a caveat here and that is that the law has changed the law has changed since N beginning in N the united states asserted a N mile whats known as an exclusive economic zone that allows the united states to enforce discriminatory fishing and in N international law embraced that but and we have quoted a un study in fact the un study that we have quoted and that is noted at page N of the blue brief that is the study thats called the juridical regime study its the study that this court itself in all of its historic waters cases has used as the authoritative statement of the law that study quite clearly states that if a if a country enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign vessels outside that that manifests an assertion of an historic inland waters claim and what we have here 
 on on this point it seems to me there unlike the first point you were discussing where i think the federal government can work its will anyway on this point there is really a significant federal interest involved that is to say if the united states takes the position that these are indeed inland waters its going to have to acknowledge similar rights in foreign countries with similar archipelagos 
 no your honor they assert that but they dont provide any specific examples and the reason they cant provide a specific example of any instance abroad where it would affect their position is that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own facts the fact that something is an archipelago does not render it historic waters 
 but but you say a determinative fact a conclusive fact is simply is simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations 
 it is a claim to the to the waters which was made in N accompanied with discriminatory fishing enforcement accompanied with other statements in this case including the california brief to this court there has to be an excuse me an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before one can conclude that waters are historic waters these ones are other waters would not be the united states has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely these constellation of facts so its its position is basically we say it therefore it must be so i 
 but its not the united states that will be making the judgment about what areas are controlled it would be the country abroad and i i think the argument was what the united states does other nations will copy 
 right 
 and they will decide what looks like the alaska 
 right what the united states does your honor is follow the wellsettled international law on historic bays historic waters those are set forth in the convention each state will have the same authority where its facts and circumstances dictate it if there has been a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the acquiescence of foreign nations then it will qualify as historic waters but it has to be done based on a an examination of the particular facts of the case and one thing else one thing other that is worth noting if you have an archipelago like this a nation can always close it off using article N straight baselines that is permitted under the convention the us has decided not to do that but other states are fully able to do that i think that if the united states is going to be arguing that there is some international precedent here thats going to hurt it adversely it needs to identify a particular body water abroad that it believes this case is going to affect 
 why should it make that suggestion it would certainly not be in the interest of the united states 
 well it it needs to explain more specifically then other than just stating we think it might affect our position the the facts and circumstances the court for example applied the historic bay question in mississippi sound in the mississippi sound case i am aware of no instance in which that precedent was ever used adversely and the united states has not identified any any instance but more importantly what this court did in the mississippi sound case is it looked at the evidence and it said is this a historic bay or is it not the court concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the court follows at this point id like to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal 
 yes mr franklin mr minear 
 thank you justice stevens and may it please the court i would like to begin with the focal point of alaskas argument namely glacier bay national park alaskas core contention is that section N of the statehood act does not provide an adequate showing that the united states intended to retain the submerged lands in glacier bay for this 
 could before you go into that could you tell me how N begins 
 yes in fact i think its very helpful its listed at page N a 
 i mean 
 of our of the gray brief 
 yes but the well well the the introduction to it is is not listed is it i mean 
 that may that may be so 
 i mean its incomplete it it just says all real and what about all real and personal property is there an intro that says there is hereby there is hereby granted to the united to alaska 
 well N i think begins stating that this these are exceptions to section N which is the retention the general retention provision of the united for united states lands but if we look at N itself its 
 well you say they are exceptions how how are the exceptions introduced i mean its incomplete to just read that says all what about all real and personal property of the united states there has to be some introductory language what is it 
 no actually there doesnt your honor because if you go on it says all real and personal property then you skip down about halfway down shall be transferred and conveyed to the state of alaska by the appropriate federal agency so it is so this is complete in terms of 
 okay okay you are right 
 but if i could walk you through those provisions because i think they are quite important the first provision says as you say all real and personal property which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall be transferred to the united states 
 right 
 its followed by another provision here 
 to to alaska 
 to to alaska excuse me and its followed by another proviso which says that the united states will continue to control fish and game matters in alaska until the secretary of interior has certified that alaska is ready to do so clearly that proviso is not a subset 
 mr minear before you get too far i also would like to ask a preliminary question that was raised by justice oconnor before do you agree that section N itself the second part of it that says the united states retains title to its own property that the response to that is adequately provided in the submerged lands act referred to in subparagraph 
 no i dont i dont believe let me frame the your your question if i may for you section N indicates the united states would retain all of the lands that it presently holds section N then makes the submerged lands act applicable to the to the to alaska in doing so it recognizes that there are some lands the united states would continue to retain provided it meets the requirements of the submerged lands act the particular exception we are concerned about here is the expressly retained exception in other words if lands are retained by the united states this court said in the arctic coast case that that provision adopts the general law that applied before the submerged lands act that it had to be made plain that the united states would be holding onto these lands it doesnt require an express statement it simply requires that it be made plain now our view is that these lands would be retained by the united states quite apart from N the N exception we are arguing about here on summary judgment and if you denied our motion for summary judgment wed go back and talk about the other exceptions that are applicable but in this case we are simply focusing on N and we are focusing on that because the courts arctic coast decision made clear that N and i quote reflects the very clear intent to retain title unquote to submerged lands quote so long as those submerged lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife or reservations for the protection of wildlife 
 well we didnt have this issue before us let let me 
 yes we did 
 let me why dont you go back to your argument you said that the first proviso on its face is simply not a subset of the first part of 
 yes its an example how provisos do not need to be 
 but thats not the proviso at issue here 
 yes 
 the proviso at issue here is the second proviso which begins provided that such transfer shall not include lands such transfer now this is the word such refers you back to something what what possible transfer could it mean except the end of the introduction which says shall be transferred and conveyed to the state of alaska 
 your honor 
 i mean anybody reading that would would think that proviso refers to that transfer or at least it is not clear that it provides to that it applies to every transfer in in the whole act 
 i disagree with you justice scalia for these reasons first of all the such transfer simply tells you whats not included that language tells you this is outside it doesnt mean that whatever follows necessarily was within the main clause what congress was doing here by making clear that these lands were not transferred 
 what does the such refer to 
 it does refer to the transfer before but what follows here refuges and reservations for the protection of wildlife they do not fit within that that main clause its obvious they dont because the only things that fit within the main clause are those lands and real property specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife what we are talking about here wildlife reservations are multiple purpose lands they are not used solely for for the purpose of conservation the purpose of the first provision here was to transfer vehicles fish hatcheries other equipment that the state would need to enforce alaska game laws that was the point of of that first provision but secretary chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative history that what he was doing was drawing a line between those those facilities and equipment that are used by a state in its traditional game management and drawing a contrast with the matters that would be retained by the united states 
 where is the language that says that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained by the united states 
 we do not need 
 what the proviso says is just what justice scalia said 
 we do not need express language that expresses 
 no no but where is the implication in that 
 the implication is that we are retaining all of the reservation and this is what the court said in the arctic coast decision it saw that this was 
 thats thats it i mean in in i take it in the alaska case we were considering a transfer that did fall within the main sentence of 
 justice breyer neither party made that argument this issue came up in a letter that was written after the the language 
 were we or werent we 
 you were not considering that 
 we werent 
 that that was simply neither party suggested that anwr fell within the first provision and it doesnt its clear that it doesnt it was not land that was specifically used solely for conservation of wildlife under these three listed statutes the anwr reservation at that time was set apart it was blm land it was also used for mining and other activities likewise the other matters 
 but the court did assume the court did assume that 
 yes 
 it made that assumption with no briefing but it did that with regard to the second issue that was presented there the issue that people were fighting about in the arctic coast decision was was this land properly set apart or not for purposes of the proviso and thats where this discussion takes place 
 all right then 
 its an afterthought that simply reinforces 
 all right then at best alaska is a neutral because we didnt think it we are operating as a mistake its a neutral okay now whats bothering me about the case is just what justice scalia said that that why i if i sell you all my clothing and then i put but not my camping gear i mean i can absolutely see you dont get my camping clothing but you want to say thats a reservation of mess kits from some other transfer i mean it has nothing to do with mess kits 
 your honor but thats its clear that what this is this is more along the lines if someone said that i will sell you my house provided that transfer shall not include the detached garage 
 fine and then it doesnt go in that 
 in that case 
 but it doesnt mean that the next 
 yes but it was not a part of the house 
 yes 
 you know thats its just providing clarification just that one of the purposes of the proviso is to provide clarification 
 this is an abundance of caution 
 in other that is exactly right and we can tell that from 
 all right if its an abundance of caution wheres the other language that almost reserves it so we need the caution 
 that would be section N it indicates the general retention for lands of this sort 
 but N is subject to the submerged lands act and the submerged lands act brings you back to the reservation has to be explicit and then see thats 
 well justice breyer again if i can just complete the point 
 thats why i was talking about yellowstone 
 yes 
 i was looking for something that would be obvious that they wouldnt have meant to transfer he comes back and says well very often states do control the water 
 your honor i just need to make a point i think its very important for you to understand this point first of all that at page N of the arctic coast decision this court was clearly reading this language the N proviso as sufficient to provide a clear indication of transfer of title and in doing so it was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself that these particular items that are discussed there are not a part of the main clause and cannot be and a good example of that is the third thing thats being transferred facilities that are utilized in connection with general research activities related to fisheries and wildlife now that is not going to be something thats specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife its the antithesis of that it makes quite clear that our construction is correct the subset theory just doesnt work because the items that are here are not things that fit within the main clause what congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line 
 but why why doesnt supersede that argument anyway lets cant we say that well you may be right so far as the second clause of is concerned but you still have to deal with 
 then you have to explain what happened in the arctic coast case why we were able to retain the anwr lands which did not fall within the main provision and that is because congress was making because this court concluded that congress was making clear that wildlife lands are very important and they wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not be transferred and even a provision that could be misconstrued as im afraid this court did in in arctic coast could be misconstrued to contain some of these lands we need to make adequate assurance that that the courts that read this realize a clear division is being made we are retaining these wildlife lands thats 
 mr minear im im not sure i agree with you that that that language facilities used in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife is not a subpart of the earlier of the earlier grant namely property used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of fisheries and wildlife surely one one can readily regard general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and protecting fisheries and wildlife 
 but we are talking about a facility here so a facility that might conduct some some research tangentially related to wildlife is not a facility thats used for the sole specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife theres a clear difference here these two these two sets do not overlap and its even more so with regard to wildlife refuges wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are used for multiple purposes at the time of statehood the the regulations in place the fisheries regulations and wildlife regulations made clear that permits could be issued for purposes apart from wildlife conservation and this courts own decision in udall v tallman recognized that one of the the refuges that alaska cites as being included in the main clause was being used for oil and gas purposes it was not being used solely for the purposes specifically used solely for the purposes of conservation 
 mr minear you know i i am just overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible mess of a statute i cant figure out what it means 
 well your honor 
 and and it seems to me thats exactly why we have a clear statement rule 
 your honor 
 there are arguments here there are arguments there but it it does not dawn upon me that that anything is clear about this at all 
 well this we believe the statute has been clear for N years thats why these issues have only arisen recently with regard to glacier bay national park 
 mr minear what do you say are the practical consequences from the federal governments perspective of going of disagreeing with the us position what harm is done can the us protect itself in any event under other clauses 
 we agree that the united states has the regulatory authority to protect to limit vessel entries and protect commercial fishing but thats not what our concern is our concern is with the actual use of the submerged lands this is a laboratory this is a laboratory for scientific research and we occupy and use the submerged lands for that purpose that includes such things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze its historic features we have installed a N mile cable with a hydrophone on the on the submerged lands so we can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the the volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that migrate through there 
 dont you do that on on dry land in some states 
 your honor in order to hear vehicle traffic 
 doesnt your authority under the commerce clause or under under over navigable waters allow you to do that kind of stuff 
 your honor we think that that alaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot withdraw materials from the submerged land which we use and study and in fact i would point out that the park superintendents affidavit 
 are they likely to do that 
 what 
 are they likely to do that is this a real problem 
 there are N papers scientific papers that are cited in the affidavit of the park superintendent this is exhibit number N on count iv and of those describing the type of research we do in glacier bay national park 
 well i thought 
 scores and perhaps hundreds of those involve submerged lands 
 all right given what you are saying and i you are not accepting this i think and i well there is language in this act which maintains in the united states title to the park 
 that is correct 
 all right now i would have thought when you get title to the park you mean the park and by the park you mean those essential parts of the park 
 we 
 and therefore if you have a part of the park which is the only part of the park where people look at the park and its the only part of the park that brings them into the park and its the only part of the park where you do the research et cetera thats the park just as if i were to sell my house and i list the rooms and forget the kitchen well the kitchen is an essential part of the house 
 thats 
 now now once i made that argument he said thats a very clever argument but really there are all kinds of instances where states have reserved submerged land inside national parks and its worked fine 
 but those are instances 
 whats your response to all this 
 the instances the examples they are giving are cases in which we have created those national monuments or parks after statehood and in those cases we cannot acquire those lands because they have already been transferred to the state at statehood 
 it hasnt resulted in a in a disaster thats the point that justice breyer is making 
 but in this case 
 it has not resulted in a disaster 
 but in this case it is going to impede the the activities we have there and a good example of this is in the amicus brief at page N where alaska does not even assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife the alaska legislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife within the park this gives you some sense of the type of difficulties that we are going to encounter 
 mr 
 and our chief concern 
 mr minear may i ask you at the time the statute was passed was the national government conducting these activities 
 yes it was it was created as a national monument now in terms of what degree of activities the record is not clear but we are 
 maybe you were monitoring passages through to see whether the whales were going to be interfered with and doing that sort of thing were you taking core samples 
 we were definitely studying the bed of the lake and our our briefs below explain we have an affidavit from our glaciologist which describes the type of research that was being done 
 so in in other words you you are saying it is fair to say that at the time of the passage this would have been on the congressional mind going back to justice breyers 
 it it definitely would have and also i want to point out that when we created the national monument we also preserved such things as the interglacial forests these are forests that are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go forward over these submerged lands the glacial forests are in the submerged lands and so they become a part of it as these glaciers continue to retreat its likely that other glacial forests will be revealed and those should remain a part of the park that was part of the purpose was to study those 
 should now you are not how far are you prepared to go you cant go more than your brief and your facts justify are you prepared to say that this water is an essential part of the park 
 yes 
 yes 
 yes certainly 
 have you said that before this minute 
 not only have we said it but the park service at statehood said that this is a water park when they were describing these lands and saying why they should be retained they told congress the the park superintendent or the the director of the park service said this is a water park thats mostly this is after all glacier bay national park and in that with that respect id like to point out this 
 why did they keep the other N percent then 
 excuse me your honor 
 why did they keep the other N percent 
 well the 
 i gather only N percent of it is water 
 its slightly more than N 
 they should have given away the rest 
 we havent given away we have all of these lands the the uplands here are the glaciers and the mountains that are inaccessible except by the water you cannot reach these areas there are no roads in this park except for the park visitors center and beyond that 
 then make it a water park i mean you want to say its a its a wateraccessible park fine 
 yes but your honor the 
 N percent of the park is under water right 
 more than N percent roughly N id say close to N percent of the park is within the park boundaries is submerged lands but theres another point id like to make with regard to the establishment of the park this park was created under the antiquities act and under the antiquities act the president is given authority to create national monuments but they cannot be disestablished except by act of congress now congress could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to give up the land it could have disestablished some part of it and it chose not to do so and yet thats another indication that congress was intending to retain these lands now i would like to move on to the other two counts we have here unless we have further questions about about glacier bay but i i think one thing that i do one thought i want you to leave you with with regard to glacier bay is that these lands are essential to the park they are understood to be essential at the time that the park was created and the the line we are suggesting here is a very reasonable one with regard to this park those lands are continue to be used the submerged lands for scientific research that is vitally important now id like to point out that the master also correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits are historic inland waters and on that basis alaska failed to satisfy any part of the courts threepart test this court specifically failed to show a continuous assertion of of sovereignty to exclude vessels that have that are visiting the park or passing through in innocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of foreign nations during the past N year period neither alaska nor the united states ever attempted to exclude a vessel based on merely on innocent passage rather alaska alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we unambiguously did so the only 
 alaska is arguing as i understand it now that the the exclusion for purposes of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a matter of international law which is a point that you disagree on what what is your response to their response to 
 the answer is in order to establish a historic inland water claim you have to exclude a vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage fisheries is not engaging in fishing activity under the convention is not innocent passage and so therefore an exclusion based on fisheries can never can never give rise to a claim of 
 and whats whats your best authority for that 
 well our best authority is the convention itself the convention makes clear under article N that fisheries is that fisheries activities are not innocent passage rather innocent passage is merely transit through from one point to another moreover the marguerite incident that they describe involves a single incident that is it does not satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland the historic inland waters test requires and finally it also didnt satisfy the acquiescence test since the british government protested the seizure of the ship and finally on top of that this vessel we dont know exactly where this vessel was at the time that it was seized there continues to be a dispute and the master was unable to determine whether that the ship was in inside or outside the N mile limit now id also like to speak briefly to the juridical juridical bay claim as well this is a matter that alaska did not touch upon but i imagine it would address on rebuttal the master correctly rejected alaskas extraordinary claim that the alexander archipelago can be turned into two large large juridical bays and basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland on an island now that does not suffice the purpose of the convention the only way that it can establish a bay headland or or closing point is by showing that its on the mainland in order to establish that this is on the mainland alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of water and as the master recognized these bodies of water are simply too substantial to ignore in the case of these bodies of water keku strait is N miles long on average N and a half miles wide its simply those intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish that this is is part of the mainland its also separated by wrangell narrows which is a N milelong strait that is an important passage for international navigation that too precludes it from being ignored and treated as dry land the failure of those two assimilations by itself is sufficient to establish that that these that these juridical bays do not exist and even if that were not enough the master went on to say that this would not be a wellmarked indentation that even if you were willing to assimilate these lands its still the case that the bay itself would not be the supposed imaginary bays that alaska has created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is passing by for all those reasons the juridical bays here are are simply not well founded and the master was correct in rejecting them so what we see 
 mr minear could i go back to glacier 
 certainly your honor 
 park again for a moment and ask why the government decided to base its claim to the lands in glacier bay exclusively on that murky provision of N rather than to talk about the standards set out in the idaho case 
 well your honor 
 do you do you not rely on that standard 
 quite 
 of analysis 
 quite honestly we thought that under the arctic coast decision the court is required to create absolutely new no new law it had already interpreted N and it was clear that section N applied to this case we think the idaho provisions provide another opportunity for us to establish it its quite clear that the purposes of the the lands here the submerged lands are so essential to the park that its simply inconceivable that congress would have intended for those lands to pass out of ownership however we relied on 
 would you would you tell us again why if you do not prevail on this argument you still go back before the the special master to show certain facts 
 well first of all alaska has not moved for summary judgment we moved for summary judgment on some of our theories other theories would require some factual development one of the theories that we would we would go forward with is that these lands are occupied under a claim of right and thats another exception under the submerged lands act in addition we would renew the argument with regard to antiquities act that once congress takes an area and authorizes the president to set it aside under the antiquities act and provides that it cannot be disestablished except by act of congress we think thats a very clear indication of congress intent to retain those lands 
 well given the absence of a summary judgment we wouldnt have to address that 
 no you would not have we we believe the master adverted to this claim but we do not think that he foreclosed it but rather id like to discuss briefly the relationship of idaho and alaska because i think its important and worthwhile we think that this case falls squarely within the alaska arctic coast case and in particular we relied on it primarily because it provides an actual textual basis for showing that the the united states retain those lands we do not need to go further and show purpose although we certainly can we relied on the alaska case because we think it provides a very clear example of why retention is is required in this case the master agreed with us he analyzed the arctic coast decision and he concluded that the the proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent retention clause theres no other way to understand the arctic coast decision except on that basis and we think thats the right interpretation and we think if we if you focus on what the court said on pages N to N it becomes quite clear the statement that alaska relies on to create its socalled subset test is an afterthought at the end of the opinion its a statement thats made in the courts words to reinforce the conclusion its already reached it doesnt provide a basis for for departing from that and in fact as i hope i have showed to the court the subset test doesnt make any sense that they are simply all of those lands that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall within the main clause the wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple purposes its the two wildlife refuges that they point to both the record shows were used for multiple purposes they were not used solely for conservation purposes and in addition they were to the extent that those refuges adverted to any lands at all any statutes they were referring to a N statute not not the N statute furthermore there are N other refuges that we believe that congress intended to retain that alaska has no answer for one one of those refuges in particular the semidi islands quite clearly describes within its boundaries submerged lands reefs and other areas it clearly is being used for those purposes we think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly that it was meant to ensure to provide the clarity that this court needs to determine that congress clearly did intend to retain these lands that was the point that that this proviso as secretary chapman himself indicated and in fact he stated in the excerpt appears in page on page N note N of our brief he stated that these reservations the land and water would be reserved he clearly was aware and told congress that that was the purpose here to reserve both land and water finally id like to ask the court to step back and look at the big picture here the united states position overall results in a very sensible division of submerged lands in this case we have not contested alaskas right to the vast majority of the submerged lands here that are encompassed in tongass national forest rather we have identified two areas where the federal government interests are paramount first of all with regard to drawing international developing international principles to establish baselines which creates these bays and and pockets thats a necessary consequence of what our foreign policy requires secondly where the united states has clearly reserved a unique treasure namely glacier bay national park this park was set aside for the benefit of the entire nation we think that the court should adopt the masters report in full thank you 
 thank you mr minear mr franklin you have about N and a half minutes 
 thank you your honor to get back to the idaho case we are in fact advocating the principles of that case it is not sufficient that congress be on notice of a reservation that might include submerged lands congress has to take some action to explicitly ratify that that was what happened in the idaho case according to the court and the united states has identified one statute and one statute only that it asserts can ratifies the bay and thats section N the proviso we think the plain language to section N is dispositive in this case we are operating here under a clear statement rule the presumption is in fact the strong presumption is that if congress does not expressly ratify the reservation congress is presumed not to have intended that the submerged lands title to submerged lands be defeated there was the statute says such transfer shall not include there simply was no need for congress to have included to have specified that such transfer the main clause transfer shall not include submerged lands when they were not included or excuse me shall not include properties that were not included in the first place that includes glacier bay 
 would would you respond to the to the argument that the alaska arctic coast case decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection 
 well my my first response is even the master who ruled who who decided against us did not find that the alaska case decided that and indeed it could not have because the court at pages N and N expressly assumed that the lands would fall within the proviso therefore excuse me the main clause therefore the court did not hold and could not have held that lands that did not fall within the main clause were included by the proviso it is important though to to note this that even if the statute is ambiguous and we think that it is not alaska still prevails here because a there is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute 
 but the the argument is that it is clear because the reservation without the reservation of the waters would be crazy 
 well it 
 why isnt i mean whats whats the answer 
 we dispute that for the following reason your honor that that the the point of the monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the glaciers as they recede on dry land title to the submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose but i think their skyisfalling argument really falls apart here all that the counsel can point to is the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom there is absolutely no contention here that alaska would would prevent scientists who want to study this these lands from doing that we let scientists onto all of our properties all of our submerged lands when they have a good reason for doing it we hope to work cooperatively with the federal government on this the the idea that alaska is somehow going to be less receptive to scientific research here i think demeans our federal structure we have a federal structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands is given to the states because they are viewed as the ones principally affected by the activities that go on there we are not planning on on preventing scientists from scuba diving down there by the way they did not at the time of the monument your honor do scuba diving because there there really wasnt any scuba diving going on but to to move on i see my time is up 
 thank you mr franklin the case is submitted
