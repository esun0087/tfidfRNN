 yes 
 so they could have banged on the front door 
 they they could have though the evidence was that and the trial court found that it was so loud and tumultuous that nobody would have heard it or probably would not have heard it 
 but im a little puzzled if the noise is the cause of their being there and if the noise is so loud at N in the morning that its still continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the door they knock on the door several times and shout would they not have the right to go in then to quell the noise 
 absolutely all that i am maintaining is that they would not be justified under a safety exigency to go in certainly to as far as disturbing the peace then yes but not where the proffered justification is safety 
 so if you are going to rely on the safety and the safety and the danger of harm how serious does the harm have to be and i use the word harm as defining the the threshold for this kind of entry what if a father was spanking his child for example 
 no spanking of a child would not theres no indication under most circumstances of an intent to injure or abuse now of course if there are circumstances that would suggest abuse then officers could go in 
 doesnt yelling so loudly you cant hear police knock at the door at N in the morning suggest that violence is at least imminent or may well be associated with what they are hearing 
 it certainly approaches that but again what we would maintain is there probably has to be more than simple shouting if if its accompanied by threats or a show of force or violence then certainly they could go in 
 is there in addition to the safety rationale which you are justification which you are arguing here is there a justification to go in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved or not 
 yes 
 is is that a separate 
 yes that 
 i mean you see a guy turning out counterfeit dollar bills $N bills and can you go in right away if you see him doing that 
 well its a crime ongoing in progress so there certainly could be made an argument now whether or not theres an exigency i think thats doubtful because police could secure the scene and secure a warrant and then execute that warrant 
 well i mean but if thats the case you have a much easier argument wasnt there an assault here there was clearly an assault 
 yes and certainly where officers have reason to believe that theres an ongoing assault officers can enter now one of the problems with the utah supreme courts holding in this case 
 in connection with the answer you just gave it doesnt matter then if its an ongoing crime they can go in it doesnt matter whether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony it doesnt matter how grave the crime is 
 well this court in welsh indicated that minor offenses you couldnt rely on the exigent circumstances exception or at least it is what it suggested but certainly an assault under utah law is a class b misdemeanor punishable by up to N months in jail and thats certainly of sufficient gravity to justify officers entering 
 any kind of assault i gather its an assault if you are just sort of a couple of guys pushing each other back and forth 
 well under utah law an assault is defined as unlawful force or violence so as to with an intent to do bodily injury now pushing theres not that there now one of the chief problems or primary problems with the utah courts decision in this case is it creates a complicated and confusing bifurcated standard that forces officers unrealistically to choose between roles to choose whether or not they are going to enter and act as caretakers or enter and act as law enforcement officials well the reality first of all its its very difficult for officers to try to make those kind of judgments in the heat of the moment and this is precisely the kind of a the kind of case where that would be impossible to achieve because officers in this case are acting clearly under both roles they are stopping crime and they are also protecting others from harm we want officers to rescue people from harm when they have a reasonable basis to do it not wait until you have to call an emt thats what mincey provides and if there are no further questions i would reserve the remainder of my time 
 let me just ask this one question if i may if you have did the other side preserve the right to challenge this entry under the utah constitution 
 no they did not and and the utah supreme court recognized that 
 thank you counsel general mcnulty 
 thank you mr chief justice may it please the court the fourth amendment does not require police officers to stand by and be a spectator to escalating violence in the home when such an officer has an objectively reasonable basis to believe given the totality of the circumstances that prompt action is necessary to prevent imminent harm 
 so if there were no punch in this case would they have had a sufficient basis N in the morning loud shouting can they conclude based on their experience thats likely to escalate into violence and enter on that basis 
 yes mr chief justice in these facts the government suggests they would the under the fourth amendment a police officer may enter a residence 
 well thats just because its loud suppose they were just singing and laughing 
 well it would depend on if if words are going to be the key 
 one thing leads to another right 
 well thats correct it depends upon of course what those words are its really a combination of the words and the context of the words here you have 
 so there has to be some indication of the likelihood of escalation into violence 
 correct your honor thats thats 
 well why what if they are just so loud that its perfectly obvious they are keeping getting the neighbors are awake and disturbed by it does it have to be a threat of violence 
 well your honor if theres a loud noise alone certainly the neighborhood shouldnt have to be a hostage to that noise and the police officers may be acting reasonably to do what is necessary to end that noise but its going to 
 so then it doesnt matter whats being said 
 so then it does matter 
 but the whats being said may determine may determine whether or not entry is necessary to respond to an imminent threat where a prompt response is critical 
 it may determine what is necessary to prevent harm but what if its not necessary to prevent harm just necessary to prevent noise 
 then it may still be reasonable it may still be reasonable your honor 
 it seems to me the harm inquiry in this case is you know sort of superfluous we dont even have to look at that 
 i agree your honor it may be that the the noise alone could justify the circumstance certainly we wouldnt want a test that excluded words only 
 well no you you dont want to say that the noise alone wouldnt justify going in without knocking as would the a scene of a violent event occurring certainly youd have to knock on the door now if they didnt hear you and the only way to get their attention to stop the noise is to go in fine but wouldnt you have to knock on the door real hard before you went in to stop the noise 
 justice scalia in most cases a knock on the door would would be appropriate thing to do 
 not appropriate necessary 
 necessary 
 well it may very well be necessary depending upon the totality of the circumstances 
 i hope so i mean people 
 yes but we have got a case in which knocking on the the noise is so loud nobody can hear the knock 
 thats why a knock on the door may not always be the right thing to do in some cases it could be a futile gesture in this case the police announced themselves and were not heard because of that tumultuous 
 and they did knock on the door yes 
 they entered and announced their presence and they were not heard when they did that so the knock is is normally the appropriate course but in certain circumstances the knock may either be futile it could be dangerous depending upon what was happening and it certainly could waste some time if it was a dire emergency the under the fourth amendment a police officer may enter a residence without a warrant when a reasonable officer could conclude given again all the circumstances that an impending threat to life or safety justifies immediate intervention and the scope of the intrusion is reasonable in relation to the nature of the emergency whether the officer was subjectively motivated to enforce the law or render aid has no relevance in a constitutional inquiry volatile situations involving violence in the home can escalate in in seconds and the onthescene splitsecond judgment about exactly when the police officers should intervene is precisely what the totality of the circumstances test has long addressed and resolves the balance of the fourth amendment values and this courts recent decision in georgia v randolph contains a clear expression of concern for the need for the police to take prompt action to prevent harm in domestic violence cases in this case 
 this wasnt this wasnt a domestic violence case it wasnt anybody inside calling the police and crying danger rescue me it was an outsider who complained about the noise so i am wondering why you are emphasizing the prevent somebody from being hurt instead of they are disturbing the peace and the police have a right to protect the neighborhood it seems to me that thats an easier argument to make 
 it is justice ginsburg to look at the the threat to the quiet of the community as one aspect of this but the case contains even more the case contains a punch that did some harm to another person in a kitchen setting where there is a strong possibility of escalating violence its the additional facts of that violence that was a potential there added to the noise and the evidence of underage drinking that made the totality of the circumstances objectively reasonable for the officers to 
 well counsel lets suppose you have a police officer who knows theres evidence in this house but he doesnt have probable cause to get a warrant and he also knows that the family is going to be reenacting the murder scene from some movie as part of the family reunion and so hes there just at the time where the in the scene the one guy says and now im going to kill you with this knife and he says ah and he goes in now subjectively we know that he has no basis for fearing violence but a reasonable officer on the scene hearing somebody say im going to kill you with this knife would have a basis for entering so under your test is that entry permissible or not 
 permissible mr chief justice 
 really 
 because there the officer is unaware of the fact based upon the as i understood the facts presented unaware of the fact that that is not 
 oh no he knows he knows he heard this is what they do at the family reunion they always reenact this 
 so he knows that theres no well but thats the difference here between looking at the subjective motivation or what an objective you know officer would understand 
 if the officer has specific information 
 right 
 a fact knowing that this is not truly an imminent threat or necessary to prompt a quick response then that would be a fact in the totality of the circumstances that wouldnt justify but on the other hand 
 so you are saying the objective the the objective officer always knows at least as much as the officers actually know 
 a good way to put it 
 the the officer knows 
 isnt isnt that your standard 
 well if im not sure if i understand the question would you please repeat it 
 yes i i thought you were getting to the point of saying that on the objective test that you urge the officer the objective police officer who sets the standard is deemed to know at least as much as the officer on the scene actually knows in other words we dont exclude information 
 right 
 from our objective test when the officer actually has that information 
 thats correct 
 okay 
 what makes it difficult at times is that you often have two officers one may know something another may not know it and thats why objective information is 
 except i i dont think we look to whether he knew that this was a family reenactment i think we look to the facts that he had that had come to his attention which caused him to believe that this was a family reenactment i mean you know if he had read it in a newspaper or something else the facts are are what matter and not 
 thank you justice scalia thats i agree that that is going to even what the officer believes he knows may be subject to error and therefore the objective test pulls us out of this question of knowing the officers mind and allows us to look at the totality of the circumstances what really was occurring and determine whether or not the reasonable officer would be able to enter constitutionally under those circumstances and here again is the a situation where there was mounting evidence and the court in utah wanted to make the motivation of the officer a significant factor in determining whether or not the officer could enter specifically the court looked to the motive or intent of the officer to render aid as one way to analyze the situation and the government argued that those distinctions or the distinction between rendering aid or entering for a law enforcement purpose is really a an unnecessary distinction because the officer as the counsel for the state has argued is acting in a splitsecond situation seeking thank you very much mr chief justice 
 thank you general mr studebaker we will hear now from you 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court theres two bases or two exceptions which would allow somebody to enter into somebodys home which are before the court today one being the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement the other one being exigent circumstances requirements for the warrant under the facts of this case neither one of those situations apply under exigent circumstances there has to be probable cause to enter and there has to be a warrant to enter and if neither one of those actually under exigent circumstances there has to be probable cause and there has to be the requirement that there be imminent danger basically to evidence or to the person and if theres not exigent circumstances and the officers have an obligation to obtain a warrant based upon probable cause to enter the home 
 what what 
 i thought that probable cause was conceded and i thought that the utah courts didnt question that there was probable cause 
 your honor the what happened was that the utah courts found that the probable cause was there for the emergency aid exception but i believe under the exigent circumstances requirement or the exception that probable cause was not there to get out or actually to get into the home on the situations but even if probable cause is conceded the fact is that the facts of the case dont rise to the level of requiring such as immediate entry into a home to bypass the warrant requirement 
 may may i just get back to your general statement do i understand you to say that if they arrived on the scene and you know a really wild party was going on at N am they knock at the door nobody answers the door they cant hear it for all the screaming and the music and so on that under those circumstances the police could not go in to to quiet things down 
 correct your honor they would actually have to go out and get a warrant to enter the home theres not an exigent circumstance under the facts that you presented which would require them to enter the home and bypass the warrant requirement its not severe enough under those facts 
 lets say they they see a fight going on what kind of calculation do you think has to go on in the mind of the officer they have to think well let me look at these people do they look like they are they are strong enough to really hurt each other how likely is it that they are going to grab some object thats lying around a knife a baseball bat or something and and escalate the violence what what sort of thought process do you think a reasonable officer is supposed to go through in that situation 
 justice alito what the officer is required to do is to weigh the totality of the circumstances and make a decision based upon the totality of what they see and unfortunately these situations are always factintensive based upon whats seen on the scene and in the case presented here before the court none of those facts are presented that that would actually weigh and that was going to escalate into that type of situation the officers actually had personal firsthand knowledge of the events that were happening they stood outside the home they watched the event transpire through the window the exigency was over when the officer entered the home 
 why cant you is there any case or anything that says you dont look at the whole circumstance to decide if it was reasonable to enter i mean suppose i just wrote an opinion for a hypotheticals sake that says look there was so much noise at N in the morning nobody could even hear a knock and he looks in the window sees one of the a kid there being held whos obviously been drinking under age he takes a swing at somebody else and pokes him in the nose and blood starts to run or and under those circumstances of course it was reasonable to go in end of the matter 
 except for the fact your honor i mean the the situation we have is that is it would depend on whether its an ongoing situation or not and in the facts presented here it was not an ongoing situation it ended and then the officer 
 you mean you mean the noise stopped 
 it shortly after the smack in the face by the juvenile your honor the officer entered the home and by his testimony it abated right after he entered the home 
 no the question is whether he could go into the house and are you saying that before he went into the house all the noise stopped 
 it had not stopped no it had not your honor 
 okay so my question is im interested in the law of it why cant i whats what the the constitution says reasonable or unreasonable forbids an unreasonable entry search so this doesnt seem unreasonable a policeman isnt a lawyer he just has to do whats reasonable in the circumstance its a huge well i would be repeating myself but what i want to know is what in the law makes that opinion wrong 
 your honor what makes that opinion wrong based upon the facts that were presented is the fact that the there was no warrant achieved in the situation if the officer is entering under exigent circumstances 
 and there are two reasons why he didnt want to go get a warrant it would take about half an hour at which time all the neighbors are awake and they have to lose an hour of sleep and in addition to that the underage drinking will continue for another half an hour or an hour and in addition to that somebody else might get poked in the nose so those are the reasons why or worse so those are the reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in 
 that may be what he thought not the officer 
 those are the reasons why it was reasonable to go in 
 yes your honor 
 now whats wrong with that opinion 
 whats wrong with the opinion your honor is it still requires a warrant under the situation 
 now suppose i were to say at the end of that it doesnt require a warrant because it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under those circumstances what im looking for you to do is to tell me why 
 your honor the if they are going to enter the home there has to be obviously a serious situation thats going to arise and so with the the presentation which you presented its not serious enough to require the sidestepping of a warrant in the situation 
 mr studebaker im not sure that even the noise wasnt enough to justify what the police did here as as i recall they before they went in they they heard all this noise and they saw the punch they pushed open the screen door and announced that they were the police okay 
 yes 
 and then only went in when nobody heard them then they shouted even louder police im not sure that that just the noise wouldnt be enough to allow that if you cant hear the policeman from the door whos coming to check about a N am noisy party you dont hear his knock on the door can the policeman not open the door and shout police is that an unreasonable search and seizure and then if you dont hear that can he take two steps into the house hes hes not looking under the carpets hes not looking in the desk drawers hes just shouting police so that he can bring to the attention of the people there the fact that theres been a complaint from the neighbors and you have to knock off the noise i i would think thats perfectly reasonable never mind the punch in the nose 
 justice scalia and you asked whether i thought it was reasonable or not and i would say its not the the to bypass that warrant requirement to enter the home under an exigent circumstances which is what they were there for its got to be more serious than a a loud party the situation and ironically the the testimony of the officer which i guess there was a dispute about whether that was there or not because its not specifically in the findings that the trial judge made or the two appellate courts ruled on but if the officer entered the home and shortly after that i mean he opened the door according to his testimony and announced basically raised his voice and they heard him why cannot he have done that outside the home and thats the situation this wasnt a serious enough situation that he couldnt have made the effort to make his presence known outside 
 they didnt hear him when he when he just opened the screen door he had to step in a few more a few more steps then they finally heard him thats his the way i understand these facts 
 and justice scalia he also had to raise his voice and our contention 
 of course he had to raise his voice i mean there was a lot of noise going it just seems to me so unreasonable when a policeman comes to tell people they are making too much noise and the neighbors have complained that he cant do the minimum thats necessary to get their attention so he can tell them that he has to go get a warrant to tell them that the neighbors are complaining about too much noise that just seems absurd 
 yes your honor he would have to get a warrant and and the requirement 
 does it say that in a case somewhere or is that just your opinion 
 its my opinion your honor 
 all right now what i would like to know is what does it say in a case because i i agree at N in the morning it might not appear to many people to be unreasonable when the party is so loud that no one can sleep that they have to take an extra hour or half an hour or N minutes to just tell the people inside the house knock it off now is there a case somewhere that says i guess we could take a poll or something but is there a case that casts some light on this 
 your honor i believe mincey itself requires the the seriousness of the offense be evaluated and further 
 which case 
 mincey v arizona 
 was that involving a is that in this court yes 
 yes 
 and was that involving a party or noise or what was it involving 
 no it was not involving a party or noise 
 no it involved it involved a homicide but there the search in question took place after the premises after the entry after the premises were secured the entry was never in question in mincey 
 correct 
 what was in question was the search after the premises had been secured 
 correct and 
 and i dont see how that helps you because here in the course of securing the the premises they had all all the evidence they needed 
 and and to answer the courts question there is nothing that im aware of where this court has come out and said that a party is 
 so mincey doesnt help 
 correct and so we 
 i mean i wouldnt want this to be the party case this also involves violence and it also involves underage drinking and all three are there together but i guess a policeman where he sees or hears or knows a crime is going on can take steps to try to stop it so that it doesnt have to continue and is there any case that says it depends on how serious a crime is there a case that says if its a sort of minor crime like a disturbance of the peace you have to permit it to continue but if its a major crime like homicide you dont have to 
 i dont believe theres anything that specifically says that your honor no but there are cases out there that say that under the exigent circumstances its got to be a serious situation and the question then becomes is is the situation is the party is the loud noise complaint serious enough to warrant entering into the home and no we would say its not your honor it doesnt rise to that level especially considering the fact that the exigency that the officers relied upon the smack and it was over the situation was already under control 
 well it was it was over until somebody threw the next punch they dont know whats going to happen the next the kid broke away from the four people who were trying to restrain him once presumably he might be able to do it again maybe one of the four who were restraining him might come up with the idea that the best way to stop him from throwing another punch was to throw one at him the the police cannot make it seems to me on the facts in in this record could could not reasonably draw the assumption that there was no risk of further violence am i going wrong somewhere 
 not completely justice souter but we do have a situation where only he broke free from one of the adults not three of the adults he was still under control in this situation and he had gotten his hand free and smacked one of the other adults the one who was the victim in this situation so the officers unlike some situations where they are called out and they wander on a situation the officers in this case had personal knowledge of what was going on they stood outside the home and watched the event transpire and so they really need to wait and observe whats going to happen and wait till the last second before they need to go in in this situation there was nothing that would demonstrate in the facts that it was going to escalate at all 
 you dont you cant attribute what you just said to the trial court and you emphasize the trial courts findings the trial court said about what went wrong what the police should have done as required under the fourth amendment was knock on the door the evidence is there was a loud tumultuous thing going on and that the occupants probably would not have heard him but under the fourth amendment he has an obligation to at least attempt before entering now thats a statement that what went wrong was they didnt knock even though it was likely a futile act do you do you agree that thats a correct statement of the law that what the police didnt do that they should have done was knock 
 yes justice ginsburg they should have knocked they should have made that effort first 
 why isnt screaming police enough i mean as i understand the facts he first opened the screen door now is is that an entry he didnt go in i assume the screen door opens out most screen doors open out he opened the screen door and shouted police now that that doesnt count he has to knock on the screen door instead even though they are more likely to hear him if he opens the screen door and yells police why doesnt that meet the requirement i this why is the trial court obsessed with knocking 
 i dont understand that 
 your honor and i think the reason the the trial court and is concerned about the knocking issue is its if you will the baseline requirement under the fourth amendment under the facts of this case was to make their presence known by knocking 
 no but the as i understand the the trial court he accepted the probability that the knock would be futile and yet he thought as a formality it was nonetheless required a do you understand the trial court to have taken that position and b if it did do you believe that is correct as a statement of fourth amendment law 
 im sorry justice souter i didnt catch the first a part 
 well did do you understand the trial court to have taken the position that even though the knock would probably have been futile the police were required to to make it anyway to knock anyway 
 that is what the trial court 
 and and do you understand that to be a fourth amendment requirement ie no futility exception 
 i do your honor and i know that thats a a complicated issue but its still a requirement but further the court the trial court 
 why should there be no futility exception 
 well even if there is your honor the trial court did not just say that there he the evidence was gone because of the failure to knock the trial court found that the exigencies as well as the appellate courts didnt rise to the level which would require entry into the home 
 well that that may be on your argument that noise is never sufficient to dispense with a warrant requirement but it seems to me that in in the reasonableness analysis that the trial court was going through the trial court was saying even if it would probably be futile it is not a reasonable entry without a knock and and i take it you you accept that and you think the trial court was correct that there is no futility exception 
 i i agree your honor and this is why under i believe wilson v 
 why why should we require a a futile act in the name of reasonableness 
 your honor first it wouldnt have taken any effort at all to follow through on this and even though this court has ruled that you know there is mandatory knock and announce or requirement with some exceptions i dont believe that this is one of those exceptions 
 no one is denying that i mean we have had a knock and announcement requirement for N years 
 correct 
 but the question is do you have to knock and announce when on the facts before you it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock and it will just be a wasted gesture 
 yes 
 why 
 because your honor its our position that its one of the the threshold requirements to protect somebody when they are inside their home is to make that effort 
 but isnt the standard of the fourth amendment a reasonableness standard and isnt there something bizarre about saying reasonableness requires a totally futile gesture 
 that was the finding of the court your honor the trial court that it was futile but again when an officer is placed in that situation to say that if an officer can decide whether something is futile or not that could actually then that exception if we are not careful absorb that rule so i 
 well yes thats why courts review these things 
 correct and that is 
 and if the court says yes based on the evidence before me it would have been futile do you think fourth amendment reasonableness requires the court and ultimately the officer to demand the knock anyway 
 personally yes legally no 
 okay 
 i mean i am not going to try but again this court the the courts below did say that that exigent circumstances didnt rise to the level 
 where did the where did the trial court say that in the findings of fact 
 im sorry your honor 
 im looking at the findings of fact they are in the petition appendix at page N and N i dont see anything that has been specifically identified by the finder of fact as inadequate other than the failure to knock where where did the where does the court say it doesnt rise to the level of exigent circumstances 
 your honor if i look at paragraph N of the joint appendix or im sorry of the of the order it says at that point in time the court finds no exigent 
 where is it where is it 
 im sorry your honor in the petition for cert filed by the state of utah and it would be appendix page N 
 yes but what it says right after that to explain is it would have been sufficient what he what he should have done was knock and that would have supplied all that was necessary 
 your honor and again this isnt the maybe best worded order that the city had prepared in this case when they when the it was actually the city that prepared this petitioners when i look at it i look at two different sentences there there was no exigent circumstances and further what he should have done was knock but further the two appellate courts that heard this matter before did rule on the exigent circumstances because thats what the petitioners in this court had brought before the appellate courts and they found that in both the utah court of appeals and the utah supreme court that the exigent circumstances werent sufficient enough 
 you know maybe maybe you are taking our announce and a knock knock and announce requirement too too seriously or too literally i mean if a police officer comes up and the door is open what does he have to do lean over and knock on the side of the door cant he shout hello police dont you think that satisfies a knock and announce requirement 
 your honor 
 you really think you got to knock even when the door is open 
 your honor under the situation hes got to make his presence known 
 okay and he did that here 
 and 
 he stood at the door he opened the screen door and said police 
 and 
 which he thought would be more effective than knocking on on the you know the the edge of a screen door which doesnt make a very good knock 
 and once he raised his voice though your honor and and made himself a little bit more vocal then they noticed him there and the 
 but they still didnt stop i i read somewhere in the facts that only gradually as each participant in the melee became aware of his presence did they sort of stop it wasnt that as soon as he entered everything quieted down immediately 
 chief justice like you say once they made their presence known it dissipated the the position would be if they can make their presence known inside the home they can make their presence known outside the home and still protect that sanctity of the home that we are trying to insure that people are protected in within their home 
 well there seemed to be agreement that they couldnt have made their presence known because the noise inside was so loud that they would not have been heard 
 thats what the the lower courts have found to be true but justice currently justice ginsburg they found it to be true that the exigent circumstances we are not met under these facts it wasnt serious enough to enter the home without the warrant and i think thats the pivot point where is that line on the exigent circumstances and our position would be that that line that its got to be serious its got to be imminent its got to be an ongoing situation something where somebody is either going to get seriously injured evidence is going to be destroyed somebody is going to flee 
 well was there anything in the facts that a reasonable officer would know from looking in the window to suggest that these the adults were not did not have the intention of inflicting some sort of serious injury on this young man that they were restraining 
 based upon the officers testimony at the suppression hearing your honor it would be that did they not have a serious intention to harm him is the fact that one there was nothing showing that they were actually doing anything more than restraining them that juvenile theres nothing in the record that shows that they were beating on him that they were molesting him or you know 
 they had did they have any reason to know why they were holding him 
 i would say that they would justice alito and this is why you know all that they were saying was they were trying to get the the juvenile to calm down they were trying to get him to settle down this was a situation where the officer testified that at the suppression hearing that there was alcohol involved that there was a minor those types of situations dont demonstrate the fact that this was an ongoing violent situation again and then further the officers were called out for a party they werent called out for a fight in progress or or some type of physical altercation they were called out because somebody had a loud disturbance going on and those facts in my minds eye dont rise to the level and would show the officer especially when the officer is standing outside the home watching this event that theres nothing that that would rise to the level of entering the home under the exigent circumstances 
 the utah supreme court seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the utah protection against the the counterpart to the fourth amendment they seemed to suggest that their own constitution afforded greater protection to the privacy of the home was there a reason why you argued only the us constitution and not the state constitution 
 justice ginsburg i was not the trial counsel below or at the appellate court so i cannot determine what his matter was or what what his basis was for that decision and it then it would appear that you are correct in the fact that the utah supreme court is concerned upon that issue but the fact is that it seems to have been briefed under the fourth amendment has come up under the fourth amendment issues and so thats what we are we are looking at and even though a state obviously can give more protections to its citizens under a state constitution the fourth amendment is still a if you will a baseline requirement and it still applies to federal criminal courts 
 may i ask i dont think the charges are in the record at least i missed them they were charged with what are the charges and how what were the penalty for what the defendants were exposed to theres been no trial they they suppressed the evidence i suppose the proceedings were dismissed were they 
 your honor the proceedings have been dismissed against my clients that is correct and to answer the courts question the charges that they were facing was intoxication no im sorry disorderly conduct intoxication and contributing to the delinquency of a minor 
 what are the penalties for those charges 
 worst case scenario your honor they could be charged with up to N months in the county jail each one consecutive to each other 
 thats the major matter we are resolving today 
 yes your honor 
 what is the actual evidence that was suppressed and to what extent is that evidence that wasnt available just from looking in through the door 
 mr chief justice the evidence was that was suppressed was everything that the officer or officers saw once they entered the home and or or heard once they entered the home basically anything that they obtained once they entered the home the answer to your honors 
 couldnt they have gotten all wouldnt he have been able to testify to all of that without even entering the home 
 they could have your honor however they they did not the prosecutor at the time didnt proceed under that issue im not aware of why he did but what we have though is obviously that that may have happened and as the court addressed previously there may have been then an issue related to the curtilage which would have had to have been addressed or discussed 
 yes but among the evidence they did have were the two two teenagers are drinking beer in the backyard so they pretty clearly had the alcohol they could have gotten that in evidence 
 it could have your honor but i dont know why it did not except for the fact that it could have been built into the curtilage 
 this wasnt kind of constructed as a test case by any chance was it 
 no it was not your honor not at all but 
 well not by you 
 no it was not your honor thats correct what we have your honors is a situation where under the exigent circumstances it did not rise to the level which would require the the officers to enter the home without getting a warrant and in the alternative if they look at emergency aid to enter the home under the emergency aid doctrine which would be the equivalent in our opinion to a special needs assessment then we have to look at probable cause we have to look at their intent to enter because theres no probable cause to enter if they are performing that caretaking role to protect people obviously the ultimate concern in in any type of situation is somebodys sanctity of their home it becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are are being charged to weigh the evidence weigh the credibility of the people who testify and then also take into account the constitutional protections which the parties are awarded and we believe that based upon the facts and the evidence that were was presented that the three different utah courts that heard this matter were appropriate in their in their suppression decisions thank you 
 thank you counsel mr gray you have N minutes remaining 
 just a matter of clarification initially disorderly conduct is a class c misdemeanor punishable by up to N days in jail under the how it was charged here also intoxication is a class c misdemeanor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor is a class b misdemeanor punishable by up to N months in jail so thats thats what but the officers and again this case isnt about what they were ultimately charged with its whether or not they had a reasonable basis to believe that immediate intervention was necessary 
 dont you think the evidence that was available without going in the house would have supported all those charges 
 not the intoxication the intoxication has to be 
 but two teenagers in the backyard were intoxicated 
 the the juveniles but the defendants in this case were the adults inside the home 
 oh they charge that the adults were intoxicated 
 yes 
 well thats a serious crime in utah i guess 
 we anticipated that comment actually 
 and 
 and whats your response 
 normally normally intoxication we think of it as as public intoxication and and thats where its usually prosecuted and where we find it but intoxication that can become an offense where it disturbs others outside of the home and thats what happened here 
 counsel you have you have two questions presented the second is whether this was sufficiently sufficiently exigent to fall under the exigent circumstances but the first was whether the test should turn on the officers subjective motivation i havent heard much about that this morning how is that presented on these facts 
 well the court created two different tests the utah court created two different tests and under the one test it examined whether or not the officers were primarily motivated by a desire to arrest or search for evidence now the court the utah supreme court concluded that they did that they were their motives were primarily law enforcement motives because they did not render aid and this court has repeatedly held that an officers subjective motives play no part in the objective reasonableness test and it should not do so here justice ginsburg you indicated that there was no no suggestion of domestic violence the utah supreme court actually acknowledged that where violence is seen in a home between adults and for example a younger person that there would be reason to believe that domestic violence is possibly present and thats what now the court refused to look at that because there was no finding that the inhabitants or the those involved were actually cohabitants of course this court has never required that officers have a certainty of the situation only a reasonable belief and they clearly have that and in any event whether or not its domestic violence or some other type of violence its something that i believe this court in mincey recognized that officers can and and probably should maybe they didnt go that far but it would be our position that officers should intervene in the face of violence and thats what the officers did here 
 my point was simply that this was not a N call from a distressed spouse this was a neighbor saying they are keeping me up at night so that the the police response was to the noise not to the violence 
 the initial response was clearly to the noise but once the officers arrived it became apparent that there was violence ongoing in the house and thats how the officers proceeded if there are no further questions we would ask the court to reverse the decision of the utah supreme court thank you 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first today in davis v washington mr fisher 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court michelle mccottrys statements here were testimonial for the simple reason that she knowingly told a governmental agent associated with law enforcement that someone had committed a crime prosecutions based on such ex parte statements in place of live testimony strike at the very heart of the evil the confrontation clause is designed to prevent trials on the basis of outofcourt accusations indeed the trial here really cant be described as anything other than inquisitorial in nature the sole proof that mr davis was at ms mccottrys house and assaulted her that day was the N minute taperecorded N police incident interview that the state played at mr davis trial and that it itself described as ms mccottrys testimony on the day this happened 
 counsel when you say 
 how does the fact that its sole proof mean that its testimonial 
 it 
 i it it adds to the general appeal of your case i i suppose but what does that have to do with whether or not its testimonial 
 it doesnt it doesnt answer one way or another whether its testimonial what it does and what im trying to do for this court is first draw back the lens for a moment and look at the kind of trial that we end up with when statements of the like fresh accusations in this case are able to be used in place of live testimony 
 but you did use the word inquisitorial and theres one large difference it seems this is not a magistrate judge or a police officer coming to a person for an interview this is initiated by the caller by the victim and its initially a cry for help 
 let let me address that question in two parts the first part you have mentioned justice ginsburg is whether it matters that the that the operator is not a police officer and we submit no 
 no i didnt say that 
 im sorry 
 i said that the call was initiated by the victim it wasnt a a police officer coming to interview her 
 i see well we dont believe under the proper conception of the confrontation clause it matters who the accusatory statement is initiated by certainly we believe the confrontation clause should apply if ms mccottry had simply walked out of her house and walked down the street to the police station and voluntarily walked into the sheriffs office and said i want to report what mr davis just did what we what we suggest here today is theres no difference if she simply calls on the telephone to a N operator which the state itself in its brief calls a conduit to the police and so when the when the police and when the state have set up a system for people to report calls more expeditiously im sorry report crimes more expeditiously we dont think the answer is any different 
 you are splitting up two things that i think go together that is this is not just a call this is a cry for help 
 well there in in a sense of course ms mccottry is seeking help at the same time shes reporting a crime but the the mere fact that the two are intertwined does not take us outside the confrontation clause of course in the indiana case that you are going to hear you are going to hear the same thing that the person is asking for help in the same way so when somebody makes a call which we might call a mixed motive or a dual purpose call the question that we think this court should ask is whether whether thats the kind of a statement first of all that historically would have been viewed as implicating the confrontation clause and if you look at the hue the old hue and cry practice that we have referred to in our briefs sir matthew hale in his treatise explains that when somebody went and got the local constable what they were doing is they were seeking help first and foremost to apprehend a felon and more than that they were also reporting the crime in the first instance 
 is it your argument that any statement made to law enforcement is testimonial 
 well you certainly dont have to go that far in this case your honor but but we believe 
 i thought thats what you said in your argument when you started off 
 certainly any statement describing criminal activity to a law enforcement officer would be testimonial 
 well you started out by saying that the purpose of the confrontation clause was to keep out the accusations made out of court but i would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay rule and if thats the purpose of the hearsay rule how does the confrontation clause differ 
 the purpose of the hearsay rule justice breyer is to police the reliability of outofcourt statements what this court said in crawford is the confrontation clause is something much different it regulates the manner of taking testimony in criminal trials 
 ah so its not the purpose of the confrontation clause to keep out outofcourt accusations only some and which and whats the rule 
 well we believe the rule is is that any accusatory statement to a law enforcement officer or to an agent of the law of law enforcement 
 i know you do believe that but i want to know why in terms of the purposes of not the hearsay 
 well the 
 rather the confrontation 
 the history of the confrontation right going back even prior to the framer was to bring the accuser and the accused face to face so that the accuser made his or her accusation in the presence of the accused and subject to cross examination and the very heart of the confrontation clause which this court has said itself over and over again is to require the accuser to to deliver the accusation in court and so accusatory statements those that say he did it this is what happened this is what i saw are different than ordinary hearsay and and i to take an example from that we talked about in the crawford argument justice breyer when somebody says pass the pass the pewter urn from the mantle thats where bob keeps the drugs thats the kind of a statement that is very different than pointing the finger at somebody to a law enforcement agent 
 suppose i point the finger in an affidavit and i just send the affidavit you know i i dont want to get involved im in a foreign country i sign my name i even do it under oath and i send it right to the judge thats trying the case not to a law enforcement officer to the judge you dont think the confrontation clause would cover that 
 absolutely justice scalia i 
 so your your thesis that it applies to just accusatory statements to a law enforcement officer has to be expanded a little 
 it does and what im giving you is a a rule that i think is the kernel the heart of the confrontation right you dont have to say much more than that if its 
 well what about what if you what if somebody runs out of the the house there are two people standing in the yard a law enforcement officer and the nextdoor neighbor she yells at the nextdoor neighbor hes trying to kill me and then he comes out is that covered by your rule its not to a law enforcement officer its to the nextdoor neighbor but the law enforcement officer overhears it 
 i think statements that law enforcement officer merely overhear may not be testimonial and one of the reasons for that is this courts bourjaily decision which it cited with approval in crawford is if somebody make if somebody makes statements that tend out that turn out to be incriminating in a criminal case the mere fact that they are overheard by law enforcement officers or even an undercover officer eliciting the statement is in a different scenario mr chief justice than somebody making a statement to law enforcement or even and i want to make sure i understand your hypothetical if the person realized that a police officer was standing there and hearing what she was telling her neighbor we may then have a testimonial situation but in this case what we have is not simply a blurting out or a cry for help in fact ms mccottry never asked for help she said she didnt need an aid car what we have are a series of N questions that the N operator asked ms mccottry that established every element of the crime the court im sorry that the state ultimately proved 
 what was she calling N for if she didnt want help 
 well 
 i mean she she wanted something from N what did she what did she want did she want the police to come over and arrest her husband was that or 
 i think thats a fair inference justice scalia of course we dont know because she was never shes never herself submitted to cross examination but there are mandatory arrest laws in the state of washington she had a nocontact order against mr davis both of which a reasonable person would understand that a call for N would be tantamount to a call for arrest 
 you said you said we dont know but you thats slightly in conflict with what you said earlier they asked N questions how long was this telephone conversation between the N operator and the victim 
 its about N minutes justice ginsburg and its not what we submit is of course we have given you in the joint appendix the structured protocol that the N operator was following in this case and we submit that its not mere happenstance that the N call was able to establish every element of the crime right down to mr davis birth date that the prosecutor referred to in her closing argument that the N operator elicited from ms mccottry and indeed the only question 
 well i thought that was i thought that was to determine if there were outstanding orders and warrants against the individual 
 it may be and that may be another example mr chief justice of a of a 
 but thats related thats related to sending people to prevent crime as opposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict 
 i dont want to dispute that N operators in this situation just like responding officers are gathering information for dual purposes they may well be trying to resolve an ongoing threat of a felon at large at the same time of course all of the information and training manuals that we have provided to you in the reply brief make it clear that from the initial contact with the alleged victim they are gathering evidence all the while and in fact the only thing you can think of at least i cant think of a single question that a prosecutor might have asked at a trial that the N operator didnt ask here the only questions that really immediately come to mind are ones that might have been asked in cross examination for example 
 well what if the only question what if a N caller says nothing more than in a very excited way someone is attacking me send a police officer right away to make the person stop attacking me is that testimonial 
 to the extent that the person is saying someone is attacking me that kernel may may well be testimonial justice alito however if somebody calls N and says please send help to N main or N main street that may well not be testimonial and that a mere cry for help and this goes to justice ginsburgs question as well a simple cry for help may may not be testimonial 
 but a simple cry for help that doesnt say im being battered may not elicit an immediate response on the part of the police this kind of call i need help now and the information that comes with it is likely to be given priority attention as this very call was 
 i think thats a fair inference but the the priority attention in terms of going and apprehending mr davis is exactly what triggers criminal justice system and exactly what makes the kind of a statement the one that the one that the confrontation clause should care about 
 do you have any 
 well they are not sending someone they are not sending someone to apprehend mr davis they are sending someone to prevent him from attacking his wife 
 im not sure its easy to separate one from the other mr chief justice the way that they are doing that is by arresting him they have a mandatory arrest law in washington that says that the way that the police must respond to a call like this is to arrest 
 may i ask this question i i guess in an awful lot of these cases theres a mixed motive protection and enforcement is it your view that whenever theres a mixed motive it becomes inadmissible 
 no justice stevens its our view that you really ought not be looking or focusing on the police officer motive or on the governmental agents motive for the very reason that you start to get into these knotty questions of what exactly were they trying to accomplish and we believe a better a better default than if you cant simply answer it by looking at history and precedent is to look more towards the declarants reasonable expectation and thats what this court does in the fifth amendment when it 
 well in doing that do you distinguish for example between the the expectation that lies behind a merely excited utterance on the one hand and the expectation or lack of expectation that would qualify that would be the case in a in a true res gestae statement in the very strict sense so that you know if if the attack had occurred N minutes beforehand and and the victim is saying on the telephone to the police adrian is trying to kill me that would be that that wouldnt would not be admissible i take it on on your view under the confrontation clause and yet if in the course of the N call adrian was battering the the you know the victim over the head with something and she blurted out the same statement hes trying to kill me would the would the latter be admissible in your case 
 the latter 
 under your theory 
 im sorry 
 im sorry i misspoke on your theory 
 the latter is a very close case justice souter i think you are right insofar as it it can be important to distinguish between a modernday excited utterance and what would have been considered a res gestae type statement at common law certainly if you take away the N call from your hypothetical and she says please dont hurt me adrian that may well be the kind of a statement that would be inside the res gestae once somebody picks up the phone to call N that by my reading of the historical cases turns it into a report or a narrative 
 so that the answer to my question is there would be no distinction between the merely excited utterance N seconds later and the utterance in the course of in in my hypo 
 we believe that as long as it is making a report to a third party there ought not be a distinction now of course you dont have to wrestle with that in this case because 
 you say according to your reading of the cases but you really dont have a case like this you you have a case where after the fact the the victim went to a constable or to some other official to report the event and perhaps to seek help against the person who but you dont have anything where really in the course in the course of the attack or or while the person is still at least under threat a a constable is is called do you 
 well justice scalia of course we didnt have telephone technology so 
 you could have you could have somebody walking by a policeman walking by outside 
 yes 
 and the victim shouting you know please somebody help me harry is beating me you dont have a case like that so so i dont know why we should flop one side rather than the other on this on this case that that doesnt seem covered by by the old jurisprudence why should we go your way on it and say that it it falls within the prohibition rather than say it falls outside the prohibition 
 well for two reasons justice scalia one is we do have the hue and cry scenario that we have talked about 
 yes but thats not this case 
 and we think the fair 
 that 
 its not exactly on all fours with this case but we think the fair inference when you read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds of statements were kept out is that if they simply if the police or their agents were able to get the statement just a little bit sooner the answer would have been the same and we do have cases justice scalia where people made fresh accusations or cryouts to private parties to to another to a witness who wasnt even associated with law enforcement and we have a whole section of our brief pointing out that for decades after the founding even those kinds of statements were kept out of evidence in criminal trials for the reason 
 because of the because of the confrontation clause you think 
 well i i think its a fair inference justice scalia from reading the historical precedent and the treatises that describe it they they describe these as in in a sense secondclass testimony they say the problem with statements like this if they are made even seconds after the event in place is that they are at that point they are nothing more than a narrative and require us to give credit to a statement and this is the words the treatise writers used to use that was not given under the ordinary tests for determining the accuracy of testimony and when they used the word like testimony and they talk about the usual tests and the customary way of testing outofcourt statements i think the fair inference is they are referring to the right to confrontation perhaps another way to think about this is to take a step back and say what if we decide that statements like this are not testimonial the practical the practical impact of that is not simply that these statements wont will come in but that prosecutors and prosecutors federal and state government will have no incentive whatsoever to ever bring N callers into court it it is across state hearsay law across the country these are deemed excited utterances so if this court were to say 
 well thats not thats not true at all i mean if if the the witness may be a good witness and compelling on the stand they may have every incentive to bring her in in person this is only addressed to the situations where the witness is unwilling or unable to testify 
 mr chief justice i think you got to the heart of the matter when you said that if its a good witness the prosecutor will put them on the flip side of that is that if the witness isnt so good the prosecutor would have every incentive at least not to put them on the stand why would somebody put on a stand put somebody on a stand that doesnt seem perhaps credible or maybe subject to impeachment when they have in a sense testimony in a sealed tape recorder already 
 well i assume the defendant could summon that that witness if if that witness location was known no 
 well the defendant 
 and could find out from the prosecution where that witness was i assume 
 the defendant might be able to do that but of course that would treating the case this way would collapse the confrontation right into the compulsory process clause the confrontation right is a right not to be able to bring witnesses into court its to be confronted with the witnesses against 
 but justice scalias question raises the the point the reason these witnesses are not there is not because of anything that the government has done its its the concern they have the particular domestic abuse situation its not the government that is keeping these witnesses out they are not relying on the N calls as a matter of preference 
 well mr chief justice i think your assumption may not be entirely correct theres a theres a portion from for example the san diego prosecutors office decided and i believe in the nacdl brief that says oftentimes they do prefer to to leave the witness off the stand because they have a better case just using the the excited utterance type statements 
 is there is there suppose the defendant procured the witness absence by a threat 
 yes 
 then the N statement could come in right 
 thats right thats right and perhaps and this gets back to the chief justices question as well it helps maybe to separate these kinds of cases into three categories we first have the category that the prosecution would prefer not to put the person on the stand we think there the confrontation clause ought to require them to do so we we next have the category where the defendant as you say procures the witness absence we dont dispute that in that scenario the forfeiture doctrine kicks in which this court reaffirmed in crawford we dont have any forfeiture question in this case and then we have perhaps the gray area where a witness goes missing through no fault of anybodys and this court has said over and over again that there the confrontation right puts the onus onto the prosecution 
 but those are those are three neat legal categories the practical reality is it not so is that many women in these situations are scared to death of what will happen to them or they are so insecure financially that they think they have to put up with the battering so your neat legal categories really dont conform to what happens in peoples lives who are in this situation 
 justice ginsburg i dont want to be insensitive to to witnesses in this situation of course reluctant witnesses is nothing new but but in domestic violence its an acute problem however we believe the proper way to deal with that situation is by this court developing its forfeiture doctrine the sixth amendment applies across the board to all criminal cases justice ginsburg and we have cited for example in the appendix to our reply brief about N cases from the last couple years that have been handled in a victimless fashion like this that are not domestic violence cases 
 how would you do that how would you do that forfeiture 
 pardon me 
 how would you do that im interested in that because i thought it sounded good then i thought about it i thought to have forfeiture youd have to show that this defendant in fact forced the wife not to testify its a crime to do that so youd have to prove another crime against the defendant in order to prove the first crime and i thought perhaps that doctrine is not very practical you tell me why it is 
 well thats already what happens under the federal rules of evidence and under the evidence of many states that there is a rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing and so 
 i understand that my point is that to prove the wrongdoing would probably be even harder than to prove the original crime all we know is the wife isnt there 
 im not 
 and we suspect that shes afraid of her husband he may have offered to cut off financial aid said goodbye no money or he may have done worse im just saying you are telling us that because the prosecution can prove that in court and only then will it be able to introduce the testimony given beforehand by the missing wife 
 well i think 
 how does it work 
 well i think we have justice breyer like in lots of other scenarios you have a pretrial hearing and at that pretrial hearing of course the rules of evidence dont strictly apply the way they would in the guilt phase so in this very case if you look at the joint appendix when when on the eve of trial ms mccottry is no longer going to show up for trial the prosecutor says i want to subpoena the jail records and i want to talk to the victims advocate to find out whether shes been intimidated or kept away so the prosecutor herself tells the court how shes going to look for this evidence if she had found anything presumably she would have presented it and she could have presented it that way and its 
 maybe we should just just suspend the confrontation clause in spousal abuse cases instead of designing the entire application of the confrontation clause everywhere on the basis of what seems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases 
 well of course justice scalia the sixth amendment says all criminal prosecutions 
 i understand 
 and domestic violence cases are criminal prosecutions so we dont think 
 and i suppose we could also have said that the sixth amendment like some other amendments doesnt apply to state prosecutions 
 thats right but we have 
 or the confrontation clause portion of it anyway 
 yes 
 which would exempt spousal abuse cases by and large until we until we enact a federal spousal abuse statute which which may well occur it seems to me there there are better ways to to solve this problem than to design the whole confrontation clause jurisprudence on the basis of what happens in spousal abuse cases 
 i think thats a fair comment and let let me say there are two there are many ways that you can do that justice scalia and two of them were readily available to the state in this case one is even when a witness goes missing or is unwilling to testify in a hard case there may well be other ways to prove the case here the caller said 
 this is true but the reason i thought spousal abuse cases are relevant 
 pardon me 
 a reason i thought they were relevant is just what you are about to address they are evidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring something within the confrontation clause prior to crawford even though it was within the clause if it fell within a wellrecognized exception to the hearsay rule it could come in so you could bring in coconspirators before the conspiracy ended you could bring in for sure excited utterances you could bring in all kinds of things that now no matter how reliable you have to keep them out 
 thats right justice breyer but 
 and so that is a problem that you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly narrow line and i want to know what that narrow line is with spousal abuse and other cases in mind 
 let me give you two ways this case if if we assume the states version of events is correct could have easily been proved one is that the caller said that a man named mike was at her house during the entire event when the police showed up at her house some N minutes later they never even got mikes last name and of course justice breyer the reason why is because they were probably thinking of the roberts framework and that they wouldnt need this witness but good oldfashioned police work would have presumably found a witness that witnessed the whole event that they could have put on the stand the second thing the state could have done in this case is they could have filed the case in a way that they obtained a preliminary hearing if what the state says is correct that ms mccottry was cooperating up until the last minute thats a classic scenario where by way of having a preliminary hearing and subjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary hearing they could have preserved her testimony this court in california against green and roberts itself said that those kinds of prior pretrial cross examination scenarios are good enough to satisfy the confrontation clause and if the court has no further questions i will reserve the remainder of my time 
 thank you mr fisher mr whisman 
 mr chief justice may it please the court in this N call the operator asked a short series of questions nearly all phrased in the present tense each question was objectively and reasonably necessary to respond to an apparent emergency 
 like what is his name i mean thats the present tense not what was his name or what will be his name what is his name you think thats the present tense so that shows that this is all seeking help 
 no a number of other questions justice scalia were answered were asked in the present present tense too and in fact the operator shortly after asking the first questions one of the first things that she said was help was on the way and then continued with a series of questions but as the interview continued of course every single question and every single answer was captured on the tape for a jury or a judge to later hear the call ended after the operator knew that ms mccottry had her door locked that davis had left and that the officers arrival was imminent we ask respectfully ask this court under these circumstances to hold that the use of this powerful evidence without live testimony from the declarant was constitutionally permissible 
 you know powerful is part of the problem this this kind of telephone call evidence is even more powerful than than the kind of a signed affidavit that used to be banned because it was testimonial i mean to hear to hear the voice on the phone makes it if it is if it is impermissible under the confrontation clause it makes it even a more damaging violation than the kind of violation that that occurred in in sir walter raleighs case for example 
 well id respectfully disagree your honor although id id first note that that i think the if clause in your honors question is telling and i think if that that doesnt necessarily define whether its testimonial or not but to address 
 would you would you rather put the woman on if you had a choice would you rather put the woman on the stand 
 absolutely your honor and and 
 rather than have her her voice on the telephone call 
 well if i had to 
 when she is she is in in supposedly in great fear of of her husband and and im sure youd rather have the telephone call 
 if you are asking me which would i chose 
 as a prosecutor 
 well if i had to chose that would be a difficult choice obviously but our plan of course was to 
 i think it would be an easy choice 
 our our plan was to do both and it wasnt until the eve of trial that we learned that the complaining witness ms mccottry wasnt going to appear and i think that the circumstances 
 did did you subpoena her at that point 
 she was already subpoenaed your honor and the prosecutor brought in the detective the detective attempt made numerous attempts to get a hold of her checked her last known address the person there didnt know where she was we had one phone number for her she wasnt responding to the telephone calls pursuant to our calls to that number so we made a number of efforts that are documented in the record to get her to court once we learned that that she didnt appear now at that point 
 counsel your your position is not that anything that she says or anything anyone says in a N call is is consistent with the confrontation clause 
 thats right your honor its conceivable that you could have statements made in the course of a N call that wouldnt be testimonial 
 so what is your what is your test we have your friend saying any accusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer what what is your proposal 
 our focus your honor is as i think this court focused in crawford on whether or not the governments practice resembles the inquisitorial abuses in other words did you have in the modern sense did you have a structured police interrogation such that the interrogator or the questioner might have in some way shaped the witness testimony 
 mr fisher tells us thats exactly what happens that the N operator goes through the elements of the crime in a very structured way 
 well i i think if you listen to the tape itself you will conclude thats not the case i mean in fact each question that the that the operator asked was reasonably and objectively designed to facilitate a quick response and to solve the emergency that was apparent 
 lets lets not overread crawford crawford didnt say that the only thing the confrontation clause was directed at was the kind of abuse that that occurred in the case of sir walter raleigh it said that that was the principal abuse at which it was directed i doubt very much unless you think otherwise that if somebody without provocation from the police wrote up an affidavit signed the affidavit and gave it to the police i doubt whether that would have been allowed under the confrontation clause do you think it would have 
 well it may not have your honor but the under the test that we are proposing the we are placing the focus on situations like this situations roughly analogous situations that are distinguishable from what you had with sylvia crawford and i think that although although our test may not cover every conceivable hypothetical i think that as this court recognized in crawford defining testimonial was going to be a a task that was going to take some time and 
 your test wouldnt cover the example i just gave 
 yes right thats right your honor our test would not 
 and you think that that should be admissible in a criminal trial 
 no i dont i think it 
 well 
 that should be inadmissible but it should be inadmissible because of the rules of hearsay and i think in most states in the union it would be inadmissible i cant think of a hearsay example that would permit it 
 oh now the person disappears afterwards is unavailable 
 fair enough but its not an excited utterance its not a present sense impression i cant imagine a hearsay exception that would admit it which is really what brings us back to the core of our theory too and that is that that under the confrontation clause as defined in crawford we now have an absolute rule covering a finite 
 i cant imagine that that wouldnt have been covered by the confrontation clause 
 well 
 such such an obvious violation of your right to confront your accuser and just because it was presented to the police without without an initial interrogation by the police i dont think that would have made any difference at common law 
 and and your honor it may be that at some point the court expands the definition in in crawford of testimonial formalized testimonial materials to include something like that but i think that in situations where you have an encounter between police and citizen and statements result then i think its fair to focus on the interaction and whether or not the the person was trying to shape the testimony 
 i agree that thats the extreme but you are urging us to to adopt a test that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the hypothetical i just gave you and you you can accept that hypothetical without saying that you lose this case but it seems to me the test you are proposing is is really quite extreme 
 well your honor as i say the test we are proposing i think would cover the majority of cases the hypothetical that your honor posed was is is itself i think somewhat unusual we we do not get statements of that nature we do not see them being offered into evidence and as i say i think that if if we saw cases like that if we saw statements that were admitted there may be other ways under the clause that the court could interpret the confrontation clause to exclude them im not arguing for the admissibility of that evidence quite frankly i have never in my life even seen a piece of evidence like that offered all im saying is that i dont believe it falls under this narrow definition of the confrontation clause that you outlined in the crawford case 
 why dont you incorporate what the solicitor general has suggested that is you draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are calling for for immediate help 
 we certainly dont have any objections to the solicitor generals approach your honor and and in fact in some ways because we are analyzing a case like this that arose in an emergency circumstance i think that its clear that that statements that are made in those circumstances just by their very nature arent going to be testimonial people dont testify in an emergency we chose not to take that approach doctrinally just because we didnt think it was as closely tied to the approach the court took in crawford but i think its certainly consistent with the strategy outlined by the solicitor general 
 what what do we do about the about the fact which i dont think you you deny and and the the other side points out in both of these cases that in fact police departments have their responders to the N number intentionally ask a series of questions that gives them all the information they need to conduct a prosecution in other words they are using N as a as a prosecutorial device 
 well i think that overstates the empirical evidence your honor i think that if you look at the training manual in this case that we attached to our briefing in the supreme court and refer to our briefing if you look at the way that this interview was conducted its clear that these operators are not as a routine matter using the N process to develop evidence in fact in this case you will note that that after the short N minute period the operator didnt say well stay on the line with me a little bit more and lets talk about the background situation here and she didnt do that because her training as documented in the training materials from the valley communications center said dont get caught up in the background information that led to this event because it can distract you in getting the information that needs to be transferred to the police department right away and i think that that is a perfectly reasonable and really the the better approach for a N operator so even though 
 did did she wait until after the N minutes to call the police or did she she have the police on the way after the first minute 
 it sounds as though that she dispatched them immediately your honor because 
 she shes just typed that out on the computer or something like that 
 thats right and in fact there are some times when you can hear all three voices on the N tape not in this instance but as i said almost immediately after the call began she said help is on the way thats because you can dispatch but still obtain information for example the date of birth and as mr chief justice indicated date of birth of the defendant and name et cetera are extremely important so that in those N minutes that it coincidentally it was also N minutes before the police officer arrived they can be determining whether or not the defendant has criminal history they can determine whether or not from their records available to them in their police car whether or not the defendant has a history of assaults against police officers whether or not he has a a history of carrying weapons et cetera so thats all information that the operators are trained to to obtain and then to transfer to the police as soon as possible 
 and shes shes in ongoing the operator is in ongoing contact with the people shes the operator has dispatched right 
 correct your honor and thats why thats why ordinarily the operator doesnt terminate the call until the police have arrived on the scene here it appears that she terminated the call somewhat contemporaneously with their arrival she she indicates that the police are there and they will look around for him quickly and then come and check her 
 what do you have to say about the failure to inquire about mike 
 your honor i i dont think thats as significant as petitioner suggests if you look at the record in the pretrial testimony of officer jones he asked ms mccottry upon arrival repeatedly did she know who this other person was and her answer was she didnt know the persons last name the record isnt fully developed on that point but it sounds like that that mike was a friend of the defendants and we know for sure that mike left with the defendant i think its reasonable to infer he also came with the defendant but we didnt have any particular contact or handle on this person mike and in fact if it was a friend of the defendant youd think that the compulsory process clause would have given the defendant some basis on which to bring him before the court i dont think that that includes any of the that that doesnt somehow shift the burden on the defendant in the same way it might if were to force him to bring the declarant in if he knew mike he he certainly had the ability to bring mike in so i dont think its as significant as petitioner suggests your honor i i do want to return for just one moment to this notion that we dont want witnesses to testify and that we are satisfied with proceeding just on on the basis of other pieces of evidence at least in my practice and at least in our county thats definitely not true in fact even if we have a recanting witness in for example the domestic violence abuse scenario situation it is often just as effective for us to go ahead and put put the witness up on the stand let her tell whatever story shes presently telling and then play the N N tape also in conjunction with the testimony of the officers who can describe what what condition she was in when they arrived and i think when you juxtapose the N tape even with the recantation from the witness frankly sometimes the jurors find it even more illuminating than than if she didnt appear so we do not spend our time trying to put together cases purposely without the victim testifying it just so happens that sometimes at the last minute like this case we are not able to bring the person in but i think 
 how how often does this happen in other words are we being asked to in effect on your part to to recognize or to derive a special rule for cases which at least numerically are sports 
 your honor i do i cannot answer in a percentage terms how often this happens but you know that you have a reluctant witness in domestic violence cases is a is a not unusual occurrence in any event but i dont think that 
 but but im talking about the witness who is not merely reluctant but simply doesnt show up and you make reasonable efforts and you and you cant find the witness how often does that happen 
 as i say im im hard pressed to give a a percentage number but its not as i said 
 has it happened to you before 
 i believe it has 
 but you dont know how many times 
 i cant say no your honor i cant say i think its maybe happened once to me but 
 so we are not i take it we are not in a position whereby if we hold against you we are in effect nullifying the possibility of enforcing domestic violence laws by criminal process 
 well i i think the other factor that has to be considered your honor is as soon as soon as defendants realize that merely pressuring the victim into not appearing will put an end to the case then it gives the defendant the increased incentive to put the pressure on the victim and cases that otherwise would have pled wont so i think it will have 
 disappearing not just not appearing disappearing 
 yes i 
 thank you counsel 
 thank you your honor 
 mr dreeben 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court a panicstricken call for help which can occur on a N call is not a form of bearing witness within the meaning of the confrontation clause that activates the rule in crawford emergency statements statements that are made to N operators and to officers at the scene investigating an urgent need to protect a persons safety do not resemble the classic forms of testimonial evidence that were generated under the marian statutes and the civil law practice that formed the impetus for the confrontation clause in three significant respects statements that are made in emergency questioning differ from the kind of testimony that prompted the rule in crawford and the confrontation right that it rests on first of all in the classic examples of someone giving testimony which this court noted means a solemn declaration or affirmation for the purpose of proving a fact people who are on N calls or seeking help at the scene of an an urgent situation are not making statements for the purpose of providing evidence in a case they are making statements for the purpose of obtaining help and that distinguishes them significantly from the kinds of subtle desires to shape and influence their statements that occur 
 well maybe i mean its easy to imagine a N call that doesnt fit your description you know the person is trying to get in the door the call is you know this is the fourth time i keep calling and i have talked to you about this you dont do anything hes got to be locked up so this will stop i mean thats not that sounds more like testimony than an immediate call for help 
 mr chief justice we would distinguish between those kinds of N calls where someone is seeking protection from an imminent or present threat to their safety and a N call thats making a more generalized report of criminal activity or a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a narrative form about the past 
 well the husband had left the house here as i understand it when this when this call occurred 
 actually justice 
 she she wanted the man arrested but he was no longer in the house was he 
 actually justice scalia i believe when the call begins the caller is speaking in the present tense and says hes here jumping on me again and the N operator then begins to elicit information to find out what is the level of the threat to her safety and what actions need to be taken and says okay i have got help started help is on the way now tell me what his name is and she the the caller tells what the name is of the defendant and at that point says hes running now and so its only after critical information is imparted at the beginning of the call that the caller says that hes leaving but even 
 and then what whats your position if she says he beat me N minutes ago hes left and hes running down the block 
 i think in that situation justice kennedy there is still an imminent threatened potential of a recurrence the person could come back theres no protection on the scene the reason that shes calling N and not a friend or or a health care provider is that she believes she needs protection right then and the the nature of an emergency is such that it exerts a pressure both on the person who is seeking help as well as the official responder from the government to solve that urgent problem any evidentiary benefit that may come from that is really an incidental 
 well suppose suppose its a thief and she said hes taken the diamond necklace and hes running and hes running away we know hes not going to come back 
 that that situation would not fall within the emergency rule that the government is arguing for today what we are arguing for is a rule that deals when peoples safety is 
 so the the jewelry store owner who reports to the the police is fleeing on a N that thats not thats not admissible under your view 
 no im not saying that justice kennedy im saying that the court isnt confronted in this case with a situation in which threats not to the person but to property or the need to obtain or try to apprehend a fleeing felon are present 
 well what what about the my hypothetical 
 we would submit that that is not testimonial within the meaning of crawford for many of the same reasons that that are present in this case but it is a different case from this 
 what do you mean by seeking help i mean it seems to me you are saying seeking help means trying to get somebody arrested trying to get somebody who has harmed you arrested in this case he was gone out of the house she had gone and locked the door before she came back to the phone and gave most of this testimony 
 well 
 and and in the in the jeweler case the guy is running down the street what is the jeweler is the jeweler really worried about the guy turning around and coming back to rob some more he wants the man arrested 
 the urgency certainly in in the jewelry thief hypothetical does deal with apprehending the person who has just stolen the goods and thats why i say that it falls outside of the rule that the government is arguing for today but justice scalia i think 
 but im concerned about the rule you are arguing today because it it seems to me theres a good case for allowing the the statement by the jewelry store operator 
 i think there is a good 
 and and i want to know what your position is so that you dont come back next week and say well now we want the jewelry store 
 well im not going to say that we wouldnt depending on how the court analyzes this case argue for a submission that thats not 
 wed rather you analyze the case now and then we will analyze it later 
 what the court needs to analyze today is whether an emergency statement where somebody is seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent recurrence of the very violence that has triggered the call is testimony and its not testimony because the sort of risks of government shaping and the declarant focus on providing evidence for use in a criminal case are not present and the information has as justice scalia pointed out a unique probative value thats very different from the kind of submission of an affidavit or submitting to a civil law deposition that prompted the confrontation right the framers were thinking about things that we all would recognize as testimony being deposed submitting an affidavit appearing before a a magistrate in a pretrial proceeding and they used the word witness in the confrontation clause not only to refer to the kinds of statements that were covered but in connection with knowledge that the same word appears in the fifth amendment and in the sixth amendment compulsory process clause where in all of those contexts its most natural application is to the formal acquisition of evidence 
 what do you say in that respect about the blue briefs reference to N th century cases the hue and the cry where someone went out and told the sheriff help im being beaten up and that that evidence wasnt admissible 
 well i think whats really striking justice breyer is that there is no N th century case law that reflects that theres really a virtual complete absence on the other side of this case of an affirmative argument supported by decided cases that says that evidence of that character was even known to the framers let alone excluded if you look closely at their constable cases which is the closest cases that they they submit one of them is a report from the old bailey online source which contains transcripts of criminal trials in in england and one of them the radbourne case is right around the time of the framing and theres a little line in the transcript where the constable says well i bent down and i asked the victim something and then the judge says well dont say that theres no evidence that that was regarded as a a legal ruling under confrontation principles theres no evidence that the framers were aware of the radbourne old bailey report and theres additional statutory basis in the treason statute which was applicable there which said that all evidence had to be given face to face so thats their primary authority their next authority 
 well its its it may be not a lot but its something you dont have anything to the contrary 
 what we have 
 you dont have anything which shows that these hue and cry reports were admitted and there were a lot of them they they were done regularly 
 the hue and cry reports justice scalia as i think your earlier questioning suggested do not necessarily involve the kind of emergency situation what that we have here where a person is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal act against them and seeking help and the fact that we have very little evidence at all of how N th century british law handled this is really i think persuasive evidence that the court should not deem the confrontation right as a response to some sort of abuses in this area 
 i would say that a hue and cry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and and picking up the phone while the crime is in progress but i think its quite similar to the the jewelry hypothetical that justice kennedy gave you which you are unwilling to say is is not covered by the is covered by the confrontation clause and i think its quite similar to a woman where the husband has left and shes locked the door and she wants the husband arrested i think its quite similar to that but for the telephone its its someone whos been the victim of a crime who goes to a public official as soon as possible and says i have been i have been subject to a crime i want to report the crime and have the person arrested i think its very similar 
 justice scalia first of all there is evidence that the hue and cry practice existed there is not evidence about how hue and cry reports were viewed as a matter of evidence law it is very difficult to transpose into N th and N th century english practice what we are dealing with now in part because the system of public prosecutions that we have today where an official prosecutor representing the state carries the ball in a criminal case did not exist the accuser had to appear in court as the private prosecutor if the accuser did not appear there was no prosecution and these prosecutions were simply dismissed because there was no one official on the scene to carry the ball so the the speculation thats required requires a number of inferential leaps that petitioners have to make in order to draw an analogy and at the same time there really is an intuitive difference between the kinds of statements that people make in emergencies and the kind of core testimonial statements that we know prompted the confrontation right the sir walter raleigh case involving affidavits and letters the marian practice under which testimony was formally taken in the calm of a magistrates rooming house rather than in the immediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually ongoing 
 mr dreeben you say focus on the emergency nature very little of what took place in the N call is emergency hes beating me hes jumping on me yes whats his name i mean its not like they will send help if his name is joe but they wont if its mike it doesnt matter which direction is he running thats not related to the emergency nature of the of the call 
 it is mr chief justice in the sense that its information thats needed to respond to and resolve the imminent threat to this womans safety which would certainly occur if the individual decided to come back and finish what hed started and if a law enforcement authority set up its N calls so as not to gather adequate information and this individual had come back and actually beaten or killed the victim it would certainly be regarded as an inadequate response to the emergency situation of an ongoing violent attack and so for that reason the rule that we are describing here for the court would deal with not only the present emergency but also its imminent threatened recurrence 
 well rather than build that into the law it might be wiser to deal with justice kennedys case in whatever system we come up with explaining it so what is your full explanation of the diamond necklace 
 my my view on that is that the kinds of statements that are made in the immediate report of a crime are really in the form of excited utterances that are much different from the kind of dispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that prompted the confrontation right now the court could accept that line and say that jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the meaning of the confrontation clause or it could disagree and say that no when theres not the immediate threatened imminent potential for a recurrence of the violence then we are going to treat that as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat it as testimonial court could go either way on that without touching the core of whats at issue today which is namely emergency situations that pose a threat to the safety of the person whos making the call or whos encountered by a law enforcement officer on the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack 
 and you wouldnt say that every question asked in that context dont we have to do it question by question i mean what if one of the questions was you know has he beaten you before how many times before you know are you going to allow that in too 
 i think that 
 as an excited utterance 
 the more that the the questioning begins to delve into a past narrative of past criminal activity the more there is a reason to think that it serves in addition to its protection purpose an evidentiary purpose id hasten to add justice scalia that that kind of information is very important for the officers to know to gauge the seriousness of the threat to get the kind of idea of who they are dealing with and to respond effectively so it is reasonably necessary for those kinds of questions and that information to be elicited but i also agree with your honors suggestion that not everything that occurs in a N call should be regarded as per se nontestimonial not everything that happens at the scene of a crime should be regarded as per se nontestimonial and naturally the court is going to have to apply a certain degree of analysis to the actual questions and answers that are given but if you look at the protocol in this case for the N call if you look at the kinds of questions that were asked and the information that was given it is all reasonably necessary to resolve an emergency by a person who has really called in a state of extreme stress thank you 
 thank you mr dreeben mr fisher you have N minutes remaining 
 thank you let me say a word about the record and then two things about the emergency exception that we have been talking about first in the record its always been accepted in this case that mr davis had left the house when the N call started in the joint appendix page N thats what the washington supreme court said and at page N of the evidentiary hearing in the trial court the prosecutor submitted the case that way as well now let me address the history here because its important and justice scalia is exactly right theres not a single case historically where a statement to a law enforcement agent accusing someone of a crime was admitted in a criminal case we are not aware of one 
 that may be hearsay that may all be hearsay 
 it it is what it is justice breyer the the oldest case that is in the briefs on the other side is white v illinois in N so for some N years before that and and perhaps when we have to draw an inference we do have to a certain degree we acknowledge the dog that doesnt bark we have evidence that was out there and simply wasnt used lets look at the history of the marian statutes and im and i want to refer the court specifically to page N of sir matthew hales treatise he talks about the both the problem with the hue and cry and then the reason we have the marian statutes the reason we have the marian statutes was because for pretrial bail and committal hearings the courts were not prepared to simply go on the initial reports they wanted a formal examination of the witness to use at even the pretrial hearing to detain the person pending trial and sir matthew hale at page N says the problem with the fresh reports the hue and cry is that is that they are not under oath they dont they dont even answer all the questions that we would want answered so what the united states is asking you to accept is that the kind of evidence that the framers would not have even been prepared to allow at a pretrial bail hearing rather they wanted to have something more formal they would now accept to be used in the trial itself and what we think is that this turns everything on its head the reason the marian statutes were abused is because of course in continental europe that was an accepted form of evidence and so there was some reason to believe these formal statements could be used no one ever suggested the hue and cry could be used finally let me say a word about police incentives if you accept the rule that the that the united states and and the state is asking you to accept think about the incentives you put on N operators they are not supposed to ask too many questions they are not supposed to get too much information the same would go for the responding officer they dont want to ask too many questions structured questions make sure who did it make sure they have the details because then somehow these statements become testimonial what our rule says is it frees the N operators it frees the police officers to do what they are supposed to do which is immediately start responding and both help people and start gathering evidence from the moment that a crime is reported and thats what we think the confrontation clause is all about its not its about the way the case is proved at trial the confrontation clause as opposed to other emergency doctrines this court has in the fourth amendment area for example the confrontation clause has zero to say about the way police officers do their jobs or the way the N operators do their jobs if they go out and collect structured affidavits under oath if the N operator put the caller under oath theres nothing wrong with that if the N operator says i want to be sure i have this right describe to me exactly what he looks like and tell me more about him thats what we would want somebody to do and we shouldnt put a perverse incentive for these first responders that all of a sudden once they start gathering useful information for the criminal justice system that some sort of new rule triggers all we are saying is that these are the kinds of statements that were that the framers would have cared about and that they did care about and that nowadays if the state or other prosecutors want to use them they should be dutybound to bring the witness into court as well to submit the witness to cross examination if there are no further questions i will submit the case 
 i have one last question how do you think professor wigmore would have decided this case 
 well this court noticed that professor wigmore had the view that the confrontation clause applied only to witnesses that actually took the stand so he would have thought the confrontation clause didnt apply at all but he would have acknowledged to you and this is interesting from his treatise that these were testimonial statements he said as soon as somebody starts as soon as in a criminal trial we use a statement narrating a past event its testimonial however professor wigmore just didnt quite have the confrontation clause right 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in lopez versus gonzales and toledoflores versus united states mr long 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court a drugtrafficking crime is defined in N us code section N as any felony punishable under the controlled substances act or two other federal statutes punishable is a key term if that word is omitted the remaining phrase any felony under the controlled substances act clearly refers to felony violations of the controlled substances act the parties agree that punishable means subject to criminal sanctions so a drugtrafficking crime under N is conduct that is subject to being punished under the controlled substances act state felonies are not themselves punishable under the controlled substances act it is not a federal crime to violate state law the defendants conduct may be punishable under both federal and state law but a official state felony is not a felony punishable under the controlled substances act 
 well do you agree that if there were a state conviction for an offense that would have been punishable under the federal law their both being felonies that enhancement can apply in that instance and that that does meet the definition 
 yes justice kennedy our position is if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the controlled substances act or one of the other two federal statutes it then is a drugtrafficking crime under N us code section N and therefore it is an aggravated felony but there are three additional textual indications in addition to simply the felony punishable language that misdemeanor offenses under the controlled substances act are not drugtrafficking crimes under section N the first one is there are other provisions of section N and where congress actually used very similar language it referred to conduct punishable under the controlled substances act or the two other statutes or offenses under the controlled substances act or the two other federal statutes but then it added an express reference to state offenses so official 
 where 
 the implication is that when congress meant to include state offenses it said so 
 where are those sections 
 the you can find them they are in the appendix to lopezs blue brief justice scalia 
 okay 
 and the provisions on and N begins on page N a of the appendix and begins on N a and you can pick up is on N a is on N a 
 what are the sections 
 they are subsections and 
 all right 
 well that doesnt carry too much weight though because the provision that im looking at violates any state law relating to any controlled substance can be broader than whats punishable under the federal controlled substances 
 it 
 act 
 it is a bit broader mr chief justice but if you look at all of these provisions the implication is clearly that congress was referring to official state law when it meant to include state law i mean the if you looked at for example there its a parallel construction its not broader i think perhaps the government would say well we are talking about offenses thats a little different from a felony but offenses is actually a broader term i will mention an additional statute which was not in the appendix N us code section N this provision its a similar provision it defines a serious drug offense as an offense that is punishable under the specific sections of the controlled substances act or an offense under state law that had the offense been prosecuted in a court of the united states would have been punishable under the csa an additional textual indication is its agreed and this court has already said in gonzales against the united states that a drugtrafficking crime under N under the criminal statute must be a federal crime N refers to a crime that may be prosecuted in a court of the united states and that clearly refers to a federal crime the definition of drugtrafficking crime by its term says it is for purposes of N so there is no reason why congress would have wanted to include state felonies in a definition that applies to a federal criminal provision official that all concede applies only to federal predicate offenses and 
 in 
 the governments interpretation would significantly broaden section N to include federal misdemeanors 
 in N usc N what in your view does the first phrase illicit trafficking in a controlled substance add to the reference to a drugtrafficking crime 
 justice 
 as defined by N 
 justice alito in our view illicit trafficking means any offense that has a trafficking element that is distribution possession with intent to distribute manufacture 
 but are there any trafficking offenses that would not fall within N if you define a trafficking offense that way 
 yes they are most offenses under the controlled substances act are trafficking offenses there are a few that are simple possession there is a daterape drug that i will not try to pronounce but its listed in N usc section 
 well no there official 
 N 
 are possessory there are mere possession offenses that are outlawed by N but is it not the case that any if you interpret trafficking to mean trafficking in the way the word would be used in ordinary speech that any state trafficking offense you can think of would have a corresponding felony violation under the controlled substances act so that if you read the statute that way the initial phrase is superfluous 
 i believe the government has a footnote in their brief where they suggest there are some state trafficking offenses that actually do not have a parallel in federal law soliciting i think may be one of them so i think there are in fact some and our position of course is that by adding illicit trafficking any trafficking offense state or federal whether or not it is punishable under the controlled substances act is an aggravated felony 
 let me ask the same question a different way if since N includes some mere possession offenses and illicit trafficking in a controlled substance includes all violations of N doesnt that show that the way congress used illicit trafficking in a controlled substance is not in the sense official in which the term is used in ordinary speech buts much broader so that it can include mere possession offenses 
 the justice alito there is an argument its developed in the brief of the american bar association that because illicit trafficking is the general category that all the aggravated felonies in this category should have a trafficking component and therefore the felonies punishable under the controlled substances act that are simple possession offenses should not in fact be included that is not an argument that we have pressed in our brief we read the phrase to say illicit trafficking including any felony punishable under the controlled substances act so i would agree with you to the extent that if it is a felony punishable under the controlled substances act congress has said by definition that it is included in the category of illicit trafficking 
 but thats ambiguous thats perfectly ambiguous because the case of your client it is a felony and it is punishable under the controlled substances act 
 well justice breyer it is a misdemeanor under 
 no thats official 
 the controlled 
 right but it is a felony under south dakota law and what the statute says and thats the governments argument they say any felony punishable under the controlled substances act they dont mean necessarily any felony punishable as a felony under the controlled substances act 
 well 
 it might mean anything that is a 
 but 
 felony and 
 but 
 it is also punishable in which case you lose but in the first case you win 
 but you know 
 so what am i supposed to look to to decide which is 
 well you could look to the case of jerome against united states which is which was a unanimous decision of this court in which the court held that the just the phrase any felony 
 uhhuh 
 in the federal bankruptcy statute should be interpreted to mean any federal felony so official 
 oh but you dont mean that because you are prepared to concede at least i thought you were until your last argument you are prepared to concede that if a person engages in a crime that is punishable as a felony under south dakota law and it is also punishable as a felony under federal law under N et seq well that counts 
 well but i mean the government 
 do you 
 accuses us 
 do you concede that 
 the 
 or not 
 the government accuses us of making that concession 
 no no 
 but we 
 you 
 really dont 
 you say your answer is you dont make the concession 
 we really dont i mean we concede that if the i mean N N the criminal statute says nothing about state law it says nothing about any conviction under federal or state law its simply a official question of whether the conduct is punishable capable of being punished under the controlled substances act 
 but i thought that 
 the federal statute 
 was the concession you made in response to my 
 well 
 question 
 yes i but i just want to be careful about the language in which we make 
 but you 
 this concession 
 make the concession as i understand it because its a federal felony not because its a state felony 
 right 
 isnt that right yes 
 is it 
 precisely 
 is it if this is an ambiguous statute do you what mileage do you get from barrett there is certainly an argument that what was congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of saying if there is analogous felony if there is analogous crime under state law that should be included official and that made good sense 
 yes if its ambiguous and you look to the legislative history i think we get considerable mileage from barrett the congress was pretty clear that what it was doing was codifying barrett the barrett approach which was then followed by the bia for more than a decade was that they would count state drug crimes but only if they were felonies under the federal statutes under the controlled substances act so i think we get considerable mileage out of that 
 what 
 you have 
 about the 
 answered justice breyer by citing the jerome case after jerome we decided united states vs gonzales having to do with the consecutive or concurrent sentencing terms and it are those two cases in some tension gonzales didnt mention jerome and i noticed that none of the briefs mentioned it either is there some tension in the cases and if so is this a case where when we write an opinion whatever the outcome we should talk about that and if thats so what should we say 
 i dont see any tension gonzales was just about consecutive versus concurrent sentences official under state versus federal law i mean the court has applied that principle 
 but it does 
 for example in taylor 
 it does seem to limit the broad statement in jerome without mentioning jerome 
 well but i mean with respect justice kennedy i dont see how it limits it and there have been other cases taylor is an example where the court adopted a single definition of burglary for purposes of N that applies the jerome principle i mean its a principle that has been applied in a number of this courts cases 
 but has it ever been applied in a to a statute that specifically says that the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law 
 well 
 that would seem to me to be a very express legislative repudiation of the jerome 
 well 
 principle 
 when we get to that language mr chief justice and i do think it helps the analysis to official first decide what is the definition of a drugtrafficking crime under N the criminal statute once you have decided that now when you move back to the ina there is this language the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in N whether in violation of federal or state law or the law of a foreign country now we think thats pretty straightforward it has to be an offense described so the simple example is money laundering it the offense described in N us code section N money laundering is an aggravated felony so a violation of state law or of foreign law can be an aggravated felony but only if it is the offense described in N if states or a foreign government has a broader definition of money laundering that cant count because its not the offense described and when you turn to a drugtrafficking crime the way that offense is described in N is congress picked up in its entirety and without any modification the definition of drugtrafficking crime in N a felony punishable under the controlled substances act so if you agree that in the criminal statute that means a felony violation of the controlled substances act the offense described is the felonies in the controlled substances act not the felonies in the misdemeanors and state if state law wants to call a official something thats a misdemeanor under federal law a felony they can do that but they cant expand the offense described the offense described the way congress did that is 
 but are you saying it would also include state trafficking offense because its described in the word trafficking 
 yes im focusing on the definition of drugtrafficking crime it also theres the illicit trafficking piece of this and i should add any state offense that is illicit trafficking is going to be an aggravated felony we recognize that if there are no further questions id like to reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you mr long mr crooks we will hear now from you 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court i would first like to address the governments contention that mr toledofloress appeal is moot his appeal of his sentence is not moot primarily because he is still subject to the sentence that is the subject of that appeal even though mr toledoflores was released official from prison on april N st of this year and deported to mexico hes still subject to the supervisedrelease portion of his sentence because supervised release is not automatically extinguished by deportation 
 but theres no supervised release of people outside the united states 
 theres no supervision of people outside the united states mr chief justice but he is still subject to the jurisdiction of the district court and still subject to the conditions of supervised release that are not dependent upon supervision 
 well like what 
 well for example he shall not excessively use alcohol he shall not associate with persons who 
 whats going to happen to him if he does that 
 if the district court learns about it he could be violated he could be extradited back from mexico and he could face up to a year more in prison 
 has anything like that ever happened before with people subject to supervised release who are then deported it would be the first time if the district court did that right official 
 there have been instances in the case law where people on supervised release have been extradited back from foreign countries based on violations of their supervised release but the point is under the statutory scheme mr toledoflores is still subject to the district courts jurisdiction the district court retains jurisdiction to modify his supervised release to change the conditions or to cut the supervised release if the district court learns of a violation and a violation warrant is filed within the supervisedrelease period then the supervisedrelease period is effectively tolled and the district court 
 and that 
 retains 
 that period has how many months to run 
 until april N th of next year your honor 
 do you you said you rely primarily on that argument do you have another argument 
 yes we do your honor after april N th of course in accordance with this courts decisions in spencer v kemna and lane v williams the court needs to look for a collateral consequence of the official thenexpired sentence and in this case we point to the possibility that a retrospective reduction in the term of imprisonment which of course will not give excess prison time back to mr toledoflores but even to reduce the number of the sentence on paper could be a favorable factor for him to get a waiver of inadmissibility should he ever want to get a nonimmigrant visa in the future to come visit his uscitizen children 
 we have a case involving standing which says that you know the doctrine of standing is more than a an exercise in the in the conceivable and this seems to me an exercise in the conceivable nobody thinks your client is really you know abstaining from tequila down in mexico because hes on supervised release in the united states or is going is going to apply having been deported from the country for criminal offenses is going to apply to come back in the these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable this is just not the real world 
 well my answer to that justice scalia is that this court has never said that an appeal of a sentence may become moot before that sentence is expired and in cases like lane v williams and spencer v kemna the sentences were completely expired and official therefore the court had to look for collateral consequences of the nowexpired sentence here in consequence in contrast mr toledoflores is still under the sentence which is a direct consequence 
 that depends on whether you consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he leaves the country if the sentence is one of supervised release which is impossible once he leaves the country supervision being impossible supervised release is not a realistic consequence of the prior conviction 
 but that argument could be made with respect to a person who is in the united states who is subject to a term of probation where the only condition is that he not further violate the law in that 
 well no because 
 instance 
 in that in that instance action can be taken against him if he does further violate the law under the terms of probation the point is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or the district court doesnt extend to mexico 
 well thats true but if we are talking about future violations of the law it is very often the case that persons who are deported to mexico do come back and do have their supervised release official 
 well 
 revoked 
 you dont want to say that your case is not moot because your client is going to violate the law again in the future 
 no not at all your honor but im saying that in the respect that you just talked about for the us citizen its not any different that the court retains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release and to revoke it and then to send him back to prison 
 no but it is different in the respect that he would first have to violate the law by entering the united states 
 that is true but in most cases that is the only violation of supervised release for which they are later revoked and in that respect it would be no different from a person who violates his probation by driving while intoxicated or committing some other legal violation 
 do you work in 
 on 
 this area 
 on collateral consequences do you have what is your best authority to say that in it would keep this case from being moot official 
 we cited in our reply brief at page N your honor the hamdi case united states v hamdi from the second circuit where the second circuit found that the possibility of reducing the term of imprisonment even retrospectively could have an impact on the ability to get a waiver of inadmissibility in 
 because 
 the future 
 because the length of the sentence counts heavily in the attorney generals assessment is that 
 thats correct your honor in hamdi they pointed out that the length of the sentence goes to two of the three factors that are evaluated by immigration officials under a decision called matter of heronka that are used in evaluating whether a person should be granted a waiver of inadmissibility in the discretion of the attorney general 
 do you think theres a realistic possibility that this person is going to be readmitted a realistic possibility 
 i do not know your honor hes 
 oh 
 got us citizen 
 do you think theres a official realistic possibility hes going to try to get readmitted so that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised release 
 well i think that there is a possibility that he he could qualify for a nonimmigrant visa at some point 
 has he applied for such a visa has he expressed any intention to apply 
 he has not your honor but he does have uscitizen 
 well 
 children 
 then its an exercise in the conceivable it seems to me 
 but this court has never held that a it would be unfair to hold that an appeal of a sentence can be moot while that sentence is still in effect and when it can still have consequences for mr toledoflores and thats what distinguishes this case from all the other cases decided by this court is that the sentence itself is the concrete and continuing injury that defeats 
 may i 
 mootness in this case 
 ask this question its official presuming supposing we say its not moot and you prevail could he be resentenced without being present in court 
 yes he could your honor we do resentencing in absentia all the time in the southern district of texas 
 in the southern 
 in circumstances that are similar 
 in the have you ever heard of or had a client or heard of a person from mexico who had been deported because he has been involved in drugs and the government wants to bring him back because he may be a witness maybe something develops some other members of the gang are there theyd like his information 
 that does happen occasionally people are paroled then to testify in court proceedings or to cooperate with federal 
 so if 
 or state 
 they pick up some friends of his who are engaged in drugs the government might decide to try to get him back 
 thats correct your honor official 
 is there any indication that thats in the works or is this just another conceivable thing 
 there is no indication in the record 
 yes 
 that that is in the work i do want to point out that 
 well its conceivable i guess that people will break their parole often it doesnt happen sometimes it does sometimes they want to get him back sometimes they dont 
 thats all very true justice breyer i wanted to point out that in campo serrano which we have cited in our brief this court held that a deported aliens probation term was a continuing criminal sentence that saved the case from mootness and the court pointed to the fact that he that the deported alien in campo serrano could just like mr toledoflores have his conditional release revoked and he could be reimprisoned upon a finding that he had violated his conditions and we believe that campo serrano points very strongly in the direction that this case is not moot on the merits i would just like to point out official that the interpretation that is advanced by the petitioners here promotes the very sort of uniformity that this court has found desirable in cases like jerome v united states and its progeny including taylor v united states in that the same conduct of conviction will have the same immigration and same federal sentencing consequences irrespective of the labels or maximum prison terms affixed by the particular states that set out that conduct and 
 thank you counsel 
 thank you 
 mr kneedler 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in order for a state drug offense to be an aggravated felony under section N of the ina two there are two requirements the underlying conduct must be punishable under the controlled substances act or one of the other specified federal statutes and it must be a felony because petitioners underlying conduct here was punishable under the controlled substances act and was a felony under state law they are they were properly official found to have committed aggravated felonies that conclusion follows not just from section N but more importantly by the fact that what is relevant here is what is the meaning of N which is the operative provision which just happens to incorporate the definition of drugtrafficking crime from N and there are three features of N with 
 why dont you say it just happens i mean 
 no no but no but yes no its 
 its there in the statute 
 its im sorry 
 thats why you are here 
 it expressly incorporates it yes yes but the but the operative provision is section N of the ina and there are three features of that that we think reinforce this conclusion the first is that the consequences of aggravated felony status under the ina turn on whether one is convicted not whether they have committed the crime and thats true both with respect to the enhancement of sentences under N and the and the immigration consequences and we think it makes particular sense when you are talking about a conviction to look about how the to look at how the official crime is treated under the jurisdiction of conviction 
 i thought the government has taken the position and as far as i know all the courts of appeals have bought the governments argument that there you do not need a conviction 
 you do 
 that so 
 not need a conviction under section N if you are bringing a prosecution under section N 
 yes you dont 
 you do not you do not need a conviction but in order the immigration consequences 
 yes but 
 have been 
 but N is incorporated in N its 
 right 
 incorporated so you want us to interpret N one way for criminal convictions a criminal sentence that is you dont need a conviction in order to get the enhancement but another way for 
 no official 
 for the ina 
 our point is not that N requires a conviction when its in the immigration act its that the immigration consequences of that incorporation turn on whether someone was convicted of an aggravated felony 
 why is 
 so 
 that 
 well the ground of deportation that refers to aggravated felony refers to someone who has been convicted of an aggravated felony the ineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony and the enhanced penalties under section N for someone whose illegal reentry following aggravated felony is for a conviction for an aggravated felony so my point is that under the ina the consequences turn on conviction and it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction here state law to see whether it to look at the to determine the status of the crime and since state law determines it to be a felony thats the 
 mr kneedler 
 proper place to look official 
 if there is room for more than one construction of this statute it seems to me unseemly in the immigration context to say that two people who have committed the identical acts one of them is barred from ever coming back doesnt have any of the dispensations and the other does because of the happenstance of the state in which they were convicted that kind of disuniformity in an area where the constitution expressly charges congress with authority to make uniform laws its doesnt that uniformlaw specification in the constitution tug in the direction of the interpretation that mr long was 
 no we 
 presenting to us 
 we think it does for several reasons first with respect to the constitutional requirement the uniformity provision applies to uniform rules of naturalization that is citizenship this we are not talking about citizenship here we are talking we are talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in the country beyond that even where the uniformity clause applies and theres for example a parallel uniformity clause for bankruptcy thats never been interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct under state law can have no impact on bankruptcy law and official that there cant be a variation the statelaw homestead exemption under the under the bankruptcy laws is a good example of that but going beyond that with respect to the issue of uniformity generally congress has established uniform standards in section N either in terms of identifying the conduct in certain instances in other instances by identifying the minimum sentence that was actually imposed in this case we think with respect to drugtrafficking crimes it its imposed a uniform standard in terms of the length of the sentence it has to be a felony thats that is uniformity but the to answer your point more directly it is a principle throughout N that one looks to state law not to not to a some supposed uniform standard of federal law and for example if you several subparagraphs and if you will N is set out at page N of the appendix to our brief three subparagraphs and refer to the sentence that may be imposed for a violation well when you are talking about a state conviction thats clearly referring to the sentence that may be imposed under state law for a conviction four other subparagraphs and turn on the sentence that was actually imposed that means that in the case of a official state crime as we have here that state law has to authorize the sentence and that the state court applying state sentencing principles has actually imposed a crime of for of at least N year so it is it is infused in section N that in fact you do look to the consequences of an offense under state law 
 im prepared to accept perfect ambiguity here linguistically and i thought of an empirical question that you may know the answer to that might shed some light now going along the way maybe im making a mistake to point it out if i am but i go to the key thing here which is the words in N what is a drugtrafficking crime a drugtrafficking crime is a crime any felony punishable under the controlled substances act that could mean an act physically that is a felony under some law and is also punishable under the controlled substances act as a misdemeanor okay felony under it could pick that up and it also could mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the controlled substances act and i could look at those words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means so i thought of an empirical test this statute N happens to be a statute that if you engage in a drugtrafficking crime as defined and you official have a gun with you you get mandatory N years thats the point of it and the government does all the prosecuting so in how many cases where a person committed a misdemeanor offense simple possession and had a gun did the government insist that they get the N years minimum now if you are prepared to tell me a lot of em im prepared to tell you the government has consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now but if you are prepared to tell me zero i would say i would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along now for the first time and my mind is open on it im quite interested in the answer 
 to my knowledge we have not brought crime prosecutions under N based on the circumstances you posit but thats 
 but if 
 but i dont think that that goes very far with respect to answering this question for one thing as this court pointed out in the gonzales decision the requirement that there be a federal crime and therefore a federal felony under N comes from the language in N that says that the crime must be subject to prosecution in a court of the united states and this court in gonzales said its that language that renders the renders it a requirement that official it be a federal crime the definition of 
 no no we both agree all everybody agrees here it doesnt have to be a federal crime 
 it doesnt have to be 
 and 
 under N 
 correct it doesnt have 
 right 
 to be it could be conduct that violates the state law but and punish it under the state law but the conduct involved would have to constitute what is a felony under the controlled substances 
 would have to 
 act 
 in our view it would have to constitute 
 a felony or a misdemeanor 
 it would have to be punishable under the controlled substances 
 yes 
 act 
 all right 
 but the important point here is official 
 all right so i say its suspicious 
 but the question is not what N means standing alone or in the abstract its what it means as incorporated into N and 
 and of 
 there 
 course thats when you get to that it must give you pause that your analysis is of a term drugtrafficking crime or illicit trafficking and your theory leads to the conclusion that simple possession equates with drug trafficking 
 well the petitioner has conceded as i understand it i heard mr long i think concede that possession offenses can constitute aggravated felonies under this provision that there is the recidivist possession there is the possession of the daterape drug there is possession of N grams or more of cocaine all of those are specified as being of being felonies under the under N or N but beyond that its important to take into account that a lot of state statutes dealing with drugs do not are not patterned directly after the federal statute and theres official no reason why congress would have insisted that they do so in order for this statute to operate sensibly and one notable example for instance is when it comes to possession of a substantial amount of drugs that that certainly would create a strong implication that the defendant was engaged in trafficking activities or intended to the federal statute deals with that by making it a felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug a number of states dont do that they instead have graduated possession offenses based on the quantity of drugs that the defendant is possessing that above a certain quantity of drugs it would be a felony they are getting at the same problem but they have come at it in a different way 
 then in those cases you can say the conduct would constitute a felony under the federal statute but here if i recall correctly the amount involved would not have qualified for possession with intent to distribute under federal law 
 well it would always be up to the jury to decide that now in mr lopezs case he was he was initially charged with a series of offenses that went beyond the aiding and abetting of possession that he ultimately pleaded guilty to but as he testified in his official in his immigration hearing his aiding and abetting of possession was assisting someone in purchasing drugs which was itself a trafficking element and so this shows that the way the state crimes are defined or applied are often getting at what federal law 
 yes we have a case in which we are assuming for our purposes we just have possession i mean i understand the facts of this case and i wanted to ask i have two questions mr kneedler one of them the second one id ask that you were going to mention three different points one about conviction you had two other points you didnt get to i want to learn what those were but before that it seems to me that when you put the whole statute all the all the different statutory provisions together you really boil down and focus on N and the words for purpose of this subsection the term drugtrafficking crime means any felony punishable under the controlled substances act and if the word federal had been inserted before the word felony in the statute would that not make the statute perfectly clear 
 it probably would but i think its interesting that the version of N that was in effect prior to N said exactly that it said felony violation of federal law official 
 it was a question of 
 it was it was explicit 
 whether the change was intended to be 
 well but 
 substantive 
 congress 
 or merely 
 but 
 stylistic 
 congress did change it in the N act but it did it and this is significant it did it in connection with two changes in the immigration law one is the enactment of the definition of aggravated felony which as i have explained the definition of aggravated felony looks to state law in a number of respects in terms of the severity of the offense or the punishment actually imposed that was one change the other change that was made in the N act was to amend section N with respect to illegal reentries and it did that by enhancing the penalty for conviction of any felony other than an aggravated felony and an aggravated felony and certainly the conviction of any felony includes state law offenses in this official 
 just again mr kneedler focusing again on that specific language you are saying in effect that that phrase means any state or federal felony punishable under the federal statutes 
 it says yes it says any felony and that is our doing it and what 
 and is it ever true that a state felony is punishable under a federal statute 
 the conduct is 
 yes i know but 
 punishable the conduct is punishable not 
 but do you know of any instance where we have said a state felony is punishable under a federal statute 
 i think not i think not used in that sense but i think its important its important to look at the language as a whole it does not say punishable as a felony under 
 but you do agree 
 under the controlled 
 that the key to the case is how we read that one sentence 
 well no i agree that the i in my view the key to the case is in N official because if you look at the structure of N and this gets to the question you you said you mentioned that i had three reasons one is that under the under the ina the conviction consequences turn on the conviction of an aggravated felony and it only makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction to determine the nature of the crime whether its a felony 
 well but you dont you dont look to the jurisdiction of conviction are you telling me you require a conviction you i thought you told me you dont require a conviction 
 no under N you dont but under the under the if you are bringing a federal prosecution under N the term aggravated felony has no role in that determination it is a it is a separate federal crime we are talking about here the consequences of the consequences of being an aggravated felon under N are where does the definition of aggravated felony apply it only applies under the ina if someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony you are only you are only subject to deportation for aggravated felony if you have been convicted you are ineligible for cancellation or removal you are subject to sentence enhancement all those things follow on conviction and we think it only makes sense to look to official the jurisdiction of conviction that is 
 all right mr kneedler assuming that as i understand it the answer you just gave your second point as well as the point that you and justice stevens were debating turns in your view on a definition or a reading of the statute that would work this way that if under state law the act were a felony but under federal law the action was merely a misdemeanor it would still for purposes of this definition be an aggravated felony 
 thats correct 
 that isnt that very strange that congress would have wanted a reading of the statute that would turn its definition of a misdemeanor crime into an aggravated felony for purposes of the immigration law 
 i dont think so at all and for one for one thing as i have mentioned the structure of the act as a whole of N and there are numerous subsections look to how the crime what the authorized punishment was or look to how the person was actually sentenced under state law not under federal law 
 no but im 
 and i 
 saying if official 
 no i 
 no go ahead 
 i also havent mentioned the explicit provision that one of the other justices mentioned earlier i think the chief justice that the penultimate sentence of N says that something a an offense constitutes an aggravated felony whether in violation of federal or state laws 
 well 
 so 
 i know it says that but that doesnt necessarily take you any further than saying that if the words of the statute refer to something that could be a state law felony under the under the penultimate sentence it will count it does not necessarily answer the question that we have and that is whether a particular reference in the statute is a reference to a federal felony or a state felony so it has a the penultimate sentence has work to do and in fact we can see the work being done in the in the very definition of drug trafficking but it doesnt necessarily lead to the conclusion that you draw from it 
 well we think we think it is quite a we think its a strong confirmation of the pattern in N that the statute looks to what official happened in state court and the state punishment that was authorized there and the express mention of that or 
 even when 
 requirement 
 the consequence in effect is to turn for turn the gravity of the federal misdemeanor into the gravity of 
 but the 
 a felony that 
 the federal controlled 
 just happens to be a state felony 
 the federal controlled substances act does not occupy the field of drug control in the country any more than any other federal crime occupies that field and 
 no i realize that but if we are asking what is important in the mind of congress for purposes of the immigration law one would suppose that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way federal law deals with it ie in the case of a crime whether federal law calls it a felony or federal law calls it a misdemeanor you know in your reading when federal law calls it a misdemeanor if state law calls it a felony it becomes a federal felony for the immigration official law and thats what seems to me odd 
 right and this is not the only place where that consequence can arise there are there are cases involving whats a crime of violence which is which under subparagraph is another aggravated felony the crime of violence is defined in N usc section N subsection of that this court considered that statute in leocal requires that the offense be a felony which creates a serious risk of physical harm the courts have looked to the state law of conviction to determine whether something is a felony 
 mr kneedler could 
 yes but 
 under that provision 
 may i just ask one 
 sure 
 its one thing to turn to state law to get an answer where there is no other answer the problem here is that state law and federal law are at odds in determining the gravity of the offense the federal law on my hypothesis would say it is minor its just a misdemeanor the state says no it is a felony it seems to me very odd given the tension between the state and federal classifications to say that for federal purposes the state classification is going to trump the official federal classification and thats a different situation from the one you posit 
 well and if i could just mention one other on other example under the theftoffense category in subsection i think its where a theft offense is deemed to be an aggravated felony if a sentence of at least N year was imposed there are misdemeanor offenses there that as a matter of federal law it can be a misdemeanor for certain types of theft offenses and yet they are covered as aggravated felonies and again that would 
 mr kneedler could i ask you about your assertion that you look to the state of conviction what do you mean by that for purposes of N does that mean if you are convicted in state court of a misdemeanor and even though that action would be a federal felony its not an aggravated felony 
 that is our position yes because the requirement the 
 so its sort of a double inconsistency not only do you treat state state actions that are that are minimal im sorry where the state treats it more seriously than the federal government not only do you follow the state but where the state treats it less leniently than the federal official government you also follow the state 
 well and 
 is that right 
 yes and we yes we think thats 
 so you look to the state of conviction what 
 thats 
 thats for purposes of the immigration law 
 of the immigration law and again we think that 
 okay now do you do the same for purposes of the felony enhancement provision 
 N no you dont because 
 you 
 the aggravatedfelony question has no has no the aggravated felony term has no operative significance under N 
 well that seems to me 
 itself 
 very strange you would look to the you would look to the state law for purposes of the immigration section but for purposes of N what would you look to either one either one official whichever 
 no N 
 whichever for N whichever one would make it a felony 
 no under 
 you lose 
 under N this court this court in the gonzales case said that it that it has to be a federal crime but not because of the 
 yes 
 definition in 
 right 
 N 
 all right 
 but 
 if its a felony under either one for purposes of N you lose right 
 i dont think i 
 if the act is either a state felony or a federal felony you lose i mean the defendant gets the enhanced sentence right under N 
 no 
 no 
 under N the cases that have been brought have all been situations where it is a official federal offense but because not because of the language in N 
 well 
 but because of the of the language 
 listen 
 in N 
 listen my question is a simple one if its it seems to me if its what you are saying is if it is either a felony under federal law or a felony under state law you get the enhanced sentence under N isnt that right 
 i my understanding of the way N has operated is that if it is a misdemeanor under federal law but maybe it would be a federal felony it would not be it would not give rise to the enhancement because it is not a 
 i thought thats 
 it 
 what the whole argument is about whether it has to be a felony under federal law you are telling me if its a misdemeanor under federal law that you dont get 
 but not 
 the enhanced sentence official 
 but not under not under N 
 but why not 
 the definitional 
 you have thoroughly confused me now 
 but N says that if you have a gun and you have a drugtrafficking crime book N years okay now we go to two whats a drugtrafficking crime it means any felony punishable under the under the controlled substances act now in your definition we first look to see whether simple possession is punishable under the in controlled substances act it sure is it sure is its punishable as a misdemeanor so it meets that under your definition is it a felony yup its a felony in south dakota okay so now we have got a prosecution in federal court in south dakota and on your reading of the statute that guy should get a bumpup of N years 
 no that is not our reading of the statute the 
 because 
 the only thing that is incorporated into N is the definition in official not the definition of 
 yes 
 of drugtrafficking crime in which says 
 yes 
 felony punishable under the controlled 
 right 
 substances act 
 right 
 that is what gets plugged into 
 thats correct 
 N 
 right 
 right 
 along with all of the other provisions in N you look to state law in the case of a state offense the state of conviction the jurisdiction 
 yes 
 of conviction to determine the nature of the crime 
 but you still have to know whether that word felony in means any felony official punishable as a felony under the controlled 
 right and 
 substances act 
 and 
 and there 
 a number 
 yeah you have to know the answer to that 
 a number of courts of appeals that have looked at this in the sentencing context over the years have concluded that it that the absence of that language is very significant and the presence of the language that says any felony is also significant 
 never mind sentencing lets get back to the immigration if i understand what you are now saying if you are convicted in state court of action that is a federal felony but its just a state misdemeanor right you look to the state of conviction and it would be a misdemeanor and the immigration provisions would not would not take effect is 
 yes 
 that right 
 and that and that thats not true official 
 thats extraordinary 
 no but its thats not only true under this provision of N the other the other provisions and and and and that i mentioned that looked to the sentence that may be imposed under state law or that was actually imposed would likewise render someone in that situation who was convicted of only a misdemeanor in state court even though it might be a felony under federal law they would not be they would not be convicted of an aggravated felony because 
 mr kneedler 
 of the way congress chose to write N 
 but is 
 do you 
 that a reasonable lets say the statutes ambiguous and you have convinced us theres no constitutional requirement of uniformity but is it reasonable to assume that congress would want the different consequences to depend on the state of conviction 
 i think it is i mean they are 
 is there anything in the official legislative history suggesting that 
 i think as i say i think its on face of the statute 
 barrett suggests otherwise if what congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of looking for an analogous crime under state law thats that seems to me the at least what congress was trying do 
 well that the legislative history of the amendment in N does not discuss the aspect of barrett that went to the comparison to decide what in what circumstances there would be an analogous federal crime it was clear that it wanted to ratify the result that state crimes are covered but we think that that was evident from the N amendments to that both enacted the definition of aggravated felony revised the definition of drugtrafficking crime to delete the requirement that it be a federal felony that was deleted in N and enhanced sentences 
 you 
 under N clearly on the on by reference to whether someone was convicted of a state felony without any without any general federal minimum official 
 may i 
 what congress 
 may i just switch gears for a moment because your time is almost up and we you havent addressed the mootness problem in toledoflores 
 in toledoflores 
 is the second circuit wrong in us v hamdi because it seems to me that us v hamdi is on all fours with respect to mootness 
 yes we think it is wrong be under this courts decision in spencer versus kemna and other cases that if the possible consequence turns on a discretionary judgment that may be made by someone else that is too speculative to constitute a real live case or controversy and thats what i understand toledoflores to be arguing is that if he applied for discretionary relief in the future that it might it might matter because his sentence might be reduced slightly i should point out that in the district court toledoflores conceded that if he didnt get an eightlevel sentence enhancement he would get a fourlevel sentence enhancement because this is at least a felony within the meaning of the adjacent provision of the guidelines that would result in a guideline range of N to N months he would then have gotten N months under official that guideline range the very same thing that he got here and under the guidelines at the time a term of supervised release was mandatory and a N year term of supervised release was mandatory in those circumstances he would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised release if he had been if he had gotten only the fourlevel enhancement rather than the eightlevel enhancement i also think that it is somewhat farfetched to think that given the fact that toledoflores had more than N illegal entries into the united states and various state offenses that the determination of whether the attorney general would actually grant discretionary relief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence on that particular offense 
 thank you mr kneedler mr long you have N minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice in answer to justice breyers question mr kneedler said that a federal misdemeanor is a drugtrafficking crime under section N if a state punishes it as a felony he said well the federal government never prosecutes federal misdemeanors under section official N he said the reason is because of N and the language there is it has to be an offense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states but that language a person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states for a misdemeanor so the government is making an argument that to my knowledge has never been accepted by any court has not ever been advanced by the government in a criminal context and that would significantly expand section N and numerous other criminal statutes that we cite in our brief that used the same definition of drugtrafficking crime the mr kneedler also said that the aggravated felony provisions in section N refer to state law but i read them just the opposite there are two kinds there are N of them many of them say an offense described in N us code section x i mean thats really what we are dealing with one of those here so it clearly goes to federal law to define the offense now if state law or foreign law also punishes that offense then its an aggravated felony but clearly federal law is defining the offense there are other categories such as murder and theft that are defined in general terms but the governments position as i understand it is again you official use a generic uniform definition you dont pick any definition that the states may have the court just granted 
 well i thought i thought you conceded that a state offense could constitute illicit trafficking 
 well yes 
 in a controlled substance 
 yes mr chief justice but again to be clear and i think this is consistent with the governments position in other cases ultimately there will be some uniform federal definition of what constitutes illicit trafficking it would be some commercial element would probably be the definition the court hasnt decided states can define it more broadly but the actual definition just as the definition of burglary or theft 
 you think theres a uniform federal definition of a theft offense 
 well its i mean as this in the taylor case in burglary the court has a methodology for this you pick a sort of generic definition it may not it may not come from a federal statute it could official 
 theres they will theres no variation in state offenses that would fall within that a theft offense 
 well its again this is the provision we are dealing with is looks to federal law the controlled substances act and two other statutes my understanding of the governments position and its consistent with this courts cases in taylor is that even when its a generic offense you would you would still have a uniform definition and that is certainly consistent with the principle of uniformity that applies both in criminal law and in immigration law i mean if theres any ambiguity at the end of the day ambiguities are supposed to be resolved in favor of uniformity uniform federal law uniform federal criminal law and uniform immigration law effectively what the government is arguing that is that states can banish noncitizens and can do so by enacting drug laws deciding to make a simple possession offense a felony thats a decision that a state would make almost certainly for reasons that have little or nothing to do with immigration and its highly unlikely that congress would have left that determination to states on uniformity aggravated felonies is a condition for citizenship if you are convicted of an official aggravated felony you may not become a us citizen you are foreclosed from establishing good moral character so in fact citizenship is at stake here and the uniformity clause is in play if there are no further questions thank you 
 thank you mr long the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in hammon v indiana mr friedman 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the court can decide these cases as it decided crawford without testing the outer bounds of the confrontation clause by adopting a simple proposition that is easily understood by and intuitively sensible to ordinary lay people and so capable of being passed on from generation to generation as one of the cornerstones of our fundamental liberties a criminal conviction cannot be based on an accusation made privately to a known law enforcement officer if a state wishes that such an accusation be presented in support of a conviction then it must ensure that the accuser testifies in the manner long required by the common law system of criminal justice in the presence of the accused under oath and subject to cross examination as in crawford the court does not need to offer a comprehensive definition of the term testimonial it is enough to say that an accusation to a known law enforcement officer must be testimonial under any plausible definition 
 when for example theres an undercover agent a law enforcement officer lets think of the mafia or the ku klux klan reveals himself one of the coconspirators during the ongoing conspiracy switches sides but no he doesnt switch hes still in the conspiracy makes a whole lot of statements those are all inadmissible though theyd come in now because they would be in the furtherance of the conspiracy 
 statements in furtherance of a conspiracy if i understand 
 yes there but theres in other words i have got your definition and all i have tried to do is create a circumstance where while it fits your definition its made by a person that is in the conspiracy so i make him undercover the law enforcement officer 
 if its an undercover law enforcement 
 but known 
 by by known i mean to the declarant 
 yes 
 by known i mean to the declarant so if its 
 yes 
 if its an undercover agent and so its a statement to an undercover 
 so you are saying my hypothetical could never come up what im trying to do is it seems to me that your hypothetical is going to take statements that would come in that are pretty far removed from the prosecution that are in odd circumstances are not just a testimonial at all in anybodys thought but it keeps them out 
 i im afraid i i dont fully understand the hypothetical if the if the officer is not known to the declarant as a law enforcement officer then theres no problem then then the statement could 
 hes known 
 if hes hes known to the law enforcement officer and the member of the conspiracy is making a 
 its continuing 
 its a continuing conspiracy but but that statement to the law enforcement officer saying that somebody else in the conspiracy has committed a crime would not in fact be in furtherance of the conspiracy it would blow the conspiracy apart 
 all right you have convinced me i have a bad hypothetical 
 you go ahead 
 i i dont think its your honor i feel dutybound to say there are no bad hypotheticals but there are there are easy ones and i think if if its a known officer its in that situation its going to be accusatorial if its not a known officer its its not accusatorial 
 what if a statement is made to a known law enforcement officer providing information thats thats very incriminating against somebody but it doesnt specifically identify that person does that fall within your test 
 i i believe it does of course in this case we have both a description of the crime and an identification of the perpetrator 
 so its an accusation even though it doesnt identify the person who is alleged to be the perpetrator 
 we could call it what we will i think i think that it still would be within the narrow proposition that we are advocating that a that a description of the crime to a known 
 so really your test is any evidence thats any statement made to the police or is an is testimony 
 no your honor i think it it either has to describe a crime or identify the perpetrator or as in this case do both so 
 any relevant evidence given to law enforcement is testimonial 
 well when you say when you say relevant i think that if the law enforcement officer if if its a statement to a known law enforcement officer in the line of duty its its almost always going to be testimonial if it if it identifies the the perpetrator or describes the crime i would say its clearly testimonial or if its in response to the to the officers inquiries its clearly 
 if somebody calls and says i just saw a blue toyota with ohio plates commit a hit and run thats testimonial 
 i believe i believe so now now in fact that would provide some identifying information because it is a person who is associated with that blue with that blue toyota but if its simply a officer in the donut shop i just saw jack hes back in town with no clear relation to any any crime thats presumably just chatter and that wouldnt be testimonial even if it even if it later becomes relevant 
 but if its relevant that jack is back in town then thats testimonial 
 if if at the moment that its made the declarant understands that jack being back in town might be useful in an investigation or if a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would understand it that would be testimonial yes yes your honor so the the basic principle for which we are advocating does not lie at the outside of the of the definition of testimonial i think its simply a core proposition 
 and the people who are making all these statements are are to be understood as witnesses against somebody within the the language of the confrontation clause 
 i think within the within the meaning of the confrontation clause if those statements are allowed at proof as proof at trial without the person coming in then what we have essentially done is created a system by which people can create evidence for use by the legal system by engaging those statements without coming into court thats thats right and so i think one of the critical factors here is to imagine what happens if statements such as the ones in in this case are admitted are admissible and this court holds holds that they are then basically they always can be admitted then any state is free to create a system in which a statement to a responding officer comes in as proof theres no need for the for the the declarant to show up at trial and theres no doubt that that that is what would happen california and oregon have already adopted such statutes and and my state of michigan is on the verge of doing so 
 statutes that that say what 
 that say that say accusations to a made to a law enforcement officer in the case of oregon and the pending michigan bill accusations of domestic violence are admissible so long as they are made reasonably freshly but they give a N hour time frame they they are admissible no need for excitement so so the idea that that the jurisdictions have limited this to to excited utterances is is not is not so if if the court affirms the decision here i think the message would go out that these that these statutes are perfectly okay 
 and those those 
 and and what what is the theory on which the statutes are are adopted 
 the 
 whats the argument that they propose to say its not testimonial i know you disagree with it but 
 justice kennedy the i dont think there is a theory and i say that quite seriously i i actually testified last month before the michigan house on the the bill saying i believe this bill is blatantly unconstitutional i believe its going to be held unconstitutional within a few months there was not a high level of interest in the constitutional argument before the legislature i dont think there is a theory i think the i think the theory is that prosecutors say that these would be good laws to pass so 
 whats whats worrying me on this is i will tell you my concern without the hypothetical crawford wrenches the confrontation clause free of the hearsay rule and therefore testimony it might be testimonial even though it is not hearsay or falls within an doesnt fall within an exception you understand what im saying fine now you come along with a suggestion and what struck me immediately was that wait a minute cant i easily think apparently not easily cant i easily think of instances where it would be testimonial but it isnt an accusation made to a policeman and conversely cant i easily think not easily of instances where well it would have come in but it was statements made to a policeman maybe years before maybe about this maybe about that maybe its a hospital record maybe its a business record there are all kinds of exceptions to the hearsay rule and they dont run parallel to the test you have just given thats whats worrying me whats the test 
 your honor let let me be very clear we do not propose that this categorical principle that an accusation to a law enforcement officer is a definition of whats testimonial we regard this as a core category of testimonial statements such as the core categories that the court listed in crawford so so if a statement fits within that within that category that is sufficient to make it testimonial 
 such as in crawford but in crawford it was the kind of formal statement the court said materials such as affidavits custodial examinations prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross examine or similar pretrial statements similar pretrial statement is not an agitated woman calling N or telling a police officer who as in your case who comes in response to a call theres a disturbance going on in that house get there 
 right i i understand justice ginsburg of course crawford was only listing a nonexclusive list of of core of core categories 
 yes we we that that quotation was a a description of what crawford described as the core 
 right 
 not not the totality of 
 certainly not the totality and if you say well this statement was informal it it doesnt make sense and i think it conflicts with a comment in crawford in footnote N to say well informal testimony is is okay as the court said in in crawford if if sworn outofcourt testimony is invalid it wouldnt make sense to say that unsworn testimonial statements are perfectly okay now so far as the principle that that because the witness is under agitation the the confrontation clause doesnt doesnt apply i dont think thats thats valid at at all it certainly isnt valid historically if if it were we would have seen examples over history in which agitated declarants their statements came in but as as general dreeben has indicated the very the very organizing principle of prosecution was that the accuser must come and come and testify 
 did the legislatures that have passed laws of the kind you describe have before them information that there is a rather high incidence of the victim being intimidated and therefore not showing up in court to testify 
 your your honor in the in the old bailey sessions papers there were approximately N percent of the cases the victim who was the prosecutor did not show up it was a recurring a recurring matter why they didnt show up may have been for various reasons and i want to emphasize that the state in the very first paragraph of its brief emphasizes that there are numerous reasons why in the domestic violence context the the accuser may not testify in court and in those roughly N percent of all the cases which is N cases in not a single one well im sorry there was one in which there was a a conviction thats because because the defendant because the defendant confessed but in all the others the accusation was the the case was summarily dismissed 
 well you you have to assume not only that the victim is unwilling or reluctant to testify you have to assume that the victim has disappeared because the victim unwilling or not could be subpoenaed isnt that right 
 the the victim could be subpoenaed and in in this case as in davis the victim was subpoenaed but subpoenas have to be enforced and and i think in some cases the prosecution does simply doesnt enforce the subpoenas its what the cook county 
 right but im saying the scope of the problem is is much more narrow than what is suggested by simply describing how often it is that the that the complaining witness is reluctant to testify that doesnt stop anything 
 well 
 reluctant or not that witness can be can be subpoenaed 
 that is that is correct justice scalia it is the states choice whether to compel the the person to to testify and if as cook county has done they put in particular efforts to protect the witness to encourage her to testify then prosecutors get a very high return that is in in the cook county program N percent of of the witnesses testify they get a very high conviction rate and they protect the the witnesses so i think the message from this court is going to be one of two things either its okay to adopt a california or oregon type of statute and just just let any statements come come in or we have to put in the resources to to into domestic violence to ensure that the witnesses come come to court 
 i dont know why the or would necessarily follow i mean if you prevail theres nothing that compels the state to put money in what has been suggested a training program shelters counselors for these people 
 they 
 nothing at all compels the state to do that 
 they they would not be compelled to do that but they would not be compelled constitutionally to do that they would simply be deprived of a of of the socalled evidencebased prosecution which has just been a phenomenon of the last N years 
 your point i thought was that that would be the incentive for 
 that that 
 for police departments of course 
 that that that is correct 
 if they want to make their cases 
 that is correct they they would they want to make their cases and and i think they can make their cases best if the witness testifies in which case under the confrontation clause now now construed theres no objection then to bringing in the prior statement at all 
 what about present sense perceptions that might be a good one 
 and and 
 apparently N has the first exception 
 right 
 to the hearsay rule its present sense impression 
 yes 
 so on the phone somebody is describing very calmly very calmly to the policeman the terrible crime that he sees going on in front of him now i gather from the fact that its an that it is a exception that now in the federal courts that would be admissible 
 well it would have been under roberts presumably 
 yes no forget the yes every day of the week they come in is that right present sense impressions its here as the first exception to the hearsay rule 
 its its an exception in civil cases theres no problem in in criminal cases 
 well there it is N 
 thats right 
 i mean and you practiced this for years see i mean you are an expert in this and i i think my impression just tell me if im wrong is its N it says a present sense impression comes in so i guess it does unless im 
 yes but until until white v illinois basically let the guard down these these statements could not come accusatory statements that might have been in present sense impressions did not were were not the basis for prosecutions once once white v illinois was decided then then courts allowed them in routinely 
 so if we adopt your rule a person calls up on the phone and says im here at the baseball game theres a terrible crime going on in front of me and he describes it 
 right 
 to the police officer that no longer could come in 
 i i believe that is correct because that 
 i should hope not i mean 
 it it shouldnt its an accusatory its an accusatory statement to to a a to law enforcement now i mean the court could if it wanted carve out or or draw the line at statements that are describing the contemporaneous the absolutely contemporaneous commission of a crime i dont think its a particularly good line to draw 
 no no i wasnt 
 yes 
 trying to reduct you out of 
 right 
 i just wanted to know what the facts are about the rule i was just thats what i was asking 
 the the rule is that the hearsay law the rule against hearsay provides the modern rule against hearsay provides no no restriction the confrontation clause should and let me address the your concern justice breyer that is this hearsay rather than than confrontation i think i think that the notion of the accuser is central to the confrontation right and always and always has been and those N cases really develop as of N the rule against hearsay was barely developed and we cite or the the rule against hearsay was barely developed and edmund burke said that a trained parrot could recite all the laws of evidence in N minutes and that is no longer that is no longer so 
 edmund burke say that 
 edmund burke said that yes 
 mr friedman can i go back to your answer that the police will then in response to the position that you are urging will then protect the victim and all these fine things it wasnt so long ago that the police wouldnt bother with these prosecutions at all they didnt care about them and if you say you are going to have to drag in the victim you are going to have to jail her for contempt if shes so scared that she wont testify they will say who needs it we have got a lot of other crimes to prosecute 
 well i i hope not your honor and i i believe that we have gotten past the point i mean i think we now recognize how serious a a crime domestic violence is let me emphasize that it is just as now sometimes a prosecutor will compel a victim to testify it will still be that sometimes they will and sometimes they wont that will be a matter of of state policy there are other approaches as as well and and hopefully compulsion isnt necessary i think if the prosecutors pay pay sufficient attention and and care but beyond that theres the possibility of forfeiture if indeed the reason why the victim will not testify is because of intimidation then then the prosecution it is open to the prosecution to prove that in many cases the case can be proven 
 thats very powerfully hard to prove isnt it 
 i dont think so your honor and and of course it remains to be seen just how easy or how hard it it is to to prove but in fact the as mr fisher said the rules of evidence dont apply at the at the preliminary hearing its the judge not the the jury that has to decide and the standard of proof presumably would not be beyond a reasonable doubt so 
 but you are back as justice breyer pointed earlier you are making the prosecution prove two crimes instead of one 
 well intimidation is is a crime but it wouldnt it wouldnt be a full criminal case it would as in many other contexts simply a preliminary hearing on on a threshold issue as we have for every evidentiary problem for every for any any evidentiary problem such as does the present sense impression exception apply theres a preliminary 
 well but every evidentiary problem the the root of the problem is not the inability of the or the unwillingness of the primary victim to testify i mean thats what makes intimidation so hard to prove in these cases is because you have to get the if if the intimidation is successful the witness to testify about the the crime is unavailable and unwilling to do so 
 well it it would remain for the court to determine what the standards are for proving 
 well you wouldnt have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt would you 
 i i wouldnt 
 this is this is a pretrial hearing on whether the the theres been intimidation couldnt the judge just find it more likely than not that the defendant has intimidated a witness 
 prior decisions of the court suggest that that would most likely be the the standard it may be 
 but the the judge cant make that finding if the witness doesnt testify can he 
 oh i think that that the judge may well and i think it would remain 
 hows that the prosecutor goes in and says we think the defendant has intimidated the witness by saying hes not going to support her financially hes going to leave whatever and and the presumably the the defendant says no no and the witness isnt there the judge says well i find by a preponderance of the evidence that he has intimidated her 
 i think it remains an open question what the standards would be for for proof and whether that would be constitutionally accepted this of course is a matter for for another day i think what the court cant do is effectively assume as a or create an irrebuttable presumption that in all domestic violence cases the the victim has been intimidated which is what the state asks even though they acknowledge at the very outset that there are many other reasons why why the victim may not testify the theres no domestic violence exception for the confrontation right just as theres no organized crime exception for the confrontation right so i do think that that what the procedures are for forfeiture is is a big open question but but its the states burden to prove forfeiture it it cant be assumed as a per se matter 
 do you have a second choice rule i mean we have professor amar who has pretty formal criteria 
 yes 
 we have the rule that you just enunciated and i dont want before you sit down to i want to find out if you have an intermediate position a fallback position 
 well our our narrow rule is is simply the an accusation to a law enforcement officer we we of course believe that the more general test is reasonable expectation of the declarant and thats where where i disagree with with professor amar i dont know that he would i dont know that he would disagree id be surprised if he would disagree that an accusation to a law enforcement officer is is testimonial because because that is such a a narrow principle now now he does speak about about formality but formality for reasons i suggested i dont think i dont think makes an awful lot of sense because it then gives the police officers and prosecutors an incentive to take testimony informally and what we have then as in this case we have not the affidavit which which the state is condemning as admissible they now concede that thats inadmissible the evidence on which this prosecution is based is a police officers rendition of what he was told orally which is a denigrated form of form of evidence thats where a formality rule will will get you 
 where where do you come out on the person running out of the house and yelling to her neighbor with the law enforcement officer standing by 
 and and 
 its not the statement is not to the law enforcement officer but he or she overhears it 
 if if the if the speaker knows that the law enforcement officer is there 
 doesnt 
 then then i then then its not within the narrow categorical rule for which we are we are asking now it may come within the general test of reasonable expectation 
 is anybody is anybody working for the state a law enforcement officer 
 no not not within the within the narrow categorical rule that we are asking i think its another question if say you are speaking to a a doctor whos an employee of the state hospital 
 or a N operator who was an agent of of the police 
 a N operator is a direct conduit to the police and the police are a direct conduit to the court and and that addresses your hypothetical justice scalia about the the affidavit right to the court the person writes an affidavit right to the court under under the theory presented by the state under the resemblance theory lets take away the the sworn part of the affidavit its just a letter or or a message over the internet or a videotape all of those would be allowed because theres no formality because theres no interrogation and thats a grotesque result 
 im not sure what what sense it makes two cases the woman runs out and and says he he stabbed me and im dying hes a murderer case one its a a neighbor case two its a police officer and she sees that hes a police officer why why should there be a difference it doesnt make any sense to me 
 well im im not saying there necessarily should be a difference i think i think in the 
 well i thought your test was if she knows that hes a police officer its testimonial 
 we are saying that is an easy case thats what professor mosteller called a dead bang case where its made to a police officer 
 well let me put it this way i dont know why one case is so easier than the other 
 i think its an easier case because the police officer is a direct conduit to the to the machinery of of justice when you are speaking to a police officer you know you are speaking to the state if the court has no further questions i will reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you counsel mr fisher 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court amy hammons oral statements to officer mooney arose in an emergency situation very similar to a N call not in a situation where a detective was attempting to subvert the judicial system by developing evidence in secret with no intention of ever letting the witness testify at trial 
 shes sitting down at at a table as i recall it with the with the police officer on the other side of the table 
 she may yes i think 
 has a cup of coffee 
 well i dont know about that she was in the living room 
 i thought there was a cup of coffee too maybe i dont know where i got that from maybe i made it up 
 well what we know is that the 
 it didnt seem to me a terribly emergency situation in in that kind of a context 
 i respectfully disagree your honor we are talking about a woman who has has stated that she has suffered a beating from her husband that a beating that may flare up at any time if the officers withdraw and the officer needs to know what happened so that he can properly address the situation 
 at the time the officer is right there in the house theres certainly no emergency at the time now you could say that that the woman is frightened about a recurrence but if if thats your definition of an emergency its going to cover an awful lot of situations 
 well i think its the the moment to consider is not just the moment when the officers are present but in fact what would happen if the officers were to do nothing which is one of the choices that i suppose the officers had they could find out what was going on and address the situation or they could withdraw doing nothing and then leave amy hammon to her own devices in a highly explosive situation they we dont know exactly what what officer mooney said when he went back into the living room but what we know is that there was no apparent interrogation of any type we know that amy hammon at that point told him the story of the argument that had taken place and the resulting physical abuse now what we know from from the accusation test that is put forth by by the petitioner is that the reason that it doesnt apply apparently to all statements to to police officers is that it must somehow take account of the coconspirator statement but we dont otherwise have any grounding of that test in the history of the confrontation clause the test that we are proposing the broader test that we are proposing the resemblance test flows directly from statements in crawford suggesting that the way that we know what is testimonial and what is not is by examining the lessons of history what we are proposing is that in any particular context if the statement resembles one of those historical abuses in the civil law tradition then in that circumstance its testimonial but if the 
 isnt isnt the problem though i mean as crawford said those examples defined the core they were the paradigms but they didnt purport to cover the whole ground and it seems to me that your argument is to turn the core into the exclusive examples in which case the confrontation clause in the real world is never going to apply 
 your honor i think the important lesson from crawford in that regard is is the methodology and the methodology was lets look at history what does history tell us the founders were concerned about and the court listed the specific examples of affidavits depositions pretrial hearings and and expanded that even to include interrogation and in excuse me particular cases coming coming up if there is evidence that that the statements do correspond to historical abuses even if those abuses were not listed in crawford then that would be a different situation that would be testimonial 
 well im not sure that that was the only concern of the founders i mean the the you know the the fact that that the state could corrupt the the statement through the interrogation im not sure that was the only concern i i think the founders believed in a judicial system at least in criminal cases where the person has a right to cross examine his accuser whether the fact that the i am i will put it this way i am quite sure that it would have been held a violation of the confrontation clause if as the prior example i gave someone wrote out an affidavit and sent it directly to the court no intervening police interrogation at all just wrote out an affidavit from from france mailed it to the court and the court has this affidavit i am sure that would be a smackbang violation of the confrontation clause and theres none of the the abuse that on on which you you would hinge the entirety of the violation 
 well except that we do know that that affidavits i agree would have been prohibited and thats one of the classic forms of testimony indeed that was enumerated in crawford and that was kept out at the founding and that falls into a very welldefined category 
 but one of the reasons for that is lets assume you had a completely honest police officer you may have a motive on the part of the witness to frame the defendant i mean thats another reason 
 well i think it ostensibly could be i think what we know though looking back at what at the at the raleigh trial and at at the at the trials even in the colonial period was that the founders were concerned about abuses by the state in in particular in interrogations and in eliciting these affidavits and in using pretrial testimony 
 but im suggesting to you that it often happens that there are false charges made that the that the police believe to be true 
 the false charges scenario is 
 and this is fully consistent with prohibiting testimonial statements 
 again i think what crawford was talking about in terms of trying to understand the confrontation clause was not simply to hypothesize various problems that different types of evidence could present if it werent cross examined but instead to examine more particularly what the founders were concerned about and that was not one of the of the categories simply 
 may i ask this mr fisher what is your answer to justice scalias hypothetical an entirely volunteered affidavit by the accuser is that admissible or not 
 i think that well certainly its testimonial and so 
 so that would be prohibited by the confrontation clause yet that was clearly not an example that would fall within the marian practice 
 well whether it would have come in 
 i mean it doesnt resemble it is what im saying 
 whether it would have been a problem under the marian practice i think is only part of the story and certainly crawford recognized that affidavits as a category were part of the of the tradition that led to the abuses that the founders were concerned about so marian is again part of the story but not necessarily the whole thing now when we articulate this resemblance 
 before you leave that surely the affidavit isnt isnt whats magical i mean im going to change my hypothetical the person recites his accusation on a tape recorder and mails the tape to the court now are you going to say well its not an affidavit youd exclude that as well wouldnt you 
 well i i dont know that i would because again you have got the you have got the form that crawford was concerned about the affidavit is the classic form 
 that would make no sense at all i mean that that is just the worst sort of formalism if you do it in an affidavit its its bad but if you put it on a tape its its good i i cannot understand any reason for that 
 well i dont know that the analysis has to end there i think for example there were other circumstances where other types of communications were problematic in in raleighs trial for example cobham had submitted a letter and that was recited as part of the the concern now if the court were to determine that a recording of that sort was similar enough it resembled enough that sort of abuse then yes it could be testimonial 
 mr fisher let me again be sure i understand your position would the unsworn letter that justice scalia describes be admissible or inadmissible under your view 
 i think that there is evidence historically that a letter would be testimonial certainly coming out of cobhams case and and other circumstances 
 so then you dont rely on the affidavit point 
 well i think its its a matter of what what is covered what is mentioned in history affidavit is one of those those categories letters in particular in raleighs trial was another area that may have been problematic and i think 
 if thats your criterion are you going to draw the distinction between the letter and the tape recording 
 well i think that that is the whether we have the resemblance test doesnt require us to answer that question because i think that the examination the court would undertake would again 
 well lets answer it is is the tape recording like the letter so that it its inadmissible 
 i think its i think it is very similar to the letter and and could well be inadmissible but i dont know that its if the court adheres to the test that it set forth in crawford that its looking for forms of testimony that were prohibited at common law certainly that would not have been one of them 
 a videotape a videotape of a crime scene is admissible right 
 i think thats thats right now if its if you have a videotape of someone that thats responding to an interrogation thats an entirely different thing 
 no 
 but a videotape of a crime scene again would be would be not testimonial 
 but a tape recording by the same person who videotaped the crime scene describing what he saw you agree would be excluded 
 i think that theres a high chance that could be be excluded 
 so whats the test 
 its the resemblance test and the question 
 resemblance to 
 to the historical abuses that the founders were trying to address and the 
 which were 
 well which were in particular we know affidavits we also know something about letters and the question with the tape recording is is it enough like does it resemble those enough 
 do you accept the governments 
 i think the problem with the examples is that none of these are abuses as i see it the examples of the tape recording mailed in and the volunteer statement i dont see how you can call those abuses 
 well i think the abuse comes not simply in how they were created but but then in how they were later used and and again we are talking about trying to to craft a rule in part that has some bright lines to it based on on just what was what forms were not used 
 why isnt the the bright line that the government asserts that this is a crime made in an urgent situation when one doesnt the declarant doesnt think rationally will this be used eventually in a trial where the declarant wants to stop an imminent threat 
 i certainly think that that follows from the the overall test we propose 
 but thats a different test than the resemblance test that you are proposing 
 our position is its a corollary to it and certainly its a narrower test and applies i think here in in both cases to that and it provides the opportunity resolve both cases on the notion that when the officers were at the scene they were in no way behaving like inquisitors they showed up they were they could they were in the middle of of an abusive situation that could explode at any time and they needed to know what what was going on in order to diffuse the situation so this case could be resolved on that on a much narrower ground its its important here also to to recognize that what the what the prosecution did has no no similarity to what would happen at the common law we have here the government issuing a subpoena to amy hammon to come and testify and obviously showing that they would have preferred the live testimony in this case 
 was there was there any showing at all of whether they made the police or the prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena 
 there was no such effort your honor but well here if i may be permitted to go beyond the record just a little bit what we what we do know is that the case was continued one time because amy hammon did not show up in response to a subpoena and that the second time the the trial proceeded but there was no effort to send someone out to to enforce it or to bring any sort of contempt sanction 
 well lets assume your you have here a woman whos sitting down in the kitchen with the police officer talks to the police officer and then signs an affidavit did she sign the affidavit at that time 
 thats right yes 
 and that affidavit was not admissible because its an affidavit 
 correct 
 but the police officer who testified to what she said and what he wrote down in the affidavit that she signed that does get in 
 correct 
 i i cant see why that makes any sense at all i mean she she was either testifying when she spoke and then signed the affidavit as evidence of her testimony or or else she wasnt testifying in which case both the affidavit and the oral statement should be in i cant i cant see drawing the line between those two it really seems very strange to me 
 well i think whether you look at it from her perspective or from the officers perspective that something did change in the moment between the oral statement and the affidavit if you look at it from from the officers perspective once amy hammon disclosed to him what had happened and and gave him information that he needed to handle the situation then he could go about handling the situation he didnt need the affidavit to do that once he turned to get the affidavit he he was transitioning to less from an emergency mode and more to an evidencegathering mode if you are if you are looking at it from the standpoint of amy hammon then at that point when when officer mooney is is in the house and has her husband you know in another room and shes trying to just describe whats going on so that she can be protected thats a far different mind set 
 well but its a its a classic mixed motive case we dont know when the officer is sitting down with her and asking the questions whether his primary motive is to make sure the guy doesnt come back or if his primary motive is to help make the case against the guy its both 
 well i think its reasonable to assume that officers faced with an emergency situation are primarily going to be working for from a concern of safety for their own and for others and so even if it is a mixed motive i think that the point is that particular circumstance its reasonable to infer where theres an emergency ongoing emergency an ongoing immediate safety concern that safety and security are going to be the primary motive 
 why does his motive matter i mean the the issue is whether she is testifying whether she is a witness and i dont see how that changes when she tells him these things orally and when she signs the affidavit afterwards it seems to me shes testifying as to what events had occurred 
 well let me be clear that we are not suggesting a subjective inquiry into the officers motive but what we are saying is that whether a statement is testimonial depends on whether the government is is purely collecting evidence making someone undergo an interrogation for example or whether they are performing tasks that really were not part of of any type of police function at the founding which is sort of a community caretaking public safety function so that by definition in eliciting statements concerning the immediate safety issue the police officer could not have been engaged in the kinds of abuses that gave rise 
 all right this is helpful very helpful to me but im trying to see what you are driving at im imagining the woman saying hes hitting me hes just hit me shes in tears thats excited utterance not then suddenly the officer N minutes later says i have heard what you said lets reduce it to writing heres the formal affidavit et cetera that is but to prevent mr friedmans problem we are going to have to say as to the second that is even if you dont have the formality you see everything is the same but not the formality now how do we do that 
 im not sure if im following not formality 
 im making the distinction you are making between shes in tears excited utterance or res gestae around there just what you were talking about now think of the second affidavit when he reduces it to writing thats different calmer clearly motive to testify et cetera fine but now what mr friedman pointed out is if we make it turn solely on the formality the piece of paper the stamp et cetera they will just avoid that so we are going to have to sweep into the second the circumstance where everything is the same but the formality and thats where i have the difficulty 
 well again the the difficult task of understanding the confrontation clause is to figure out what limits there might be and and in crawford the methodology was what does history tell us the framers were concerned about and certainly the formal affidavit was something that they were very concerned about the less formal forms they were not and certainly when it comes to something as as recent you know relatively speaking as as the community caretaking function of the police that was in no way part of of the abuses that the framers were concerned about and so i think even if the court were to limit its decision to that part of the test resolving the other instances according to the resemblance test or or trying to figure out where to draw that you know that line could come later consistent with its decision in this case 
 but your answer i take it assumes that the framers had no concern with the capacity of the court to test the the validity or the truth of the statement 
 well im not entirely sure if thats the case i mean i of course they were operating in a in a circumstance where where hearsay rules were were part of trial process certainly also to the extent that that a particular procedure is is outrageous the a due process concern might arise but 
 well but no but im im not talking about outrageous circumstances in which the the statement was taken im talking about the capacity of the court by whatever means to test the truth of that statement once it is placed before the court and i understood your argument to justice breyer to assume that that testing function was not within the contemplation of the framers 
 i think it was with respect to to the abuses that testimony elicited through the abuses that gave rise to the clause the the common or im sorry the civil law type abuses they did want to test that but the concern 
 so that your your you would then say they want a they want to test certain in certain cases where they think there may have been an abuse in the elicitation of the statement but if there is there is no reason to suspect that the statement was taken under untoward circumstances they were not concerned to test its validity 
 i think that that thats largely accurate but they were dealing with i think a rather set form 
 but is that your position 
 well yes but but if i may add a clarification which is to say the reason i think that we could circumscribe affidavits regardless of whether the elicitation abuses are present is simply for ease of administration that abuses known to the framers would have been arising in a circumstance where there would have been those abuses and and as a form 
 dont dont you think the framers were aware of the fact that although there were law enforcement abuses raleighs case and so on there were also abuses every day of the week on the part of people who gave false testimony because they had grudges against the defendant do you think that was totally out of the minds of the framers so as to support the distinction that that as a general rule you were suggesting 
 we dont know exactly all of the details that would have that they were contemplating 
 but why would why would we impute that that unconcern to the framers about the the need to test statements which may very well have have been given because of envy grudge and so on 
 because of of what we do know and what crawford said that we do know which is that we know that they were responding to things like raleighs trial and to stamp act you know enforcement other 
 well but doesnt doesnt that get us back to the fact that those examples were given in crawford as paradigm examples if you know those were i think the word poor was used but but crawford was not limited to that and if its not limited to that why in effect does the does the should we conclude that the concern of the clause stops short of the selfinterested witness even though he didnt make an affidavit 
 again if i may be permitted to finish the methodology the methodology of crawford is to look for known circumstances of abuse about which the framers were concerned and we dont have that sort of historical evidence more generally 
 thank you counsel mr gornstein 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court we are asking the court to apply the same standard to statements made to officers at the scene as to statements made during a N call if the statement is made in response to police questions that are reasonably necessary to determine whether an emergency exists 
 may i ask under your view was the affidavit admissible 
 the affidavit is not admissible 
 why not 
 the affidavit is is not admissible because by that point the officer had the information that he needed to resolve the emergency and what he was soliciting at that point 
 i would suggest the reason it was not admissible is its very clear that the affidavit is the testimonial statement by a witness that the defendant had a right to confront the constitutional right is the right to confront the witnesses against him 
 i was just getting to that justice stevens 
 oh 
 that the the emergency was resolved and at that point he was 
 but you say if the officer independently repeats what is said in the affidavit then hes the witness against rather than the 
 no not no hes hes not if he was repeating what was said in the affidavit thats a different point hes repeating the statement that was made before the affidavit was given that was at a point at which the there was still an immediate danger and that he was asking a question that was reasonably necessary to determine whether that danger existed and if so how to resolve it 
 what was the immediate danger 
 when the immediate danger was 
 i mean theres the policeman in the room across the kitchen table from from the woman 
 the 
 hes not on the end of a phone line hes in the room across the kitchen table 
 thats correct and and the problem here is what the danger was what would happen if the officers left when when the officer came in and saw a frightened ms hammon he saw wreckage on the floor he had reason to be concerned that there was a very recent attack on her and that if he left the scene that attack would be renewed asking ms hammon what happened was reasonably necessary to determine whether that emergency existed and if so how to resolve it now once he had that information he had what he needed to resolve the emergency and at that 
 in a situation like that what was needed to resolve the situation if he believed what mrs hammon said was to arrest mr hammon right 
 thats correct 
 so he could you think he could gather as much evidence as was necessary to arrest mr hammon 
 i do not at some 
 why why not why doesnt that follow 
 well at some point what what turns into emergency resolution moves over into interrogation and once you reach interrogation then you have reached the core of what crawford talks about 
 how do we know when that line is crossed you said reasonably necessary to protect safety thats okay interrogation is not good but how how does one tell when one stops and the other starts 
 i i think this is going to be a linedrawing question but when you have a situation like this one where you have an officer whos just on the scene in the immediate wake of a of a domestic dispute he asks a single question what happened in in circumstances in which he needed to know the answer to that question to make sure he could leave and leave her there safely thats not interrogation if he sat around for a half hour with a backandforth and giveandtake and trying to press and get to the situation in that kind of backandforth that would be interrogation colloquially and its its that kind of line that the court is going to need to draw 
 why because he might be interrogating with no idea at all primarily in his mind of later court appearance he wants to find out if there are guns in the house he wants to find out if there are other people in the house he wants to find out if somebody is being held captive he wants to find out if these are the same people who did some other crime thats immediately taking place whats the relationship there are all kinds of interrogation you are saying that all that interrogation by a policeman cant come in under the confrontation clause 
 the confrontation clause bars under crawford police interrogation and the the situation is one in which we are not going to be able to examine the individual motives of officers in every case and individual declarants in every case what we are looking for is a categorical rule that is going to capture the likely motivations in both cases and when you have emergency question you are likely dealing with the situation with both from the officers side and from the declarants side you are going to be having people attempting to resolve an immediate danger of harm and you get 
 that that assumes this your your focus on whether the you know the its an interrogation or not it it assumes that the only focus of the confrontation clause is on prosecutorial abuse somehow and and as as justice souter was suggesting i dont think that was the exclusive 
 no we dont we dont think thats the exclusive focus either and we think interrogation can capture both too that when you get to the point of interrogation whats happening with the witness is getting an increasing understanding that what this is being sought for is to build a case i think the biggest problem with the the two rules that are proposed on the other side that is the accusation rule and the reasonable anticipation rule is it captures within a these emergency statements that really dont have fall within any ordinary understanding of what testimony is if i go to my house and its late at night i hear suspicious noises and i see somebody and get a partial description of him and i call N im seeking to avert an immediate danger to myself i dont think under any stretch of the imagination anybody would refer to that as testimony yet under his rule 
 of course the sixth amendment doesnt use the word testimony does it 
 no it does not but what the court said in crawford was that the term witness was referring to that people can make testimonial statements 
 and maybe that and maybe you are not a witness when you make the call but when that same call is admitted into court then then it strikes me that you are a witness 
 but but thats not the definition of witness that that crawford adopted that would be 
 as it happens in the other in the companion case today the prosecution itself in its summation to the jury referred to the N call and said you have heard the testimony of of the victim and referred to it as testimony 
 justice scalia if he 
 i mean its not beyond the pale to consider this testimony 
 if if he he had made a statement about a coconspirators statement during the course of the conspiracy and he had said we have here the testimony of the his coconspirator that would not make it testimony and if the the N call 
 no but it would prove that that its not beyond the pale to call it testimony 
 well it just does not make it testimony and if it the prosecutor in the N case had said i dont have her testimony i have something better its a N call 
 mr gornstein 
 of a cry for help that wouldnt make it not testimony and i dont think 
 mr gornstein is this a fair summary of your position if i may we are really asking whos the witness thats being testified against and when its the affidavit its clearly the woman thats a witness there where its inadmissible but your view as i understand you is when its the officer who is the witness hes subject to cross examination and as long as the emergency continues and hes describing what happened during the emergency hes still the witness thats what you are saying i think 
 hes hes still a 
 hes still the witness we are concerned about 
 he is the witness 
 therefore hes subject to cross examination 
 hes the hes the he is subject to cross examination 
 and so during the emergency period he can repeat what she said 
 but i what im saying is that shes not a witness during the emergency period itself 
 i understand what you are saying 
 it has to be both 
 that we focus not on whether its testimony but whether hes the witness at the critical time or whether shes the witness 
 i i think that thats one way of looking at it justice stevens but 
 thats not the way the court looked at it in crawford 
 no i i think that what you would look to see is if at the relevant time that that the declarant was acting as a witness and at the relevant time when somebody is answering a question to avert an immediate danger they are not acting as a witness they are not making a solemn declaration for the purpose of proving facts to support a prosecution and so they are not acting as a witness in those circumstances and and its only later when the officer turns to soliciting from ms hammon an affidavit that what hes soliciting at that point is a solemn declaration made for the purpose of proving facts to support a prosecution now thats testimony 
 im not sure that the two were were as separated as you as you claim i i took it that the affidavit while he was getting the oral responses he was writing down what what would be put in the affidavit 
 i dont think that theres any evidence in the record to support that justice scalia that that what happened is that he took that he listened to her oral statement and then he proceeded to ask for her for an affidavit after he had the information that he needed to resolve the emergency was to figure out how he was going to protect this person from an immediate renewed attack if he left the scene 
 but under your test the whole question is whether the emergency continued at the time the witness words are being repeated 
 its not the whole question because if the statement the question has nothing to do with and the answer had nothing to do with the emergency it does not come in under the rule we are talking about 
 no im not arguing that im trying to figure out i think i have a little different angle on it than you actually said in your brief or actually in the text of crawford of course crawford wasnt confronting this problem it described everything as testimonial but the real question is whos the witness under the text of the constitution 
 well justice stevens im 
 and i think your argument is 
 im happy to have your approach if it if it leads to five votes in this case 
 i think im trying to help you 
 i know it didnt start out that way but it seems to me im helping your side of it yes 
 thank you mr gornstein mr friedman you have N minutes remaining 
 i i think that whenever there is a an outofcourt accusation repeated there is a witness in court but that is not the witness that or that doesnt satisfy the confrontation right because theres the the 
 no but you would agree that the officer could testify to some of the things that happened during the emergency and hes a witness to that extent 
 yes absolutely the officer was 
 and the question is whether he can cover this as well 
 thats that of course is the that thats the question but but she was acting as a a witness when when she made the accusation to to the officer and characterizing it as an emergency i dont think helps anything in in this case the the fact is that if we extend the emergency this far it shows well it shows just how capable of expansion the the theory is because there is an officer with her and there is an officer with with him so the the only question is should the officers leave that means that whenever theres theres a victim potentially at large there the confrontation right wouldnt wouldnt apply the the whole emergency doctrine really distorts incentives because a a police officer who has a a dual motive of creating of protecting people protecting the safety of of people and gathering evidence and i think its clear that they do under an emergency doctrine would have an incentive to preserve the emergency or the appearance of emergency for for as long as for as long as possible and i i think the the state encourages people to call which of course they should do but in part the reason why people are encouraged to call is to is to create is to pass on is to pass on evidence so i dont think that even if even to the extent that the call is a a cry for help well the help is is seeking invitation of the of the legal system in the davis case of course it was an arrest in in this case the the statement was not a cry for help it was in response to the second inquiry by the police officer the police officer was was pressing and and i i think the the emergency doctrine simply simply cant if if there were an emergency doctrine i think its just badly founded and couldnt apply here if it please the court i believe crawford has brought us to a remarkable crossroads if the accusation in this case is allowed to secure a conviction without the state providing an opportunity for confrontation then the confrontation clause will be little more than a charade easily evated by state officers gathering evidence but if the court proclaims that a conviction cannot be based on an accusation made privately to a known police officer then it will take a long step to ensure that the confrontation right remains robust as the framers intended for centuries to come 
 what about the resemblance idea to get around your problem of course its not purely formal its purely formal plus those things that resemble whats purely formal 
 im not sure i quite understand 
 listen its purely the formal criteria plus anything thats the same now same is vague but its no vaguer than a lot of other things floating around here today 
 well 
 so what do you think of that 
 i i not much your honor 
 i i dont think an accusation to a known law enforcement officer is awfully vague any legal term will have some some vagueness around the edges but i dont think theres much resemblance is awfully vague i think what happened here resembled the inquisitorial practices in the key in the key in a key respect and i dont think the test your honor is proposing handles the message over the internet or or a letter the the tape made at the initiative of the of the witness i think it it utterly fails to get that because the the prosecutors arent involved but clearly the confrontation clause was written against the backdrop of private prosecution the system of private prosecution so it has to get those clauses i i think that this case can be resolved on those very narrow grounds without trying to establish the broad general meaning of the confrontation clause im im hoping that the court is building a framework for hundreds of years to to come and i think its more important that it be built right than that it be built quickly and so i think an important first step is to say an accusation to a known police officer whatever else is testimonial that clearly must be if there are no further questions im pleased to submit the case 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in osborn v haley mr grant 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the court of appeals misinterpreted the westfall act in a way that unfairly deprives tort plaintiffs of the most basic procedural protections routinely afforded in both federal and state courts that misinterpretation cannot be reconciled with the text and history of the statute the nature and operation of official immunity or the jurisdictional limitations of article iii accordingly the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed and this state law case should be remanded to the state courts where it rightfully belongs in the alternative the court of appeals judgment should be vacated for lack of appellate jurisdiction prior to the westfall act courts considered whether assuming the alleged acts occurred the federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment official in westfall v erwin this court added the additional requirement that the acts be undertaken with a discretionary function but invited congress to address the issue in responding with the westfall act congress did not change the basic rule that scope of employment sets the line for immunity indeed congress confirmed that rule in particular congress gave no hint that it was radically rewriting the rules to direct federal district courts to determine the merits of wholly state law claims in some sort of unprecedented summary proceeding 
 why is it a wholly state law claim if the principal matter is whether this federal employee is immune from suit thats the threshold question that has to be answered its determined wholly by federal law so you must get through that federal law gateway before you can go any place else in the suit 
 your honor that is true in perhaps a majority of westfall act cases but in cases like this and a significant and recurring subset of cases there is no federal law question because scope of employment simply is not at issue what the government does in those subset of cases is merely to assert the defense of he didnt do it or it never happened official 
 but that its not it never happened as though the federal employee was off in hong kong he was there on the premises he is claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of his authority it seems like its a question of phraseology that you are dealing with 
 with respect your honor that is not the case certainly in this case and in others the government has conceded that if respondent barry haley acted as alleged in the complaint he was acting outside the course and scope of his federal employment 
 but i think justice ginsburgs point and it concerns me as well is that the government is entitled to say that during the time the event occurred ie the firing he was on duty and he refrained from committing any unlawful act 
 your honor there may be cases where even if the acts occurred they were within the course and scope of the federal employment but in the case like this as in wood versus united states as in melo v hafer in the third circuit the government concedes because the law and the facts require the government and the employee to concede that if the alleged acts took place they were necessarily outside the scope of employment official 
 but the actual statutory language refers to acting within the scope of employment at the time of the incident and so a certification based on the view that at the time of the alleged incident he was acting entirely within his scope would seem to be within the language of the statute 
 your honor on its face the certification in this case as in others tracks the statutory language but when the governments position was examined in the district court it became apparent that the governments essential defense in fact supported by two declarations including the declaration of respondent haley was that he simply did not do the acts alleged 
 well but the question is what the district court should examine and the statute talks about the incident out of which the claim arose so that necessarily requires the government to look at the complaint see the incident out of which this claim arises whether or not the claim is true and to certify it 
 your honor 
 out of which the claim arose it seems to me is of some importance but the official dissenting judges in the first circuit case wood didnt think it was important im not sure they were right about that 
 your honor this court has consistently made a distinction between immunity and the merits starting in cases like mitchell versus forsyth in N and continuing through cases like richardson versus mcknight in N the court has consistently recognized that immunity is different from a defense on the merits its different from a defense of he didnt do it or it never happened and i would say that although the time of the incident is important that is only one of several factors certainly under kentucky law in determining whether something happened within the course and scope of employment 
 well how is it i mean that line is awfully difficult to draw you assert he didnt do it versus something else but its easy lets say its an assault case and the person says you hit me and the person says well it was entirely an accident i was gesticulating with my hand so it wasnt wouldnt have met the requirements for the tort now are they denying the incident in that case 
 your honor the court in wood v united states took account of the possibilities of official artful pleading and would allow the government to challenge the characterization of the incident 
 but its not just a characterization if its something that has for example a mental element the plaintiff can assert you did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can say no i didnt now is that a characterization or is that a denial of the incident 
 i believe thats a characterization your honor 
 why isnt it the denial of an element of the claim theres no recovery for assault if the mental element is what the chief justice just described in his hypo and if in fact that is an element of the claim how do you draw a distinction between that and the existence or nonexistence of any act at all 
 there are your honor certain cases in which 
 well im not asking about certain cases i just want to know analytically how you do it or how you think we are supposed to do it 
 there are cases in which the merits and the immunity defense overlap and in those cases the district courts are fully empowered to make official factual findings 
 well in this case the immunity defense is number one as you said the government forthrightly said at the beginning right in terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope of his employment secondarily as you said the government in effect elaborated on that and said the reason he was not acting outside the scope of his employment is that these acts which would have been outside scope didnt happen why is that any different from the claim in the chief justices hypo that there was no intent to harm 
 your honor because a claim of that the alleged act did not occur that he didnt do it is not a claim of immunity again this 
 its a claim upon which the immunity depends the immunity is claimed the immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he was not acting outside the scope of his employment the reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he didnt do what they say he did 
 your honor im sorry if i have the same answer to the question but again this courts jurisprudence has consistently distinguished between defenses so to speak on the merits a claim that the official alleged act did not occur that one of the elements of the state law claim is not met 
 in this case if mr haley had said i had some conversations with the private employer and the plaintiffs name was mentioned during the conversations but i never told them to discharge her would this would that be something would your argument apply there 
 it would apply your honor if if that factual determination were relevant to scope of employment under the applicable law namely the agency law of kentucky 
 well is it i mean thats the problem that i have with your argument mr grant is that in life things are often not it happened or it didnt happen there is a middle ground which is this officer is saying i was there at the relevant time or place and when i was there everything that i did was within the scope of my employment i didnt do anything that was outside the scope of my employment 
 there are cases in which there is a middle ground your honor but this case is not one of them and there is certainly a distinct and recurring subset of cases like wood and melo and official kimbro where it is conceded on the facts and the law that if the actions occurred they occurred outside the scope of employment 
 i dont understand why anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to come out why would it make any sense to give a federal employee the benefit of trial in federal court when he committed the act and then you debate about whether it was whether there was liability or not and yet deprive him of the benefit of a federal court when he denies that he did anything at all why would you want one set of cases to remain in the state court and the other set of cases to go to federal court 
 your honor its congress that set the line at scope of employment 
 well i mean thats what we are debating whether the line is there or not and as you have seen from the discussion there is at least some ambiguity in it there being ambiguity why should we find a line that doesnt make any sense 
 well your honor i believe that line does make sense because if the governments view is adopted and the view of the majority of the court of appeals the merits of the wholly state law claim will be resolved in federal court and resolved in a official procedural context that denies a tort plaintiff the right to discovery that denies the tort plaintiff a right to the normal evidentiary presumptions on a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment and denies that tort plaintiff the right to a jury trial 
 but that can happen when in fact the certification of the attorney general turns out to be wrong and there isnt any immunity still the whole thing is going to be tried in federal court 
 your honor in that situation the merits will at least be tried under the normal provisions for discovery and evidentiary presumptions even if it does ultimately proceed against the united states 
 but mr grant im a little puzzled why is the discovery in the federal system any less valuable in the state system 
 because what the government advocates here as i think most starkly illustrated by the third circuits decision in melo v hafer is some sort of summary proceeding that takes place before the normal processes of federal litigation after all its the governments position that this employee is immune 
 isnt that only summary for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was official proper 
 its for the purpose of deciding scope of employment but the governments interpretation of that phrase encompasses essentially the merits of the case 
 its not for deciding whether removal i thought the statute says that the attorney generals certification is conclusive with respect to removal 
 it is conclusive your honor in those cases that truly do implicate scope of employment in this case by contrast the certification was essentially to raise the he didnt do it or it never happened defense 
 well what does it mean to say that the certification is conclusive with respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal if it doesnt mean that its conclusive if you are going to have judicial review that is going to address the question of removal as opposed to the validity of the certification on the merits 
 your honor its conclusive where it satisfies the definition in the statute what is conclusive in the final sentence of paragraph of section N is this certification and this official certification of course is the one referred to earlier in that paragraph 
 so you are saying its only conclusive if its right 
 no your honor its only it can be conclusive right or wrong but its only conclusive if it satisfies the statutory definition being about scope of employment not about the merits in this case for example there never will be never could be a true scope of employment determination the government having conceded it 
 suppose mr grant that the district court had said im going to deny the substitution of the united states as the defendant but i realize that this is a debatable question so im not going to order a remand until the defendant and the united states have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling that i deny the substitution of the united states suppose that it had happened that way would you have any right to get back in the state court wouldnt that properly go to a court of appeals 
 your honor that that could certainly go to the court of appeals under the discretionary appeal procedure in section N or perhaps by mandamus official 
 well suppose that happened and then the court of appeals said the united states should have been substituted 
 that would that would on its merits restrict the district court from remanding but of course in this case the district court did enter an order of remand based on its interpretation of section N 
 but your position is that the attorney generals certification is conclusive is not conclusive in those situations in which the attorney general doesnt draw the line properly between an event denying answer and an event characterizing answer whenever the attorney general is wrong on that very nuanced decision in some instances then the attorney generals certification is not conclusive 
 the short answer is yes your honor the attorney generals certification is not conclusive where it does not satisfy the statutory definition where it is not a certification that truly implicates scope of employment we have tried to draw the distinction between an unauthorized or improper certification one that doesnt meet the statutory definition and a certification as as the court in aliota versus graham said was wrong or erroneous on its official merits so to speak on the facts on the law of state agency law 
 mr grant these items we have been discussing are perhaps the more important features of the case but your argument in your brief didnt begin with those it began with the assertion that there is no jurisdiction to review the district courts remand order at all i take it you are not abandoning that are you 
 absolutely not your honor 
 then why was it first in your brief and not first in your argument 
 it was first in my brief because this court ordered me to brief and address it and i was happy to do so the court of appeals in fact did lack jurisdiction in this case this court has made clear as recently as the kircher opinion last term that section N means what it says and in this case the district court entered an order remanding the case to the state court from which it was removed and N of course bars review of that order by appeal or otherwise 
 there is at least considerable tension with N though and N in that that specifically says that for official purposes of removal the attorney generals certification is conclusive and it doesnt if you look at N it suggests youd think that case would proceed in federal court rather than be immediately remanded without the availability of review 
 your honor on the merits of the interpretation of N we tried to explain why conclusive does not operate in a case like this but i think the important point for jurisdiction is that this court has consistently said that even if a district court misinterprets a jurisdictional statute that review is nonetheless barred by section N 
 this is a different type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern on congresss part here to provide a federal forum for the adjudication of whether something is within the scope of a federal employees duty its not inconceivable but it would seem illogical to specifically provide for review of that determination but then have that review take place in state court rather than federal court 
 well your honor congress obviously knows how to make exceptions to section N i believe it was footnote eight of this courts opinion in kircher that cited a number of official examples the government in its brief relied on N usc section N and that statute which involved the resolution trust corporation specifically refers to appeal and remand and so what this court has said is the bar of section N which has been around for more than a century is not to be ignored unless there is a clear statutory command that makes an exception 
 but here not only not only does it say that the attorney generals certification is conclusive for purposes of removal but there is no mention about remand in relation to a case that is removed after the attorney generals certification whereas by contrast where the attorney general doesnt certify and the case is removed the statute does address the issue of remand so if you put those two things together isnt it perfectly clear that congress did not want these cases that are removed on the attorney generals certification to be remanded 
 no your honor the authority to remand in this case proceeds from subsection c of section N as this court has said in various cases including the international primate protection league case in N when a federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because a case a party attempting to remove has done so without authority to do official so section N obliges a remand 
 i would have thought your answer would have been even if even if the remand was improper even if it is the case that what is it envisions that the suit remain in the federal court nonetheless if there is an erroneous remand it is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of review i mean we said in other cases that even when the remand is wrong the remand is not reviewable 
 that is my answer your honor section goes gives direction to district courts but section N gives direction to appellate courts 
 if thats your answer can i go back to the other main issue for a second i would have thought that your case unfortunately for you in my mind is the classic case where there should be jurisdiction because the ag is supposed to say look i dont think anything happened okay so he was doing his job all day but if something did happen i will tell you what it was within the scope of his employment and apparently thats just what they did say here and then it got mixed up in the courts below in other words if he made some phone calls and even if he mentioned the employee even if he said something improper it was within the scope of his employment official which is just what they said so because of that it seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of nothing now you explain what your answer is 
 your honor with respect i believe the attorney general said just the opposite that 
 in the district court he didnt say if something happened here it was in the scope of his employment i thought he had maybe he hadnt i thought he had but i will ask him that 
 your honor 
 in the district court i thought he said that 
 the attorney generals submission the governments submission in the district court was that nothing happened 
 well it was there first but you can argue in the defense alternative i think nothing happened but if the plaintiff can convince a jury otherwise fine but then what they can convince him of is within the scope of his employment now did that happen in the district court that they said something like that or not 
 your honor the government did make what it called an alternative argument official 
 well why cant they do that which is just what wood says they can do if anybody you know thinks thats valid but the whats the problem then because i would have thought that the reason this case appears difficult is because yours is a case where the ag should be able to come in and remove it 
 the district court the very same district court that the government so so desperately wants to review the facts of this case said that given mr haleys declaration under penalty of perjury it would not accept that alternative 
 but its wrong in that isnt it 
 well the government did not appeal that point in the court of appeals and in fact 
 i mean the wood issue was the issue of where if anything happened of course its outside the scope its like one employee shoots another you know there is nothing to do with scope of employment there its plainly outside and of course this act in my view then then was that this is not an act that allows the ag to defend that kind of thing but if its arguable at least that something happened if it happened at all it was within the scope of official employment the ag can defend it 
 your honor the government 
 whats the problem with there should be a problem with what i say from your point of view so 
 i think the problem is in the record your honor and the governments brief at the at the petition stage on page N in note five quotes its own appellate brief in the court of appeals and that brief says the memorandum of understanding between the forest service and the private respondent showed that if haley did cause the contractor to fire osborn he acted outside the scope of his employment and the court of appeals quite logically took that 
 so you are saying they have abandoned the argument 
 they have your honor and the court of appeals recognized that on page N a of the petition appendix if the court has no further questions id like to reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you mr grant mr hallwarddriemeier 
 mr chief justice official and may it please the court in the westfall act congress provided an absolute immunity for federal employees for acts taken within the scope of their employment and it went further and provided that when the attorney general certifies that the employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose that that issue of federal immunity is to be decided by the federal court it is the attorney generals assertion of this federal defense of immunity that satisfies article iii just as the employees own assertion of immunity satisfies article iii under the federal officer removal statute and just as a in other circumstances a plaintiffs assertion of a claim under federal law satisfies article iii 
 so what if the attorney general certifies and removes a case in a criminal case a case clearly not within the statute what happens then 
 well i think that the the that would probably be a defect in removal procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even if it is 
 no no on the official procedure he follows the procedure meticulously its just wrong its a criminal case the statute says he can do it in a civil case on the other hand the statute also says that his certification is conclusive 
 well your honor even if that is a case that would be removed without jurisdiction that case is quite different from this case because this case 
 yes this one is a civil one and thats a criminal but im just trying to understand how broad your argument that this is not subject to further review goes 
 well the issue that is not subject to further review for purposes of jurisdiction is the attorney generals certification that the employee was acting within scope the statute doesnt provide that the attorney generals certification that it is a civil action is conclusive but only the attorney generals certification that the employee was acting within scope is conclusive for purposes of removal thats the essential element of the federal defense and thats what satisfies article iii jurisdiction and in fact this court in the willingham case recognized that an employee could assert a claim of federal immunity even though he was also at official the same time denying that he caused any harm to the plaintiff 
 well i thought your analogy to willingham was a strong one until you go back and read the statute willingham is a very different statutory predicate its acting under color of law this is much more specific at the time of the incident he was acting within his scope so im not sure the analogy holds up 
 well if anything the language of the westfall act is broader because as your honor emphasized earlier the statute the westfall act provides that the attorney general is to certify that at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose the employee was acting within the scope so arguably the necessary question is what was the employee doing at the time the federal officer removal statute is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim arise out of the the acts taken under color of office 
 but yet that would be a good argument if the statute said the attorney general can certify that the employee did not do anything outside the scope of his employment but its phrased in the affirmative he has to certify that he was acting within the scope of his employment official 
 thats right and thats what the attorney general did here certified that mr haley was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose and as several 
 so thats the issue then and what i is my my question for you is this lets imagine not this case which as i said i think is too complicated and probably is one that the government should be able to defend but suppose its an assault like woods a sexual assault and there is absolutely no doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of employment everybody concedes it but government and the governments position is nothing happened all right nothing happened you say government would you like to argue that if something happened and they may be able to prove something something like a movement no we agree there was nothing like that we agree nothing like that happened we are not going to defend on any scope of employment ground all we are arguing is that ordinary work went on and that was within the scope of employment now does this act cover it or not your view is yes and you read you know i thought it was a close question but you read what i thought the other way in wood though it was obviously a close official question so what is your basic response to that 
 you are correct that our view is that yes the attorney general can certify in that case the issue is really one along a continuum as i think your honor has recognized of on on the one extreme one might say that the attorney general must accept all of the plaintiffs allegations as true and and i dont think that anybody here is arguing that 
 that was the position of the district court though wasnt it 
 that was the position of the district court although i dont think the petitioner is now advocating that view and that view would certainly be inconsistent it would create the anomaly that the attorney generals authority to certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of the employee would be narrower than the employees own authority to assert the immunity because again going back to the willingham case the court never asked whether it would be within the scope of employment for the prison officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner rather the defense was we didnt harm the prisoner but anything that happened between us and the prisoner happened within the scope of our employment and so the official attorney generals authority to certify has to be at least as broad as that in our view 
 the basic point i think in wood is this im the district judge and the government you come in and argue in the alternative nothing happened but if it did happen it was within the scope of employment and they say there is no possibility youd say plaintiff i want to know here if there is a reasonable chance maybe any chance that a jury could find that something went on here that was within the scope of employment that shouldnt have and if the answer to that question is no the defendant wins either because of summary judgment or because no sorry i have gotten lost in what i said do you follow it 
 the i think i do in our view 
 all right good im glad that someone did 
 in our view it would be anomalous that the that the more innocent employee would be deprived of the benefits of the westfall act and if i could use a more simple 
 i was talking really about official practicality of it i dont think you can give me a case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge to decide because im going to ask you the government to tell me if anything went on here that might have been within the scope of employment and i look at what you are saying if you say no if you say no you cant defend it if you say yes you can defend it and thats going to be the end of it as long as your view is based on a reasonable reading of the record 
 well i dont think that that could be the end of it as justice ginsburg pointed out reality is much murkier than the black or white and even in the hypothetical that your honor poses it is quite possible that as the case progresses the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee was acting within the scope or not if i could use a simple example of assault if the if a supervisor is dressing down her employee for for inadequate work the employee then sues the supervisor alleging that she assaulted her shaking her fist right under her nose threatening harm to her even if that would be outside the scope of employment the employee might say the supervisor rather might say i never raised my hand at all i raised my voice official certainly but i never raised my hand a third party witness may say well i saw the supervisor wag her finger at the employee but not in a threatening fashion now 
 and as long as a jury could find that there is a view of the record such that the plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within the scope of employment such as finger wagging that hits her forehead for example you can defend it whats the problem 
 well if the employee 
 the only problem is if you admit that you cant prove anything like that 
 if the employee was acting within the scope of the employment when she wagged a finger then a fortiori she was acting within the scope of her employment when she didnt raise her hand at all 
 no not a fortiori for the reason that congress wrote this statute not to give the defendant the right to call in the government to defend him no matter what he did the reason that congress wrote the statute was to repeal the westfall case which was a question of the scope of immunity which was the question of the scope of government responsibility to official take away that limited determination in westfall that was the only point congress could have written a statute the way whats your response to that 
 but congress made established an absolute immunity where the employee was acting within the scope of employment and petitioner agrees that scope of employment is the essential question for immunity so if in my hypothetical the supervisor was acting within the scope of her employment when she dressed down raising her voice but not raising her fist her her subordinate then she is protected by the westfall act from a claim arising out of the context of that employment 
 but what happens in a case where the certification is clearly wrong i mean you get into a fight with your neighbor its got nothing to do with your employment at all but the attorney general certifies that it does you know they are always thinking about your cases you must have been thinking about it at the time that certification goes into the district court the district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous throws it out then that state law assault case proceeds in federal court 
 your honor the official congress enacted the westfall act against the presumption of regularity of federal officials and that is of course what this court has often said as well and so i dont think we should construe the statute on the presumption that the attorney general would would certify ridiculous cases 
 well what about the lamagno where the question was was the employee working within the scope of his employment or was he off on a frolic of his own i think thats the kind of question that the chief justice put to you the certification if it were wrong the attorney general said what he was doing was within the scope of employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with his friends and they got in his car and killed someone if that certification within the scope was wrong and instead he is on a frolic of his own then the united states isnt substituted 
 thats right that would mean that the district court did not on the merits ultimately uphold the defense of immunity but as the court said in mesa the merits of the immunity defense have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of jurisdiction 
 i thought that that case official was about was the certification reviewable 
 thats right lamagno was about whether the certification was reviewable your honor is also correct about the facts of that case one of the points of dispute between the government and the plaintiffs there was whether mr lamagno was drunk at the time of the accident and and the attorney general certified on his understanding that mr lamagno was not drunk and that was upheld by the district court on remand after some discovery and summary judgment type litigation 
 but the court said that that could be reviewed 
 thats right it can be reviewed and the attorney generals certification is not conclusive for purposes of the substitution 
 right 
 it is conclusive for purposes of the courts removal jurisdiction 
 what does that mean does that mean that if the district court finds that in fact the defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment the united states is eliminated as the defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted 
 yes your honor official thats what happened but and in that 
 where where does that come from 
 well the procedure for what happens upon the district courts review is not spelled out in the westfall act neither is the review itself in particular but the the employee 
 maybe the united states should remain the party defendant and the united states should pay which would be the you know the price of the attorney generals certification he should be careful what he certifies 
 well the uniform view of the lower courts is that when the certification is overturned the effect is to resubstitute the employee as the defendant and it proceeds in federal court as a pendent claim the attorney generals assertion of the defense of immunity which we presume to be colorable because we presume regularity by the attorney general confers article iii jurisdiction on the courts even though it may ultimately on the merits be rejected this court held in the carnegiemellon case that the district courts have discretion whether to exercise jurisdiction over pendent claims once the federal question has been resolved if the courts have official discretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction then certainly congress can instruct them to exercise that 
 well they wouldnt have discretion in that case though because the statute says the attorney generals certification is conclusive for purposes of removal 
 thats right congress has removed the discretion in this class of cases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction 
 i thought maybe your answer one alternative answer would have been that you cant remand the case but you can still dismiss it 
 well the perhaps perhaps thats so certainly carnegiemellon 
 it would still be conclusive for purposes of removal but it doesnt mean its conclusive for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction 
 by its text the statute speaks to removal and that the attorney generals certification is conclusive for purposes of removal but i think 
 couldnt it be conclusive for purposes of removal jurisdiction but still leave the district court with discretion to remand on the official grounds that although it had removal jurisdiction in fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong and it would therefore remand in effect because the only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a pendent claim 
 but the as the court held in carnegiemellon a remand of pendent claims after the federal issue has been resolved is not a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of N rather it is a discretionary remand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction and so 
 in that case it would be reviewable 
 and it would be reviewable thats why thats one of the reasons why the district courts order here is reviewable because it is not an order of remand authorized by N because first of all congress has instructed the courts that they are not to remand 
 thats thats what the district court said it was though isnt it didnt it wasnt the district court remanding for lack of jurisdiction 
 it is certainly official true that the district court 
 so you want us to review the the assertion of the district court that it was remanding for i mean that would mean every case would would be reviewable 
 no your honor because here the court need not go beyond the face of the district courts order to understand what it was doing the court exercised jurisdiction over the federal question that was properly brought before it by the attorney generals certification and this courts decision in lamagno after resolving that the district court said having concluded that the united states is not a proper party to this case the court must now determine whether or not it has jurisdiction and it also said that the absence of the us as a party to the case destroys the courts jurisdiction so its evident that the court understood that it had jurisdiction and that it was a subsequent event that deprived it 
 let me go back to the chief justices hypo a little earlier could the district judge at that point dismiss the case without prejudice to refiling in the state court 
 i dont think that that would be consistent with congresss intent the official in all of the government 
 it would be consistent with the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the case 
 that is true but i think that the intent of congress was the same as this court all the members of this court recognized in lamagno in lamagno even the dissenters the plurality all acknowledged what congress intended by the conclusive for purposes of removal language was to prevent the shuttling back and forth of the case once it was removed it was to stay in federal court that was what congress intended and one reason 
 then its more than pendent jurisdiction because pendent jurisdiction leaves it up to the federal court to either retain the state claim or send it back so this is what you are suggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction 
 thats right by pendent jurisdiction what what i meant to convey was that it is within the courts article iii jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims that were pendent to a federal claim under this courts judicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction that is discretionary with the court but if it is official discretionary with the court then certainly congress can mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction and that it would be consistent with article iii but another reason why congress would have wanted the case to remain in federal court even if the certification is overturned is as we have alluded to before the development of the case subsequent to the certification substitution decision may may illustrate that the plaintiffs claim does indeed assert facts that were within the scope of employment the court would at the very 
 well the jurisdiction wouldnt depend on that justice ginsburgs point that theres more than pendent jurisdiction here i take it is because these are not separate state claims appended to what you thought was a federal claim this is the same claim that you initially thought was a federal claim and then it turned into a purely state law claim and that may be analyzed quite differently for purposes of jurisdiction 
 no the case is i think not distinguishable from removals under the federal officer removal statute where congress has indicated that it is the federal defense that confers jurisdiction rather than the federal claim then the official ultimate merits of the federal defense are irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue and the court 
 so you are saying there are two claims one claim is raised by the defense and if you look at that claim which is by definition federal then its fair to look at the original state claim by analogy as a pendent claim 
 yes 
 is that fair 
 yes your honor 
 what happens if the attorney general doesnt certify and it goes to state court i take it one of the concerns we have here is that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the certification is wrong and if its in federal court suppose that there is a denial of certification then under 
 the employee can ask for a certification decision i take it thats a federal law defense that the or a federal law point that the state court must hear and so now we are back in state court 
 yes 
 and we still dont have a official jury trial and if thats so im not sure if that helps you or helps the petitioner 
 well i think that your honors point illustrates that this issue of federal law is one that congress has mandated be resolved at the outset by the judge and if the employee petitions for certification over the attorney generals objection the statute allows the attorney general to remove the petition to federal court and the statute states that the district court shall find and certify whether the employee was acting within the scope 
 but in my case i guess i dont think it ever gets to district court because theres no certification but then the employee can ask the state court to have a bench trial on the scope of employment am i right about that 
 he can you are correct it is at the option of the attorney general under to remove the case at that point so that the review of his noncertification happens in federal court in stark contrast to provides that if the district court holds that the attorney general was correct that the employee was not acting within the scope the case is to be remanded to state court so the presence of the remand official 
 but my point is i suppose the government can just say we are not going to make the certification and we are not going to remove 
 yes 
 so then the state court still has to have the bench trial on the scope of employment 
 thats right 
 im not sure if that helps it seems to me that might be an argument for limiting the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench trials in almost every case 
 the i think what that illustrates is that congress wanted the issue of immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the court and one reason that that is so essential under the westfall act ftca scheme is that if the immunity if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of the employee that has many many consequences including that the united states is the proper defendant exclusive jurisdiction lies in the federal court the case must be dismissed until an administrative claim is filed and that avenue is exhausted all of these procedural and substantive official defenses come into play depending on how the scope of employment issue is resolved 
 right but thats the strongest argument i thought the other way initially that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of his own that you resolve in a bench trial if the answer he was okay it stays in the federal court anyway i understand that but if you are going to take your position whether say its a sexual assault as it was in wood and the question is well was there a sexual assault or not and if there was its clearly outside of the scope of employment well then you are going to have all these things resolved in a bench trial and actually its supposed to normally be before a jury for example 
 is that so if the employee is resubstituted its going on now the united states is not a party just the federal employee but its staying in federal court under this pendent jurisdictionlike theory wouldnt either party be entitled to a jury trial 
 yes yes your honor i think justice breyers question though had to do with the procedure at the certification review stage that is to be done by the district court sitting official without jury and thats because under the statute the attorney generals certification has the legal effect of making the united states the defendant the united states the action shall be deemed an action against the united states and the united states shall be substituted and that is true unless and until the certification is overturned and there is of course no seventh amendment right to jury trial against the united states 
 mr grant could i come back for im sorry i have the wrong counsel mr hallwarddriemeier 
 i will respond to anything your honor 
 what is your response to the application of N you say that it does not apply where its apparent on the face that the remand is improper 
 that the remand was not one of the remands authorized by N 
 right right 
 not just that it was erroneous 
 wouldnt somebody always be able to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case official 
 no your honor 
 and wouldnt that destroy the whole purpose of N which is to stop this pingpong 
 no your honor i think not and we have two arguments that both the issues substitution and remand are appealable one is a very specific one and that is that congress has categorically taken this kind of remand outside the courts authority under N by specifically prohibiting remand at all in N and that argument of course would not have relevance i dont think much beyond this case and this court has recognized that congress can exempt a certain class of orders from the scope of N and without crossreferencing those provisions in the rice case the court said that that specific removal provision did not purport to impair or restrict the application of the then equivalents of N and but clearly N does purport to impair the authority to remand by making the certification conclusive for purposes of removal so with that as our narrowest argument 
 but the response to that is that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is official nonetheless governed by N there are a lot of erroneous remands and this would just be just be another one 
 but when congress specifically prohibited the courts from remanding a case under N it certainly did not mean to protect a court that ignored that mandate from review 
 isnt the problem and maybe im missing and i may be missing something here but isnt the problem with your argument is that the statute didnt come out and say you cant remand the statute said for purposes of removal the certification is conclusive and that allows for the kind of dichotomy that you and i were talking with before a court can say look i know that i have article iii jurisdiction here but in point of fact i am i am remanding because what you and i are calling here the pendent claim does not support any of the governments theory if thats the case then under N there could be a review of it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling but if on the contrary the judge said as i think the judge said here i am remanding because based on this analysis i do not have jurisdiction ie the judge went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is conclusive that is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling official and as justice scalia said we have said over and over again however erroneous it may be it is not reviewable 
 if i may your honor i think two things one that there is a difference between congress categorically prohibiting a certain kind of remand and saying that a remand was simply erroneous and secondly that that argument would not go to our argument that under waco at the very least the order on substitution is appealable because it is separate and independent from remand 
 thank you counsel mr grant you have four minutes remaining 
 thank you as to jurisdiction congress knows how to make an exception to section N all of the examples cited by the court in kircher and by the government in its brief specifically referred used the terms appeal and remand the statute here contains neither of those terms 
 well there was nothing expressed about thermtron and yet we recognized an exception there 
 your honor thermtron was a case official where the district court did not even purport to be relying on one of the grounds enumerated in section N namely lack of subject matter jurisdiction in this case of course the district court explicitly cited both that statute and used the term subject matter jurisdiction and the government itself is is not willing to go behind that on the merits the government has argued this morning that the westfall act provides a federal forum to assert a federal defense of immunity the government has analogized this statute to section N which allows the assertion of a colorable federal defense but the defense of he didnt do it it never happened is not a federal defense it is not a defense of immunity 
 how about the defense of i was on the job and everything i did on the job was within the scope of my employment 
 in certain cases your honor that could be a defense of immunity but in a class of cases identified by justice breyer there will be an admission there has to be an admission under the facts and the law that even if the alleged acts occurred it was outside the scope of employment in that case the defense is purely a merits defense and i think for this court to say otherwise in this case would require official overruling or being contradictory to over N years of official immunity jurisprudence where the court has consistently distinguished between immunity defenses and defenses on the merits where certainly the lower courts have taken that conceptual distinction and said a defense that the alleged acts did not occur do not raise an immunity defense and so the assertion of a defense in that case on the merits is not the assertion of a federal defense it is not sufficient to confer federal jurisdiction under article iii it does not meet the definition of a statute of the statute which uses the phrase scope of employment no fewer than seven times there is no indication that congress in the westfall act intended to change the normal rules that purely state law defenses such as he didnt do it were to be decided in a federal forum 
 but then you are left with this question justice scalia raised if its ambiguous an employee says i did everything within the scope of my employment i did nothing improper they allege i did something improper i didnt i was a faithful servant the negligent employee will be allowed the federal forum but the one who was a loyal careful employee has to be in the state court does that make any sense official 
 your honor i think thats with respect a misunderstanding of how the statute works the employee who acts within the scope of his employment whether or not he did the acts alleged gets immunity the employee who acts outside of the scope of employment 
 this is an employee who said i never did one thing that was inconsistent with my federal employment 
 thats an employee who should win on the merits and will win on the merits as justice kennedy recognized there are certain applications that allow the state court to resolve even a federal defense we should trust that state courts will resolve state law defenses in a manner fair to their own citizens as well 
 thank you mr grant the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in whorton versus bockting general chanos 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court crawford v washington should not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review because it fails to meet the exacting standards for retroactivity established by this court in teague versus lane in addition respondent is not entitled to relief under aedpa teague held that new rules of criminal generally should not apply to cases on collateral review unless they fall within one of two narrow exceptions the second exception at issue here is for those new watershed rules of criminal procedure without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished rules that alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair proceeding crawford is not a watershed rule of criminal procedure 
 could you give an example general chanos of one that is other than gideon is there any other one or 
 the only example that this court has pointed to in its N years of retroactivity jurisprudence is gideon versus wainwright 
 and none other occurs to you 
 none other occurs to me at this time none of the cases that this court has ruled are not retroactive would i find to be retroactive or watershed and i certainly dont find crawford to be watershed crawford is not watershed because it is not a rule without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished and it is not a rule which altered our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair proceeding 
 i take it from your presentation you think we do have to go through the teague analysis we cant just rely on N 
 no chief justice roberts i believe that you could go straight to N and bar relief under N 
 well then what do you do about N or i guess which seems to suggest at different rule if a case is made retroactive 
 well N provides a cause and prejudice opportunity in the event that the state court denies relief on a procedural basis rather than a substantive basis and the petitioner can show cause and prejudice under N the federal court could then look at the petitioners claim because no merits determination had been made by the state court and finding the cause and prejudice elements under N the federal court would not be precluded from making a merits determination since the and conceivably applying a rule that had been made retroactive active under teague because the state court had not made a substantive merits determination 
 now my point was that looking at it says is the decision contrary to established law and i would have thought that if its a new decision its clearly not contrary to established law 
 correct 
 but on the other hand you look at and it says heres what you do if you are applying a new decision thats that been made retroactive so i would have thought that meant you cant say simply because its a new decision it wont apply 
 our reading of N is that congress intended to have the federal courts give the state courts deference to the extent that the state courts made a substantive determination if the state courts made no substantive determination theres no requirement for deference by the federal courts which under N the federal court conceivably find that there was cause and prejudice under N under the standards enumerated in those subparagraphs and and could then make a merits determination there would be nothing that would preclude the federal court from making a merits determination so long as the state court had not already made a merits determination 
 well suppose the state has which is going straight to aedpa does that mean that teague is out entirely even the first category that is a decision a substantive decision that would mean that what defendant did was not a crime 
 yes justice ginsburg it would mean under under a plain meaning reading of N if the state court made a determination on the merits it would bar subsequent federal review whether it was a substantive a substantive claim or a procedural claim however in atkins v kentucky there would be nothing that would prevent the petitioner from going back to the state court and arguing cause and prejudice and then if the state court were to make a procedural determination on the second petition that was that were to deny the petitioner his claim he could take that to the federal court the federal court could then look at that because it was only a procedural determination by the state court on the second habeas claim and the federal court at that point could look back at the substantive rule as established law because on the second claim they have the right if hes only denied a procedure on a procedural basis theres nothing that would preclude the federal court on his second claim from looking back at what would then be established law 
 what is the source of the rule in teague could congress overturn the rule in teague if it wanted to and say that nothing is retroactive or that everything is retroactive 
 my understanding is that the rule in teague is the source is not the us constitution its a judicially created rule that began with linkletter and developed into teague and its progeny and yes i believe congress could pass N and alter the habeas procedures as they have in enacting N 
 habeas is an equitable 
 im sorry 
 habeas is equitable relief and the court has a lot of discretion in identifying the boundaries of equitable relief doesnt it 
 yes justice scalia 
 i assume thats how we got to teague 
 let me ask this question as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying on teague or the statute if you are relying just on the statute how would it apply to a case which was correct under established law at the time that the state court made its ruling but before the case reached the appellate court in which there was a change in our interpretation what if this case if crawford had been decided while the case was on appeal 
 while under the courts retroactivity jurisprudence griffith would control under N it would not N would control 
 so it really makes a difference whether we rely on teague or whether we rely on the statute if we disagree with you 
 it make difference it makes a difference 
 well i assume there would be a rule N motion or the equivalent of it in state court 
 yes 
 if indeed our law had changed dont you think 
 absolutely 
 i mean its inconceivable that the problem wouldnt be solved in some fashion by the state court that rendered the decision 
 i believe that the petitioner would be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at the state court level and if they were somehow denied relief on a procedural basis there would be nothing that would preclude the federal court from granting them relief thereafter 
 thats a odd position to take to proliferate proceedings that way i mean i thought your argument aedpa argument was too bad the federal court is out of it but the state court is most likely recognizing that this court has said what this man did wasnt a crime to grant him relief but if you are making this twostep and saying but somehow we can change the substantive proceeding into a procedural proceeding that seems to me odd to proliferate proceedings that way 
 justice ginsburg what we are saying is that congress in enacting N was stating that the federal courts should give deference to the state court decision so long as it is a merits decision and so long as it complies with existing clearly established law and is not unreasonable and if that occurs then congress under N was saying give state courts deference under those circumstances 
 you are saying not just clearly then clearly established law 
 thats exactly 
 that is at the time of the state court decision end steno 
 exactly absolutely at the time of the state court decision in fact if you look at the language of N it says resulted in a decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law it doesnt say is contrary to clearly established law it says was contrary to 
 the word was is somewhat ambiguous it could either mean at the time of the trial courts decision or at the time of the final judgment on appeal 
 well in either case it is referring to the 
 i know you win under either view but 
 yes exactly 
 it could mean either of those two things 
 our our position would be that it would be up to when the decision became final whatever the law was up to the time that the decision the state court decision became final that is what was clearly established law i will continue with our teague analysis because we believe that the claim is barred under either analysis the 
 crawford did use the term bedrock 
 yes yes and what crawford what we believe crawford was saying well crawford said that the sixth amendment right to confrontation is bedrock it didnt say that that decision altered our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair trial that is the standard not whether or not the sixth amendment is bedrock in fact if you look at the case of gideon versus wainwright and betts versus brady in betts versus brady this court had held the sixth amendment right to counsel was not applicable to the states through the N th amendment gideon overruled betts versus brady and said that the sixth amendment right to counsel was applicable to the states under the N th amendment that alters our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements that are essential to a fair trial in one case we are saying rights of counsel is not one of those bedrock procedural elements is not therefore applicable to the states under the N th amendment betts versus brady in the next case we are saying right to counsel is it implicit in the constitution it is an essential to the fairness of a proceeding and it is therefore applicable to the states under the N th amendment that truly alters our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements that are essential to a fair trial in contrast when you look at crawford visavis ohio versus roberts the theres a real distinction there in both cases we know that the right to confrontation is essential and federal and one of those bedrock elements that are essential to a fair proceeding therefore crawford doesnt alter our understanding of what elements are or are not essential to bedrock elements essential to a fair proceeding instead it modifies the contours 
 you make the same analysis if you say the right is not necessarily the right of confrontation but the narrower right of crossexamination 
 would i make the same analysis 
 because that is central to crawford 
 yes yes crawford doesnt tell us that the rights to confrontation or the right of crossexamination is a new right as gideon tells us instead crawford tells us 
 well there is a new emphasis on crossexamination 
 it alters it modifies the manner in which we implement that right under ohio versus roberts there was plenty of crossexamination that was occurring the standard under ohio versus roberts was unavailability and inadequate indicia of reliability there was a reliability screen in place and it was clear under ohio versus roberts that the right to confrontation was an essential bedrock right essential to a fair trial 
 exactly but you know how you play the game depends upon at what level of generality you describe the right and i agree with you if you describe the right as the right to crossexamination that that was reinstituted by crawford which said that the confrontation right is a right to confrontation to crossexamination which didnt exist before i mean you could dispense with that right of crossexamination if there were indicia of reliability 
 well there were 
 im not sure that you can so in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock principle frankly i dont know any formula that would that would describe it i really think it is a you know it when you see it 
 well justice scalia 
 it is like obscenity 
 i understand the other point that 
 that gets if you follow justice scalias argument that gets you to i think to the argument you have made and that is all right we have got to look at it pragmatically i mean what are the consequences of following a reliability model rather than a crossexamination model and your argument is consequences that are not necessarily more favorable to defendants in fact or more productive of ultimately reliable determinations in fact and that i take it is your basic point so i think you have answered what for all of us is a problem and that is we dont have a clear analytical definition of bedrock but if we look to consequences you have got an argument your friends dont think it is a good one but thats your point 
 the other point is that theres a second component to watershed which is it must be a rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is seriously diminished there was crossexamination under ohio versus roberts there in crawford the language of crawford isnt a sweeping indictment of of roberts 
 well there wasnt crossexamination by defense counsel 
 im sorry 
 in this case there wasnt crossexamination by defense counsel or am i incorrect 
 there was crossexamination of the mother there was crossexamination of the police detective there was crossexamination of 
 oh oh no i mean of the witness 
 not of autumn not of autumn bockting but the important point that i want to make before i reserve the balance of my time is that the question isnt simply is crawford accuracyenhancing the question is is it a rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is seriously diminished in other words must all 
 accuracyenhancing then 
 im sorry 
 its a question about how much more accuracyenhancing if at all 
 that and it is really an analysis of roberts is is that judicial determination of reliability under adequate indicia of reliability so fundamentally flawed that all of the decisions that were that were arrived at pursuant to its authority must be undone and new trials must occur with respect to those decisions because it is so fundamentally flawed and our point is that it is not it does not rise to that level of inadequacy and crawford is therefore not a rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is seriously diminished mr chief justice may i reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you general chanos mr gornstein we will hear now from you 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court crawford does not satisfy either of the two requirements for a retroactive watershed rule the application of roberts rather than crawford did not so seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate convictions as to require the wholesale reopening of convictions that were final before crawford was decided with all the societial costs that entails 
 since you barely cite aedpa i think you assume we need to reach the teague question before the aedpa question 
 mr chief justice we do not have an interest in the aedpa question because it does not apply to federal convictions the N and there is no federal conviction analog to N so we are not telling you that you should or should not reach it we just dont have an interest in that question 
 it is law that is applied in federal court though i assume you have an interest in that 
 well we have a general interest in the way law is applied in federal court but we do not ordinarily opine on issues just on that basis and we havent in the past opined on aedpa issues unless they have some federal analog carryover effect and we did not here now with respect to the reliability prong of the teague analysis there are three reasons that the roberts rule did not so seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate convictions as to call for retroactive application of crawford the first is that roberts had a builtin reliability screen hearsay could not be admitted under roberts unless a determination was made that there were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness the second reason that roberts did not seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate convictions is that there were other procedural components that operated in tandem with roberts to promote accuracy they included the right to crossexamine the witness through whom an hearsay statement was introduced the right to introduce your own evidence to challenge the reliability of the hearsay statement defense counsel could point out to the jury all the weaknesses in the hearsay statement and the defendant could count on the common sense of the jury to weigh the reliability of the hearsay statement in light of all the evidence in the case 
 cant you make that argument about any about crossexamination in general it is debatable whether how good crossexamination is in determining the truthfulness of a witnesss testimony now our constitution decides the issue one way but any infringement of crossexamination could be susceptible to the same argument that you are making 
 yes and i dont think that this is a selfsufficient argument for that reason it is just one component of the argument about why there was reliability the fact that there was a roberts screen on reliability is an additional factor that distinguishes my example from what you said and the fact is that there was a right to crossexamine live witnesses here so there was a right to crossexamine the police officer through whom this hearsay statement was made it is not a case where there was an acrosstheboard denial of any crossexamination 
 well i guess you are asking us to say crawford get one take one it is really not that important if thats so i suppose we shouldnt have overruled roberts 
 no i think crawford that is an important decision but if you made retroactive every one of your important decisions you would be reversing the rule of teague what teague says that is there is not that the purposes of habeas corpus are largely exhausted once somebody has received a trial in accordance with then existing law because of the importance of finality to the system and there are only going to be two very theres only a very narrow window for watershed rules of rules that the accuracy of proceedings beforehand are so seriously diminished that there is an unacceptably large risk that systematically innocent people were being convicted and that this is a rule that approaches gideon in its fundamental and sweeping importance those are the only circumstances in which the court is going to go back on finality 
 how many times have we dealt with a quote new rule with the argument made that it was watershed and therefore should be retroactive this is not the first time 
 no i think that there have been i dont know the exact number but maybe N or N about half of which are ones are proposed new rules and half of which are ones where the rule was already established previously and the question was whether it was going to be made retroactive and i cited in the brief there are three or four death penalty cases where the court had already established before each one of them there was a right not to be the death penalty to be arbitrarily imposed and in each case there was a new rule that built on that basic rule in an important way but in each case the court said it was not the kind of rule that was going to be applied retroactively and so too here the third reason i wanted to give about why there was not a serious diminishment in accuracy that is in at least one respect the roberts rule actually promotes more accuracy than the crawford rule and thats with respect to nontestimonial hearsay in the case of nontestimonial hearsay under roberts that could come in only if determination had been made there were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness whereas under the crawford rule that kind of nontestimonial hearsay comes in without any reliability check under the constitution at all 
 but thats not this case 
 well there was actually in this case the mothers testimony about what the daughter said to her 
 im talking about the daughters testimony 
 yes the daughters testimony about what she said to the mother illustrates the difference because that came in through the mother it only came in because there was a particularized guarantees of trustworthiness to that statement whereas under crawford in future trials statements to the mother which are not testimonial they will come in through the mother without any screen for reliability under the constitution at all so in that respect the defendant here got more by virtue of the roberts rule than by than he would have had by virtue of the crawford rule 
 is that the case in federal courts too 
 well it is a matter of interpreting what protection is left is only going to be by virtue of the residual hearsay rule so there will have to be some determination made about whether there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness 
 i mean it is conceivable that federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to require precisely that anyway 
 but justice scalia 
 in which case you shouldnt be making this argument because it applies only to state courts 
 no i think it applies equally to federal courts because it is free to the federal court system to devise a rule that would allow a looser standard of entry than the roberts standards and if it did that would be constitutional so there is an interest in that kind of argument in the federal system i wanted to move on to the bedrock aspect of the inquiry which is a separate second inquiry that had threshold that has to be crossed if you are going to find something to be watershed and the only rule that the court has found to be bedrock is gideon and this rule carawford does not approach gideon in its fundamental and sweeping importance and there are a couple of reasons for that first the right to counsel pervasively affected all aspects of the criminal trial whereas this focuses on one limited the admissibility of one limited category of evidence testimonial hearsay and adopts a somewhat new rule for that than had existed before the second thing is that under the right to counsel is deemed so essential to a fair trial that depriving someone of that right can never be discounted as harmless error whereas crawford errors can be harmless there are a significant number of cases where they are found to be harmless so you cannot say that a violation of the crawford rule always and necessarily results in an unfair trial whereas you can say that about the right to counsel finally the gideon rule established for the first time a right to free counsel in all felony criminal trials before crawford was established there was a right to crossexamine it simply was a different right you had a right to crossexamine the live witnesses and you had a right to screen out uncrossexamined statements unless they met the reliability standard of roberts and the change that was made was one in which the roberts rule was thrown out and you can no longer get in uncrossexamined statements with a determination of reliability but that is a modification or an incremental change in an existing right that previously existed to crossexamine and instead unlike the gideon rule which established the right to counsel for the first time if the court has nothing further 
 thank you mr gornstein ms forsman 
 thank you very much mr chief justice members of the court this man was sentenced to life in prison based upon accusations that have never been tested by the only constitutionally reliable test that is now acceptable in this court there is no question that the statements that were admitted through the police officer were testimonial there is no question that if mr bockting were tried today that those statements would not have come in the government has argued that the reliability screen socalled that came from roberts was sufficient and it was only an incremental change when the crawford decision was decided the fact of the matter is that this court found that the reliability screen that the government has discussed was fundamentally flawed and in this case comparing the right to counsel to the right to crossexamination is easy it is easy because it would not have mattered how many lawyers mr bockting had it would not have mattered if he had the finest lawyers in the country it would not have mattered if he was duke power company and had every lawyer at the highest hourly rate representing him if he was unable to crossexamine his accuser just as in crawford in crawford there was even an audiotape of what the wife said there was an audiotape there was a police officer who listened to what she said and this court found that wasnt good enough 
 well we didnt say in crawford i dont think we said in crawford i ought to know i suppose 
 that the new rule produced greater accuracy we said that it was the view of the framers of the constitution that crossexamination confrontation in that sense was necessary for greater accuracy now in our evaluation of what constitutes a landmark decision are we bound to the framers view of things i mean you know maybe im not sure that if you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of reliability under roberts im really not sure whether it wouldnt be more accurate than confrontation but that wouldnt matter to me because confrontation is what the constitution required and what the framers thought were necessary am i bound for purposes of the rule we are arguing about here to what the framers think 
 no your honor you are not bound to what the framers think however i think that you went far beyond simply saying that this was like quartering soldiers in discussing the confrontation clause and the right to confrontation the opinion goes into at length why the roberts rule was so fundamentally flawed you talked about the kinds of decisions that were produced although this court said that this court had pretty much tacked to the same direction as the framers view 
 i think that discussion of the you know the contrary decisions that had been produced under roberts was just for the purpose of justifying the overruling of a case that you know that was not that old it hadnt worked out as well as we maybe expected it would but i dont think it was for the purpose of showing that it always produces unreliable results 
 and i dont think that our burden would to be show that it always produces unreliable results i think that this court has clearly taken the position that the only constitutional reliability is the right to crossexamination however throughout your retroactivity jurisprudence you have been able to distinguish easily between issues such as the exclusionary rule the right to a crosssection of the community on a jury and the right to crossexamination i would point out to you the decisions that made bruton for instance retroactive because the right to crossexamination went so directly to the integrity of the factfinding process i think that one of the major difficulties in the argument being taken by the state 
 thats in an instruction like toomey versus ohio the judge is corrupt it is just structural you cant say that about crawford or can you 
 i dont mean to say your honor that it is structural i think the issue of whether something is structural error or harmless error has to do with whether or not it is measurable not whether its bedrock not whether its watershed not whether it leads to better accuracy we know that because in teague although gideon was the only case explicitly referenced there was also three other examples mentioned in teague there was a trial tainted by mob violence there was a trial flawed because of the intentional introduction of perjured testimony and there was a trial flawed by the introduction of testimony with regard to a coerced confession we know that two out of those three examples are actually subject to harmless error analysis so this court has never tied the issue of the elements of teague or even the elements of the preteague jurisprudence to the issue of whether something is structural or harmless it is the issue as it was in the more recent decision of gonzalezlopez of the right to choice of counsel decision they are what the court looked to to determine the issue was is it harmless is it quantifiable and in this case courts are accustomed appellate courts are accustomed to looking at the introduction of this kind of evidence and determining whether or not it is harmless the state has not taken a position before this court that the ninth circuit was erroneous in determining that this evidence was prejudicial and therefore affected the outcome so the issue of accuracy as defined by the state and by the government the problem with that argument and the easiest way to see the problem in that argument is if you look to gideon certainly we wouldnt argue that the insertion of counsel into a case may not result in what the state is defining as a more accurate result the insertion of counsel into a case may well cause the exclusion of evidence in fact in many instances that is exactly what counsel does so their definition of accuracy if applied to the gideon case would mean that gideon would flunk that definition and wouldnt be the case that has been so repeatedly referenced by this court as an example of the kind of case that should be made retroactive 
 ms forsman what about the cases we are had so far on this second teague category as far as i know well we havent found anything to be retroactive on collateral review so far so this would be the first time 
 it would be your honor and it is appropriate that this be the first time as i previously referenced those cases fell there are N of them by the way there were N decisions post teague applying the teague analysis in which this court did not find retroactivity the solicitor general is correct some of those were cases in which on collateral review the petitioner was seeking to actually create a new rule and apply it retroactively but if we look to cases such as the retroactivity application of batson for instance what this court has found is that the batson rule the crosssection of the community on a jury that the purpose of that rule was not created for the purpose of protecting against unjust convictions or ensuring the integrity of the factfinding process that was not the purpose of the batson rule this court found that it wasnt the purpose of the batson rule and that therefore it would not fall under the teague exception that is not so when you talk about the purpose of the crossexamination rule 
 what about the decision that said ring v arizona was not retroactive on collateral 
 again in schriro versus summerlin the issue there was an issue with regard to ultimate accuracy of a jury versus a judge again this court found that the evidence was the evidence was equivocal with regard to whether or not a judge findings or jury findings were more accurate now you might say well that sounds a little bit like roberts the problem with that is that it isnt like roberts because under roberts the crossexamination right which is something that we held so dear and connected so directly to the right to counsel having counsel without the right to crossexamination isnt much of a right 
 the problem with your case maybe its our problem because it was our rule is that we are asked to adopt an acrosstheboard calculus as to the rule in some cases as i think you will have to concede under the roberts jurisprudence the fact finding was more accurate in your case what you are telling us is that the fact finding is far less accurate but i think you are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we depart with it with a rulemade jurisprudence we have to look at the rule in the whole universe of cases not just your case it seems to me that was the problem you had in arguing in this area and maybe you can suggest some way out i dont see it 
 i can your honor the reason that i can is that the judge does not have the ability to see the crossexamination statement either so if we start with the premise when making this reliability determination we would have to throw out all of the statements in crawford and all of the previous cases which hold so dear the right to crossexamination and say but a judge can make a reliability determination without ever hearing the statements crossexamined can make them in that vacuum without ever testing the reliability of the statements with the with crossexamination and i dont know how you would be able to square that with the strong statements that are made in crawford and the strong statements that are made in the cases for instance in the case finding that bruton should be retroactive because it goes to the integrity of the fact finding process unlike all of the other cases that you have talked about since teague the integrity of the factfinding process is what is at issue here do you have confidence in a result which is based upon an accusers statements being admitted without ever having been crossexamined 
 but ohio versus roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability of these statements it was overruled because of a judgment that the founders wanted there to be crossexamination 
 thats your honor that is the base of the decision it harkens back to what the founders believed however the rule in roberts was described variously from amorphous to unpredictable proof manipulable to saying that the basis for the right to confrontation and crossexamination comes from a basic mistrust of even to the levels of a judge in terms of accepting the testimony without the advantage of an actual adversary proceeding this case of course illustrates the dire need for crossexamination because the accuser in this case testified inconsistently at the preliminary hearing in this case and then was excused before crossexamination was allowed the accuser in this case who was sent to a counselor by the district attorney when she went to the counselor refused to knowledge that the incident happened according to the testimony of the counselor and because the court and the record is very scant on what happened here the court the trial court for instance under roberts made only a couple of findings and he said the testimony was consistent he didnt look at the fact that it had been inconsistent on at least two other occasions and said it was chronological at least according to what the police officer said and so there were only a couple of findings by the trial court at all with respect to 
 you had the opportunity to challenge those findings under the roberts regime in state court 
 we did we did and that and that issue was not reached by the ninth circuit because after we had argued the case in the ninth circuit the crawford decision was decided and it was at that point that the ninth circuit picked up on the crawford and they didnt decide the issue of whether or not roberts would have meant that this testimony was unreliable anyway 
 you can still argue what hearsay exception did it come in under 
 it came in under a nevada statute which was patterned after roberts it came in under a nevada statute 
 adequate indicia of reliability 
 adequate indicia of reliability 
 yes adequate basically indicia of reliability it didnt go into it didnt go into too much more detail than that it just simply required that a witness under ten the court must find that the that the statement is reliable and the statements are reliable and then 
 is that universal in nevada i mean is they are no more hearsay rule in nevada that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in every case 
 no no that was a statute that was adopted specifically for child witnesses 
 this is for children under ten isnt it 
 children under ten 
 as you just said 
 thats correct 
 and here we had someone who was six years old and was hardly articulate it seems from the little we have of this record so the nevada statute i think was very specific to children and was not 
 it was yes yes no it was it was adopted for witnesses under ten this child actually was quite articulate in the preliminary hearing and was able was able to talk about the fact that she remembered talking to the police officer that she remembered but then but then in terms of trying to recall the incident she was unable to recall the incident and she was unable to recall it in any of the same detail that the police officer testified to so it wasnt you know it wasnt a circumstance in which you had a child who simply couldnt speak or a child who couldnt describe what had occurred 
 so if you lose this case you can go back to the ninth circuit and say well even under roberts it shouldnt have come in 
 i believe thats correct your honor because the ninth circuit did not reach that issue 
 would you comment ms forsman on your opponents argument based on N 
 yes i think the easiest way to explain our position on that is that what has been articulated here is that a retroactive a rule made retroactive by this court would be applicable to mr bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been somehow procedurally defaulted along the way in other words in order to be able to get the advantage that was discussed by both the state and the government of the other sections of the statute which clearly recognize as to the extent that its relevant the sponsor of the legislation did that you still have the power to make rules retroactive but the only way that mr bockting would be able to get advantage of that rule would be if the state court had never ruled on the merits of his claim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that meant that he was defaulted on the claim so instead of mr bockting who has raised this question of being able to crossexamine his accuser from day one in the trial he cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him if instead he now he goes back later and the court says no this is a successor petition you cant you cant get it you cant come into our courtroom the door is slammed on you according to the state now theres no ruling on the merits of his claim and thats why that section of the statute would permit the retroactive rule to apply N while it has the language clearly established and the court asked some questions about that i think it must be remembered that when that statute is being addressed its being addressed in state court or in federal court on federal habeas and so at the time that the petitioner is in federal court then the rule has been clearly established the N 
 thats not the state has to result the state its adjudicated on the merits in state court and results in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law 
 correct 
 so it seems to me that the question is what was the law what was the clearly established law at the time of the state decision 
 N i think the only way that you can read that section compatibly with the four other sections which are quoted in our appendix N of our brief the only way that you can do that is to recognize although this court will recall that it has described aedpa as not quite a silk purse of legislative drafting but the only way to make those sections compatible is to say listen what was going on when N was written was we were talking not about the timing of the new rule what we were talking about is who is it decided by because before aedpa was adopted it wasnt apparent that it must be a decision by you by this court that established by the rule so thats the first part and the second part is that its not dicta it is an actual holding of this court that is to be looked to to determine whether or not the state court was wrong and so the only way to read that is to say listen there has to be some meaning to retroactivity and what does retroactivity mean retroactivity means like a nunc pro tunc order that when you have determined that a new rule is retroactively applicable and certainly between aedpa and the teague exceptions which you did say in horn versus banks by the way should be analyzed differently although it has not been tossed up to you directly as it has in this case the meaning of the N you have repeatedly advised that teague is still alive and well and that when you look to the application of whether a rule should be applied retroactively you look to the teague exceptions so we also look 
 is there any language in N that could incorporate the teague exceptions 
 there is not language in N the language the reason that we know that congress was cognizant of teague is that there is language throughout aedpa particularly in the sections that we have quoted to you that are lifted directly from teague 
 what would we say if we were to say that N accommodates the teague exceptions that congress meant to put them in but just forgot to do it how would we account for the language 
 i think that what you would say is that congress would not have deprived you of the power to make a rule retroactively applicable and would have not then created the ludicrous situation which the state suggests would occur here which is instead of the motivation in congress in having someone like mr bockting raise the issue from the very beginning in one unitary proceeding as opposed to going back which is what they have suggested he must do in order to get the advantage of a retroactive rule is that congress was cognizant of that and in order to make all of the statute all of the provisions of the statute have meaning and not render certain provisions including the sections that we quoted superfluous that you must interpret that to mean that the that the that N is not a timing statute its what law do we look to that must be what they meant otherwise the rest of it just doesnt make any sense 
 isnt that making the tail wag the dog because theres language in the provisions on successive petitions that refers to teague that you would read the teague exceptions into N when theres nothing in the language there that can be interpreted to refer to them 
 no i dont believe thats the tail wagging the dog because i dont think that that was the intent of N i think the intent again i think the intent of N was in order to define what kinds of decisions the state court decisions should be measured against there must be some kind of meaning to retroactivity and retroactivity means that you are making this decision now and you are making it retroactive to the time it is not going to be many things as we know not only from your decisions but as we know from the very small core of decisions that teague left open and it is those decisions where we must worry whether or not an innocent man has been convicted it is those rules that protect against those an unjust an unwarranted a wrongful conviction it is only those rules that go to reliability that go to the integrity of the factfinding process that you are going to let through that veil so if it is only that small core of rules that you reserved in teague only that small core of rules and we know it wont be many at this point then if you read that compatibly with aedpa it is not and as we know it is not going to open the floodgates there is a very defined period of time in which people can bring actions for relief under your dodd decision decision there is only one year not from the time that you make if you were to make for instance this decision retroactive not from today but it is one year from crawford that petitioners have the opportunity to be able to come into court within that statute of limitations with regard to the date on which a new rule is adopted it is from that date forward so there is a defined population in appendix N of our brief you will see all of the decisions that we could find that have actually applied crawford and there were N of them and what you will find is that of the decisions and the state and the government have not disputed this of the N decisions which we were able to find at the time of the writing of that brief only five actually resulted in relief theres no question it would result in relief here because there is no contention before you that the ninth circuits determination of harmfulness there is no determination before you they havent challenged that to you so it would result in relief for mr bockting but because its harmless error or its not testimonial or there was a previous opportunity to crossexamine of the N decisions only N were found to have to result in relief and that is as it should be the state argues that watersheddedness if thats a word is that watersheddedness must mean that it affects many many decisions now that cant mean what teague means teague cant mean that my burden is to show you that many decisions will be overturned thats the exact opposite of what teague was decided for watersheddedness has to do with the alteration of our understanding it is difficult for me to understand how the change of course as described by then chief justice rehnquist that the change of course that crawford represented in the way that we look at the right to confrontation cannot be cannot be seen as precisely the alteration in the understanding of this bedrock principle again directly from the language of crawford we ask you your honors to make the rule of crawford retroactive and to affirm the determination of the ninth circuit 
 ms forsman can i ask you a personal question were you a moot court finalist 
 i was not 
 i attend a moot court at notre dame in about your year and it was an awfully good moot court 
 thank you your honor 
 thank you ms forsman general chanos you have two minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice i only have a few points first of all counsels argument with regard to the interpretation of N clearly established language is inconsistent with the statement made statements made by this court in lockyer and in williams v taylor in lockyer the court stated section N s clearly established phase referred to the holdings as opposed to the dicta of this courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state court decision citing williams v taylor in other words clearly established federal law under N is the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court renders its decision with regard to counsels point about this case in particular bockting i agree that there are broader issues beyond this particular fact situation however i want the court to feel comfortable that when this court sent this case back down to the nevada supreme court and told the nevada supreme court to follow ohio idaho versus wright the factors in idaho versus wright to determine trustworthiness talk about spontaneity and consistent reputation repetition mental state of declarant use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age and lack of motive to fabricate particularized guarantees of trustworthiness must be so trustworthy that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability following that admonishment from this court the nevada supreme court found those statements to be reliable and to satisfy the standards of ohio idaho versus wright finally i would just point out that although caldwell is indeed an important rule and may in fact be a fundamental rule so was batson in teague as was caldwell in sawyer as was ring in summerlin as was duncan in distefano as was mills in banks yet this court failed to apply retroactive status to any of those important fundamental rules saying none of them rose to the level of gideon versus wainwright the same should be true with your decision here with respect to crawford finally as justice harlan stated in the case of mckay talking about where this courts retroactivity jurisprudence has come from no one not 
 you can finish your sentence 
 thank you 
 particularly if it is justice harlan you are quoting 
 thank you mr chief justice no one not criminal defendants not the judicial system not society as a whole is benefitted by a judgment providing that a man shall tentatively go to jail today but tomorrow and every day thereafter his continued incarceration shall be subject to fresh litigation on issues already resolved thank you 
 thank you general the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in clark versus arizona mr goldberg 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court eric michael clark was denied his fourteenth amendment right to a fair trial arizona law defined the cognitive elements of firstdegree murder as requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that eric clark intentionally and knowingly shot and killed a police officer in the line of duty the state of arizona was permitted to offer facts to circumstantially prove these mental and essential requisite elements of mens rea under the rule espoused by the arizona supreme court in state versus mott as we have been calling it the mott rule this evidence as offered by the defense both in lay testimony and expert testimony was arbitrarily categorically excluded as a rule of evidence thats unsupported by any valid state purpose in this case 
 it was excluded with respect to mens rea but of course all of the evidence came in with respect to the insanity defense 
 it came in yes mr chief justice as to the insanity defense but could only be considered if eric knew right from wrong it cannot be considered because of the peculiar adoption of an amendment to N which is the arizona insanity statute that eliminated consideration of the nature and quality of his acts 
 is 
 well 
 the state telling us and we will ask the state when they argue but is the state telling us that it has defined intent in a particular way for this so that intent is just having the purpose to cause the result 
 if they were 
 and therefore that this testimony is irrelevant is that the states argument as you understand it 
 as i understand the states argument they are adopting what justice ginsburg wrote in montana v egelhoff that the state by enacting this rule has made this a substantive choice to make evidence of mental illness irrelevant however arizona did not do that and arizona did not argue that below below arizona argued repeatedly that eric clark knew this was a police officer that eric clark intentionally shot a police officer on appeal they argued the same thing in the appellate decision in this case by the court of appeals of the state of arizona the state i raised a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in addressing that issue and this is in the joint appendix at one if i could have one moment begins on page N of the joint appendix N and proceeds through the courts discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence in paragraph N the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could conclude and it states reasonable inference thereupon that clark knowingly and intentionally shot moritz and knew that he was a police officer when he did so theres repeated references that the arizona court of appeals did not understand that arizona had somehow by adoption of the mott rule decided to redefine the crime of firstdegree murder and as it we point in our opening brief they could not constitutionally do so 
 well what 
 well do you take that please 
 what do you make of the very name that the state gave not acquitted by reason not notguilty by reason of insanity but guilty except insane guilty of what guilty of the charge and the charge is firstdegree murder so even if insanity is found apparently thats defined to be guilty of the charge except insane therefore not subject to criminal punishment 
 thats correct justice ginsburg however guilty of the charge based on the states evidence without any consideration of the defendants evidence in this case 
 but 
 we offered N lay witnesses and their testimony in addition to the experts and i want to point this make this point clear the state wants you to believe that this issue only involves psychiatric expert testimony it does not and it involves lay fact evidence just as in any trial but these N lay witnesses talked about 
 but the lay im sorry that was my question the lay 
 these lay witnesses 
 witnesses still talked about his mental state correct 
 thats correct but the trial judge ruled under mott that he was precluded from considering all mental health evidence all evidence of mental disease or defect on the issue of mens rea so even though it was admitted and theres no quarrel here that all of the evidence that we sought to present was admitted it was not considered by the trial judge he could not because the mott rule itself is categorical and i quote from the mott decision as follows arizona does not allow evidence of a defendants mental disorder short of insanity either as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea elements of a crime that states all evidence and the trial judge understood it to mean that and thats the way it is applied in 
 no 
 arizona 
 what they have here the what the sg says which seemed right to me and i would like you to explain why it wasnt is that as far as the insanity defense is concerned that everyone in arizona agrees that you consider whether he knows right from wrong in respect to this act thus if he thinks the truckdriver is an alien or he thinks hes an animal and has a serious mental problem in knowing whats going on that comes right in as it did here because its relevant to whether he knew it was right or wrong to shoot this person and therefore once i read that i thought there is not at least in this case a question of whether the insanity defense is complete because it is everything that you wanted to introduce was introduced and indeed it was considered properly under the insanity defense and if you had convinced the jury you would or the i guess the jury you would have won on that now am i whats wrong with what i have just said 
 there is a distinction between nature and quality of ones acts and knowing whether an act is right or wrong and the states and the united states position here is not supported by the history of the development of mnaghten nor the ali version of the model penal code 
 yes but im interested in arizona remember im not what im interested in is whether if you say judge i am going to prove the following my client knows right from wrong in general but he thought that the truckdriver was a wild animal and that delusion meant that he is so insane he could not have formed the necessary intent the judge replies you can bring that in because if he thought the driver was a mental was a wild animal he did not know right from wrong in respect to this killing now is that what happened 
 no 
 in effect or would did the judge say you may not introduce that evidence because it is not relevant 
 no justice the trial judge ruled that we could offer the evidence because we were not before a jury and the judge was the trier of fact and he stated so that he would separate out for himself what he could consider and what he could not and his verdict in this case on the guilty except insane focused only on whether eric knew right from wrong 
 in this case 
 in this case 
 well fine so then what is would if he thought it was a wild animal then he would not have known right from wrong in respect to killing that individual 
 but that is not the states point or nor the united states governments point in this case 
 what is it 
 their point is that the former is subsumed in the latter in other words it makes no difference but the arizona court the arizona supreme court in a state court decision state versus chavez indicated otherwise 
 no but whether it 
 well i guess maybe the question is what is your point and i have the same question as justice breyer and id just like to pursue that if a case a hypothetical case is one in which the second prong of mnaghten knowing the difference in right and wrong gets to the question of his capacity to form an intent isnt that sufficient i think thats justice breyers question 
 it would if arizona allowed consideration of that evidence and it does not at all 
 but lets 
 now 
 yes but whether it does or 
 lets assume that it can consider the evidence as to on the rightandwrong prong 
 the rightandwrong prong 
 does the hypothetical state 
 in a hypothetical 
 that says we will let this evidence 
 in a hypothetical 
 in under the rightandwrong aspect of mnaghten but not under the nature and quality of the act 
 and your question is whether 
 why that isnt sufficient to answer your contention that his intent is not has not been subject to question 
 because first of all it is not offered and is not considered to specifically determine whether it rebuts an inference that the state has raised on factual point key to their case secondly the nature and quality is not a consideration in arizona 
 what they said 
 and even if it was and i would can point this out by an example that gets to what justice breyer was saying if a person is squeezing a lemon and this is a common example in law school and it turns out to be his sister he knows in the abstract that a person killing a person is right or wrong he knows its wrong but he does not know that squeezing a lemon is wrong in this case if eric clarks evidence showed that he believed the police officer was an alien and there was substantial evidence in the record to that effect and i would specifically point you to page N in the joint appendix where the where the expert testified that eric had a heightened fear of police 
 well i will look at mnaghten i had thought it was whether or not the action was right and wrong whether rather than the than the than the moral command was wrong 
 that is correct that is correct justice kennedy 
 then what do you do 
 then what you are saying if i understand it is that when the arizona statute refers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong the criminal act that they are referring to on your view is the act of intentional killing period and if thats what they mean then it is irrelevant that he thought he was killing a martian but if the arizona reference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the act in this case ie killing somebody you believe is a martian then the evidence could come in so i think your argument means your argument rests on the assumption that the arizona statutes reference to the criminal act being wrong means the criminal act in general in the abstract ie intentional killing as distinct from the act of killing somebody you believe to be a martian is that correct 
 absolutely thats not 
 okay 
 thats not 
 all right if thats 
 the end of it as well and the model penal code makes this point when they talk about their formulation which is a whether a defendant appreciates the wrongfulness of his conduct and they in their discussions had indicated and these are on pages N and N of the ali comments to the model penal code that mnaghten could under any formulation a person could in the abstract know that killing is wrong but could also in the in the their subjective mental state due to their mental disease not know that they were killing a human being 
 but the arizona court the court of appeals writes that it turns on the finding of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal offense it is difficult to imagine that a defendant who did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive that the act was wrong now those words written by the arizona court suggested to me that in the case of the lemon you are talking about or in the case of the individual who thinks that the truckdriver was a martian they would say he does not know right from wrong here now in this case that it seemed to me is what the court of appeals wrote 
 that 
 and if thats what they wrote then they dont adopt the test you are attacking rather they do let the very evidence that you want to come in come in and it is totally relevant 
 they would if it was not inconsistent with previous pronouncements of this very same court but although it is it is error to not instruct a jury on both prongs when arizona had both prongs it was harm deemed harmless error in state versus chavez but if 
 well but 
 but not 
 if justice breyer 
 but that it was error because they are distinct they are distinct elements and that is to suggest that a psychiatric psychosis is pervasive throughout an entire persons living 
 but if justice 
 but 
 breyers explanation is a correct statement of arizona law do you still have an argument that your proof should have been accepted on the first prong 
 yes 
 and what is that argument 
 the argument is that the state proved circumstantially his mental state the judge as the finder of fact never and stated so in his ruling on this issue could consider the lay testimony and the expert testimony on whether it raised a doubt a single reasonable doubt as to the states position and i can point this out on four facts first of all the state sought to prove intent and knowledge they did so by first arguing that erics conduct in driving around the neighborhood with the music playing loud was to lure a police officer this is in the record at on august N th in the opening statement by the states attorney page N on august N th at page N and thats in the joint appendix at N in their closing argument 
 and your evidence to the contrary that was excluded would have showed what 
 that it was equally plausible that he was driving around with his music playing loud because he was drowning out the voices in his head which were 
 so it went to diminished mental capacity and as i understand arizona law it has decided that that evidence can only be presented in the context of an insanity defense 
 and that is unconstitutional mr chief justice 
 you mean 
 first of all 
 the constitution 
 these are facts 
 requires a diminishedcapacity defense 
 no not the defense theres a very subtle but important distinction between the diminishedcapacity defense as an affirmative defense and diminishedcapacity evidence and its a shame that 
 well if you are going to let the evidence of diminished capacity in on mens rea you have done by as it were by the front door what you cant do by the back door ie by a diminishedcapacity defense because you are making the same point the burdens of proof are different but you are making the same point 
 well the burdens of proof goes to whether if we did not if we did not prevail or we did prevail on the second issue the whether mnaghten allows consideration of this whether it makes a difference in that situation the burden of proof is on us by clear and convincing 
 do you do you think it is unconstitutional for a state to say we know perfectly well that it is much more difficult for both cognitive and reason reasons and reasons of character and training and so on for some people to conform themselves to the criminal law than others we know its harder for some than others but we dont care how much harder it is unless it gets to the point that we define as insanity because unless we require something as serious as insanity to excuse everybodys going to have an excuse and there isnt going to be any criminal law is that unconstitutional 
 no its not 
 okay 
 but the 
 isnt that what the state does when it denies a diminishedcapacity says we will not have a diminishedcapacity defense 
 if it is framed as a defense yes but if 
 okay now 
 it is framed 
 isnt 
 as simply 
 no but isnt 
 lay evidence 
 with respect isnt that also what the state is getting at when it says we dont allow diminishedcapacity evidence in on mens rea which is the states burden rather we allow it in only on the defense of insanity so that we can keep it clear clear that unless the diminished capacity is so great as to amount to insanity its not an excuse and if that is what the state is doing is there any anything unconstitutional about that 
 the unconstitutionality of that of that procedure is that the states evidence goes uncontested the states evidence the states evidence and this has been fundamental to prove mens rea along with actus is a fundamental right of the defendant to present a defense to that and we are talking about presenting facts not having 
 well but it only 
 a psychiatrist get up there 
 goes uncontested 
 and 
 it only goes uncontested if the only way you are going to contest it is to show diminished capacity you could have contested this evidence by showing that you know he was a in a rock band and he wanted to play the music for to advertise the concert not to lure the police there are a lot of defenses you can present what they are saying is if it goes to diminished capacity that has to be used to show insanity or not or nothing at all 
 but their justifications for this rule mr chief justice are that its not reliable and it is reliable evidence both the lay testimony and expert testimony is admitted by the state for other purposes as well as for the defense in other purposes and has been found reliable and this is cited in footnote N of our reply brief 
 mr goldberg may i ask you to clarify one thing about your argument you say that you should have permitted been permitted to introduce this evidence to show that this act was not the act being kill a police officer was not done intentionally or knowingly but you seem to indicate that clark could have been convicted under the arizona code of some degree of murder am i right about that and if so what degree 
 absolutely your honor our position and i stated this in fact in my opening statement to the court as well as in our motion for a directed verdict after the close of the states evidence was that if the court found that the state had failed to prove considering all the evidence including the evidence of his mental illness that he did not know he was killing a police officer then he would be found guilty of seconddegree murder or manslaughter and that would be our position as to why this is unconstitutional in part because the state chose to define a specific crime as requiring that cognitive element that he knew he was killing a police officer and then 
 and what would 
 sought 
 what 
 to preclude any consideration of evidence that indicated the contrary 
 what was the second the definition of second degree 
 seconddegree murder is defined as intentional murder without premeditation thats one form of seconddegree murder in arizona now i want 
 well what 
 to get back to 
 may i just ask what if the proof youd like to introduce is that the defendant considered the police officer to be an alien why would he have any intent why wouldnt your argument go as well to second degree 
 because if he knew he was killing what he believed to be a alien who had taken over a human form then he may have known that he was killing somebody but not that it was a police officer because in his mind he believed that the police officer was an alien 
 but it doesnt go to premeditation i think thats justice ginsburgs point and i dont see why that isnt correct it doesnt got to premeditation 
 no justice scalia but he was not charged with a premeditated murder 
 no but you are saying you are saying he could have been charged with seconddegree murder 
 as intentional murder 
 because what 
 because the because the crime of seconddegree murder because this is a unique 
 does not require premeditation and i 
 right 
 dont see how this goes to premeditation anyway 
 does not go to premeditation goes to the question of whether he knowingly killed a police officer if you take seconddegree murder is includes all the elements of this particular first degreemurder statute and adds one and that one element is knowledge and intent to kill a police officer and thats the additional element that makes second degree a lesser included defense of first degree and the judge was precluded from considering the fact evidence in this case that indicated that eric was delusional that he was schizophrenic that he was actively delusional at the time of the crime and he believed that its our town had been inhabited by aliens 
 all right suppose he did he believed there its an alien which is not immoral to kill an alien lets say if he comes from mars i dont know about the morality of that but 
 i will go with you i will say that you are absolutely right about that now suppose in addition the judge did consider that he did consider it because he thought the person wouldnt know right from wrong if he thought this was an alien all right a space alien now suppose thats true then what is the problem from a dueprocess point of view after all you were able to make your claim there the judge would have heard the evidence and if the judge believed that that was so he would have acquitted the individual does there remain a dueprocess problem 
 not if it could be considered as to going to the element no but thats not this case 
 actually i was 
 it does not go to the mental state in this case because arizona law under state v mott precludes its consideration for that purpose 
 well suppose 
 for any purpose other than 
 i read state v 
 whether we made the 
 mott 
 other than whether we meet our burden of proving he is insane by clear and convincing evidence 
 is it your argument that it under arizona law it goes to excuse the conduct but not whether the conduct in fact occurred 
 it does 
 i mean is that your argument 
 thats the way the arizona 
 is that your argument 
 yes yes well thats the way the arizona rule is drafted it can go to if we can convince the trier of fact that it that his delusions prevent him from knowing the nature and quality of his acts if that was actually included in our statute but in our case we were limited to trying to prove his delusional behavior his delusional beliefs that the officer was an alien to show that he did not know right from wrong and that was it and that places the burden on us which runs counter to the fundamental principles of criminal law that are set down in winship that its the states burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element including this element and not without any opportunity of the defense to rebut that element 
 well thats a different question if in fact it came in via the insanity defense i guess the burden is on the defendant to prove it is 
 correct 
 that true well if it comes in via mens rea then the burden is on the state to disprove it 
 no the burdens not on the state to disprove it justice 
 doesnt the state have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt if it came in via mens rea that the mens rea was there 
 absolutely the burden never 
 and so the state 
 shifts from the state 
 would have to show that in fact he was not so insane as to preclude intent 
 in a technical sense yes but as a practical matter no because the state would be offering all of their evidence as they did here to show that circumstantially he had the intent we would be offering the evidence which is regularly accepted and is found reliable for numerous purposes in our state to show that theres a doubt as to whether he had that and thats a completely different thing than the state attempting having the burden on them to disprove it which this court has so said in affirmativedefense cases involving selfdefense for example that the state does not have to disprove that a person was justified or had a reasonable belief for their safety but that they and in the same token you cannot prevent the jury from considering whether that raises a doubt as to the states case and that is the fundamental problem the fundamental dueprocess violation here if there are no further questions id like to reserve the rest 
 thank you mr goldberg mr howe we will hear now from you 
 mr chief justice may it please the court the answer to both questions before this court today do states have the have the discretion to define it to define the affirmative defense of insanity as the policymakers see fit and they also have the right to protect that definition by as justice souters questions indicated from an from an attack on that definition by having evidence of diminished capacity of a different a different definition of insanity from coming in the back door 
 well to prevail do you think you have to show that under prong two of mnaghten the rightandwrong prong that the defendant can prove really everything and in fact did have the opportunity to prove everything that he seeks to prove under prong one if its do you have to convince us of that in order to win 
 i no your honor there are two answers to that the first answer is that the mnaghten definition of insanity the heart of it has always been the right or wrong test and this court in leland and i believe in powell as well have in have always referred to mnaghten as the right or wrong test state courts across the country they go 
 but its clear counsel though that the first prong of mnaghten adds something different you dont understand the nature and quality of your acts in other words it would be enough if you recognized both prongs if he thought this was a martian regardless of whether he knew it was wrong to kill a martian or not 
 yes thats correct your honor but as the lower courts spoke in mnaghten we dont look at the at the at the act in the abstract as the as the solicitor generals brief points out it says in here at page N that what the traditional mnaghten test looks at was his very conduct and as the arizona court of appeals noted it would be it would be difficult to imagine a situation where someone would know his conduct was wrong but not know the nature of his act and i wont pretend that perhaps in some theoretical hypothetical scenario that might you know that might occur but its very difficult indeed to imagine that and the arizona legislature rationally could you know could have you know decided that they will that they will reduce the definition to the heart of mnaghten which is right or wrong because the you know the issue of nature and quality will rarely if ever come up 
 but i am correct in assuming that it is and tell me if im wrong that it is your position the states position that under the right or wrong prongtwo part of mnaghten and under the evidence in this case the court was able to consider really all of the evidence thats necessary in order to meet this defendants defense as to as to intent 
 yes your honor and so 
 i agree with you im trying to think of some theoretical case where it would make a difference i cant quite come up with a hypothetical 
 and i have you know i have worked with this case for several months your honor and i havent come up with one either 
 well wouldnt it make a difference in a case in which an individual understands number one as a general matter that it is wrong to kill people intentionally he also believes that there are space aliens and he believes that it is wrong to kill space aliens but he kills one under the full mnaghten test under prong one he would have a defense but under the mnaghten test of prong two alone since he believed it was wrong to kill martians he wouldnt have a defense isnt that right 
 no your honor for two reasons the first reason is that the heart of the mnaghten test is knowing right from wrong and if a state in its in its discretion wants to say that those that the state will not account for those rare cases where it might make a difference a state could do that the second answer your honor is as mnaghten says at page N what we look at when we are examining whether the defendant knew right from wrong is his is the very conduct that he committed 
 counsel im puzzled about one thing i just maybe its just my stupidity but assume he thought it was a martian and assume he thought does he have to think it was wrong to kill martians or supposing he thinks it is not wrong to kill martians then what do you do does it matter whether he thinks its right or wrong to kill martians in other words 
 my point your honor is if he is not actually killing a space alien there is grave doubt that he would understand his conduct and that would make rather meaningless at some practical level asking the question did you know that your conduct was wrong 
 im not sure i understand the answer i that is it does he let me put it this way and maybe you can answer yes or no 
 sure 
 does he have to think its wrong to kill martians 
 no your honor what he what he has to understand is what he is actually doing and if he doesnt actually understand that he is killing a human being then its rather academic in abstract to ask did you know whether that did you know what you thought you were doing was wrong but at you know but again i suppose hypothetically there may be you know there may be a case where that would make a difference but the state is clearly free to recognize that thats an incredibly rare circumstance and that as a matter of policy we are not going to clutter up the definition of insanity with that it could you know adding that language a policymaker could very well decide that would be distracting to a jury or a factfinder 
 the thing that troubles me just to and then you can comment on it im assuming its possible they thought he didnt know whether it was a martian or not and that he thought he had a mission in life to kill martians that they are enemies they are bad to come and he wants to kill em if that was the what the trial court found could he be put to death for that killing 
 that would raise serious eighth amendment concerns your honor and 
 or could he just be found guilty of murder or whatever on those facts 
 if he truly believed that he was shooting an alien when he was actually shooting a human being he would he would certainly have you know a very strong case for insanity but what the factfinder found here was that but was that his was that his evidence that thats what he thought he was doing was 
 no but theres a 
 insufficient 
 difference in the burden of proof he has the burden of proof to get the affirmative defense or to get the in that category 
 surely 
 and im just wondering if hes just raises a doubt as so theres not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the person he was killing was either a human being or an a kind of individual that it would be wrong to kill 
 well 
 if theres just a reasonable doubt on the issue 
 well 
 would he be guilty or not 
 well your honor that raises the second issue that we are that we are discussing today that you know the state as i have argued has the right to define insanity as it as it sees fit and if you if you if a if a state allows evidence that doesnt rise to the standard of insanity to come in then you then hes able to raise whatever his personal definition of insanity is through the back door and the state has a great interest in preserving its definition of insanity and its ability to define insanity as it sees fit by as we argued 
 but as you say its in a way its in a sense it comes in through the back door as you say but even coming in through the back door if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent to kill a make a wrongful killing why shouldnt it be admissible 
 it should it isnt it isnt admissible your a state can preclude it your honor because the state has the definite right to define the element of mens rea and it is again as it sees fit and as 
 does that mean that it could also exclude the testimony from the lay people or the friends who talked about this persons illness 
 it 
 or are we just talking about the expert testimony 
 evidence of mental disease or defect whether its expert testimony or lay testimony does not come in under mott 
 mr howe would you explain to me how the state has proved intentional not intentional killing but of a police officer if thats the charge that he intended to kill a police officer how does the state meet its burden on a police officer if the testimony on the other side is i did not understand that this human that i killed was a police officer 
 what the what the state proved in this case your honor is that at least you know N weeks prior to the murder he indicated a desire to do to do something extremely similar to what he you know to what he actually did there was testimony he had he had an extreme dislike toward police officers on the at the time of the killing officer moritz was in was in a marked police car he had a uniform he turned on his lights and siren and clark you know 
 i see that on the 
 pulled over 
 the state side so the state has introduced evidence from which a trier could conclude he intended to kill a police officer but he wants to introduce on the other side i didnt have that intent in fact i had delusions i thought i killed an alien but hes not allowed to introduce that evidence 
 yes 
 to counter 
 your honor 
 the states proof as i understand what the arizona law is 
 sure what the arizona supreme court recognized in mott was what the arizona legislature did when it enacted its criminal code and it defined its mens rea it defined the mens rea in such a way you know just as you you know just as you explained in egelhoff your honor that the that the condition of mental disease or defect does not negate the mens rea so what the state has what the state has to prove in general and had to prove in this specific case is the state had to prove that clark either one actually had the had the intent to kill a police officer at least knowing he was a police officer or killed under or killed under circumstances that would indicate that he knowing at least knowingly killed a police officer but for his mental illness its 
 is this an alternative argument so that if we accept this argument we need not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two or is this complementary to the argument that the evidence comes in under prong two 
 i im not quite sure how to answer that your honor what we what we have argued the you know as far as the first issue is that a state is free to define insanity as it as it sees fit under most if not all cases or most if all real cases 
 why is that counsel lets suppose that the one of the cases that come up is a language difficulty the individual maybe hes not in uniform identifies himself as a police officer could the state have a rule that we are not going to allow evidence of language concerns that the individual didnt speak english and the officer said im a police officer so he didnt know when he shot him what is it about mental capacity that allows you to exclude that type of evidence 
 surely your honor this court has always noted that evidence of mental disease or defect is viewed quite skeptically because lawyers and psychiatrists and psychologists very often cant agree on the meaning or the value or the validity of psychiatric evidence the state also has an has an interest in preventing someone who has you know who theres at least a serious question of mental illness from being able to forgo an insanity defense but raise evidence to negate mens rea in the hopes that he would walk free instead of being found guilty except insane and sent to the state hospital theres also you know a third policy reason that because you in your because the you know because the gross question of whether someone is insane or sane is a difficult enough question with psychiatric evidence it raises it raises the question to a whole other level of complexity to ask the juries well if we if you find that he is sane but he has some degree of mental illness just find you know just how did that mental illness affect his ability to intend and the state as a matter of policy you know may properly say that is you know we are finding on the nature to determine whether someones insane or not but its just too complex a question to ask the a jury or a judge as in this case to make fine gradations of ability and responsibility 
 mr howe one of the things that puzzled me about your position is you said under arizona law while this doesnt come in under mens rea it does affect sentencing i think you said that the his mental state is properly taken into account in the sentencing and by that did you mean just the length of the incarceration or the place of the incarceration 
 your honor my time is up may 
 you can may answer 
 surely what under arizona law if you have a mental illness that does not rise to the level of insanity if the if the if the trial court or the jury finds that circumstance exists by a preponderance of the evidence and it can be found as a mitigating circumstance that he that can in a given case reduce the sentence imposed thank you very much 
 thank you mr howe general clement we will hear now from you 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court arizona has decided to adopt a particular form of the insanity defense and it has also decided to protect that substantive decision by channeling evidence about a defendants mental capacity into an affirmative defense with the burden squarely on the defendant neither aspect of that judgment violates the federal constitution and i think with respect to the substantive decision there are two elements to it first of all arizona wanted to streamline consideration of mnaghten and focus on the heart of mnaghten which is the right or wrong test but equally important as far back as N in the schantz case where they first came up with the rule applied in mott they also wanted to not have a diminishedcapacity defense in the state of arizona 
 could the state say that its the defendants burden to show that it was not a police officer 
 i dont think the state could the state do that is that the question 
 yes 
 i dont think the state 
 because the next question is why didnt they isnt that what happened here 
 right i dont think they could do that and i dont think thats what happened here and i think if you look at the evidence in this case i mean it came in in sort of a strange way in part i think because it was a bench trial but i think what the trial court did is say that all of the evidence on insanity all of the evidence in the second phase of the case is relevant its all coming in im going to take it into consideration but im going to take it into consideration only on the insanity defense not as part of the mens rea defense and i think that was consistent with arizona law what i think would be a harder question and let me just say i think the way that this was postured for the trial court was that the petitioner argued that all of that evidence comes in for consideration of the mens rea 
 it seems to me that you introduced the my concern by saying that they the state can put the burden of proof on the defendant which we know is generally true in many states with reference to the insanity defense but when you link it with mens rea then it seems to me you have a problem 
 well i dont think so justice kennedy but you are absolutely right to say that theres this tradition with insanity which is quite different than the tradition with respect to other elements of a crime and i think that goes back to the common law and goes back to blackstone and if you look at blackstone and you look at some of the common law cases that this court cited in its davis opinion they describe murder as having several elements one of them is obviously killing a person and one is malice aforethought and then some of the cases treat a sound mind as a separate element but i think if you look at the history its clear it wasnt a true element because the common law put the it started with a presumption of sanity which you couldnt have with respect to any other element and said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on the defendant and i think what the common law recognizes is the question of criminal responsibility or insanity although it has some logical relationship to mens rea can be separated out and can be dealt with in an affirmative defense and i think if you dont recognize the states ability to do that you end up allowing a defendant to basically sneak in through as justice souter put it the front door all sorts of watereddown insanity defenses in the guise of arguments trying to negate mens rea 
 it does seem as if the argument that oh this all comes in under second under the second prong means that if theres a theres another inference its a its a secondhand argument about lack of mens rea 
 well it i think justice kennedy though 
 kind of the secondclass 
 well 
 sort of evidence 
 i dont think its second class i think what arizona recognized in the schantz case and in mott in making this rule in the context of rejecting the diminishedcapacity defense is that if you allow a defendant to argue my evidence shows that i lack the capacity to form the requisite mental state and therefore that comes in on the mens rea case you can make that argument in terms of any insanity defense you like i can argue that i lack the capacity to form the requisite intent because i responded to an irresistible impulse well a state thats decided to have the mnaghten insanity defense rather than the irresistibleimpulse defense has to be able to make the judgment i submit that we are going to have the mnaghten defense and we are going to keep it as an affirmative defense and we are not going to allow that defense that we have rejected to effectively come in through the front door and to use justice souters 
 that would present a serious constitutional question wouldnt it or what i mean i thats but i thought some of these questions might be in this case but i now doubt im having doubts about that but suppose the state so limits the defense that an individual defendant who by any ordinary psychiatric test would be viewed as seriously insane and therefore not a person who is capable of being held responsible in any moral sense for the crime is nonetheless going to be convicted of murder i mean and that might be come up with irresistible impulse because the person is totally insane not like any other human being anyone would normally say he lacked the knowledge of hes not responsible for what he does and then the state nonetheless convicts him of murder 
 but justice breyer they wouldnt convict him for murder because he would qualify for an insanity defense and somebody as insane as you are 
 if he knew right from wrong if they so i mean he its not his intellectual capacity thats wrong its his ability to control his impulse 
 well i mean 
 but thats not in this case i agree with you 
 but 
 but is a variation of that in this case namely the variation but we have discussed that at length and i take it you think thats not in this case 
 i dont think its in this case but i dont want to mislead you which is as i think you can hypothesize a situation where somebody would be exonerated by one form of the insanity defense and not exonerated by a narrow form of the insanity defense and i dont think it follows that somebody thats in that margin has a constitutional right to make up the difference effectively through a mens rea argument and otherwise i think you i mean you 
 but we dont have to reach that question here in your view 
 well i think you 
 or do we 
 i would think that you might i mean i think you could say because i think what happened here is all of this evidence came in on the back door through the insanity defense 
 but if we have to reach it this they are arguing we do because they are saying the person is so insane he doesnt know whether this is a human being or a sack of lemons now 
 but then he 
 he said that they didnt consider that in the insanity defense and hes not attacking the burden of proof at least not in this court and so i do you think we do have to that we have to 
 i 
 assume that hes right on that 
 i dont think you have to reach that question here but you do have to reach a related question i think which is i think the trial court here very clearly in applying mott prevented the petitioner from making a diminishedcapacity argument and then 
 what is diminished capacity if it is what is that 
 its an argument that is basically a variation on the insanity defense its partial responsibility it was basically the governing law in california until it was 
 but partial responsibility does not insanity they use the words insanity and diminished responsibility i took the word insanity to mean the kind of mental state that would in fact show a lack of intent i took the word diminished responsibility to mean there is intent but its excusable 
 i think you can draw that 
 now am i 
 distinction but i do want to make clear that there are arguments here that you could make in a different state that you cant make in arizona because of the substantive decision that we dont want to have a diminishedcapacity defense and we dont want to have that policy judgment frustrated by having the evidence come in through the front door and to use justice 
 may i ask 
 souters example 
 this question supposing the evidence is equally divided on the question of whether he thought it was a martian who he had a right to kill could he be convicted of murder constitutionally 
 i think he could justice stevens as i understand 
 because then 
 the hypothetical we are 
 there would be 
 basically 
 not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he was killing a human being and it was wrong to do so 
 well i think it would it might depend on exactly what the statutory definition of murder in the state was 
 well i dont i dont im just wondering as a constitutional matter forgetting all the as a constitutional matter can a man be convicted of murder if the evidence is equally balanced on the question of whether he knew it he did anything wrong and or knew that he was killing a human being 
 maybe not justice stevens it just depends on the way that the statute deals with it because in my view of the statute if somebody really thought if they had to kill a human being and they thought i wasnt doing it i was killing an alien maybe that could come in on mens rea but if 
 have we ever held that an insanity defense is required that a state cannot simply abolish insanity defenses 
 no justice scalia you have not held 
 i didnt we had 
 that and i think but equally i dont think a state would is required to have a diminishedcapacity defense and 
 well is a state required to adopt any particular mens rea for murder is there a constitutional requirement as to the minimum mens rea that can be can be set for the offense of murder 
 i dont think so i mean i think its very difficult to find in the due process clause the tools necessary to superintend those kind 
 but here there 
 of decisions 
 was a charge intended to kill a police officer it could have been just intended to kill and i think mr goldberg conceded that intended to kill would have been a proper conviction but not intended to kill a police officer 
 well 
 unless hes allowed to counter that addon 
 with respect justice ginsburg i think that starts to confuse the hypotheticals with the real case because i dont think petitioners argument was that they had no idea that this person was a police officer and he thought he was killing an alien i think their argument was much more one for insanity and that maybe there were other explanations for the conduct but the psychological testimony here suggests that maybe he sometimes thought that his mother was also an alien but he kind of knew it was his mother as well and so i dont really think that maps up with the argument they have made the one point i want to leave you with though is as justice souter said everybody agrees that theres no dueprocess requirement that arizona have a diminishedcapacity defense well it doesnt make any sense to say that they have to have that implicitly with the burden on the state at the same time thank you 
 thank you general mr goldberg you have N minutes remaining 
 there is a dueprocess guarantee that the defendant can present evidence in his own defense no matter how the chambers line of cases is viewed by the court this court made clear in montana v egelhoff that in the absence of any valid state justification and im quoting now from the plurality decision exclusion of exculpatory evidence deprives the defendant its very basic to have the prosecutors case encounter and survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing and that 
 but that certainly doesnt include the right to present any evidence you want 
 its the difference between 
 you couldnt have presented evidence that this person was in fact a martian 
 thats correct mr chief justice and its not that we are asking to this court to affirmatively rule that all of this evidence comes in just that all of it cannot be excluded per se and that the trial judge is just as in any other type of evidence any other fact or opinion evidence serves as the gatekeeper under the rules of evidence to decide whether its more prejudicial or its more probative but arizona has decided only for this purpose that this evidence is inherently unreliable and then they have taken it to the point where they have proven somebody guilty of murder in the first degree of killing a police officer without allowing him to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was killing a police officer and that specific argument was made contrary to what the solicitor just stated in my motion for directed verdict that i made in this case 
 was it a reasonable question whether he knew it was a police officer or whether he knew it was a human being 
 whether it was a police officer i moved the court for a directed verdict at the close of the states evidence and argued to the court that if he found the judge as the factfinder that in his delusional mind and again reurged this at the close of our evidence that he believed he was killing a police officer then the court could find him guilty of seconddegree murder or manslaughter and i asked the court to do that and the court refused to do that so the 
 in the 
 court precluded any consideration of this evidence 
 yes i the best i can find in that court of appeals opinion at the moment is that they do reject the idea of diminished responsibility on mott on the ground of mott thats true they say dont even consider it but i didnt think diminished responsibility went to the question of whether he had the requisite intent i thought insanity went to that as they use those words what is diminished responsibility if it isnt we admit the intent we admit that he intended to kill the individual knew it was wrong but he isnt as responsible as an ordinary person would be what is 
 its not 
 it if it isnt that 
 its a fact that a fact that he did not know he was killing a police officer 
 he thought he was killing another individual 
 correct 
 does that 
 or an alien 
 does the state have to does the constitution have to let you off if thats the situation 
 its not let you off with all due respect its judge somebody based on 
 yes you 
 their personal 
 all right but 
 culpability 
 but does the state have to say we are going to convict you of a lesser offense in the constitution 
 the state the state has to allow the defendant to present his evidence and have it considered if its relevant nonprivileged and reliable for a proper purpose and here it was offered for a proper purpose just as in chambers and in rock and in all the cases that have been before this court where this court has held so i wanted to add answer one question that was raised earlier about whether a state could define murder without a requisite mens rea essentially which is or a specific intent as the state seems to suggest that arizona has done inferentially under the mott decision this court held in N in davis versus united states that no one and im quoting here no one we assume would wish either the courts or juries when trying a case of murder to disregard the main principle existing at common law and recognized in all cases tending to support the charge below to make a complete crime cognizable by human laws which includes mens rea and an actus rea 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in zedner v united states mr zas 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the speedy trial act protects the public as well as the personal interests of defendants by mandating the prompt disposition of federal criminal prosecutions in this case the government and the district court failed to comply with the clear requirements of the act as relevant here the act provides that the trial of a defendant who pleads not guilty and who is released on bail shall commence within N days after the indictment the act however is not as inflexible as it sounds the act permits numerous categories of delay to be excluded from the N day limit the act also provides an enforcement mechanism if more than N nonexcludable days elapse between the indictment and the trial the indictment shall be dismissed this case concerns two periods of delay that each exceed the N day time limit and id like to focus initially on the longer period of delay this is the delay that took place between N and N after a competency proceeding was taken under advisement just to put this delay in context a competency hearing was held on july N N the judge solicited posthearing briefs the matter was taken under advisement on august N rd and in our papers we asked the judge to find petitioner competent and to set the matter for trial as soon as possible we noted that at that point the case was already more than N years old we offered to waive a jury and proceed to a bench trial immediately and at that point the case sat idle for the next N days now the act excludes only the first N days of that period thats section N for reasons that have never been explained the court sat on the proceeding when N months went by we filed a motion 
 what about mr zas that the court thought it was home free on the speedy trial act after all it had gotten a waiver for all time isnt that why the N days 
 that may be justice ginsburg but but as of our filing after the competency proceeding we asked for a trial as soon as possible so putting aside whether the waiver had any validity at all which i will get to shortly the waiver had no effect when we came in and asked for a trial otherwise defendants would have no right to a speedy trial and 
 yes but on on that one the the second circuit said that he was incompetent and you could have excluded the time on because allows you to exclude time when hes incompetent and if in fact the district judge is sitting there thinking hes incompetent then the failure is simply a failure to write down his reason why its excluded i guess theres uncertainty here as to what reason was the district judge excluded that time and its a little bit hypothetical for the reason that justice ginsburg mentioned but if you were to lose on the first point then i guess on this point the thing to do would be to send it back and determine whether in fact the judge intended to exclude on the ground of competency in which case his failure was simply a failure to note down his reason which is not required by the act 
 well justice breyer i have several responses for that the court only made a finding that mr zedner was incompetent on march N N prior to that time the competency issue was under advisement it couldnt be that mr zedners incompetency if it existed before the finding is what prevented the court from declaring him incompetent 
 you are not quite through your answer yet but is there also a requirement that the competency determination be made within N days or am i am i in error on that point 
 your honor is is exactly right any proceeding under section N is excluded but only for N days once its taken under advisement 
 im sorry my act must read differently my act says in any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent it doesnt say anything about N days 
 but that but thats different i take it from the judges delay in making the finding of competency 
 thats right your honor yes on justice breyer on your reading a a court could sit indefinitely with the competency proceeding under advisement 
 yes thats why see i guess on this point wed have to send it back because if in fact the judge had determined in his mind within the N day period that the person was incompetent or he was incompetent in fact then that could have been his reason im not sure what to do about this point in any case and i understand that you think he wasnt incompetent or at least it hadnt been so found the second circuit seemed to think he was incompetent because that was their basis so i guess if he was its excluded and if he wasnt it isnt excluded and i dont know the second circuit said he was so maybe you should have another chance to argue this before the second circuit 
 your honor im im just trying to envision what that remand would look like if the court were if the if the case were to go back to the second circuit and then go back to the district court for a finding that this delay resulted from mr zedners incompetency that finding would be clearly erroneous there is no there is no basis 
 the delay the delay was not because we cant try this man because hes incompetent and until hes rendered competent we we have to stay proceedings that wasnt the basis at all it was just i havent made up my mind yet 
 thats right your honor and the act 
 which is what is specifically precluded by the requirement that that you act within N days and and all the rest of the time the clock is running 
 thats correct your honor 
 and i take it the trial the speedy trial act doesnt say if the judge is thinking about something it requires him to make an order 
 no your honor it it says that the court has decide the matter within N days or the clock will start running now the court in a particularly difficult or novel question could could enter an order of ends of justice exclusion and exclude perhaps an additional period of time 
 well i was going to ask you about that or could he vacate submission because he wants new evidence or something could you vacate submission of the of the first competency hearing in order to take new evidence 
 absolutely your honor and that matter would would be back to a a situation in which theres examinations or hearings or argument or posthearing brief and and the judge can take as long as the judge wants there but once the court has the matter under advisement the court only has N days 
 so your view is that we should say that the second circuits statement that the defendant could not have been tried because at that time he was incompetent that we should simply say thats false that the second circuit is wrong to say that 
 well not quite your honor the question the question is did more than N nonexcludable days elapse during this period or not once the finding was made in march thats when mr zedner was incompetent no further findings was necessary were necessary and the time is then automatically excluded the time prior counts toward the N day period whether or not he was in some metaphysical sense incompetent before then the question is not whether he could have been tried or not in that period the question is did more than N days elapse and if the judge had decided this matter sooner mr zedner would have been received the treatment he ultimately got much sooner and the trial would have occurred much sooner thats the purpose of the speedy trial act now the government has abandoned the second circuits holding to the effect that harmless error analysis applies to a violation of the N day limit thats a wise position for the government take to take given this courts holding in bozeman which interpreted essentially the same language the court there held that where the statute says the indictment shall be dismissed theres no room for harmless error analysis thats the remedy that congress chose so in this case on the on the this period of delay we are talking about more than N days elapsed and the remedy must be dismissal 
 now we have been talking about the competency period i take it the first period was one of just repeated requests for extensions thats january N until may N 
 thats correct 
 and thats this thats the first of the two periods thats involved here 
 thats correct this was this was a an adjournment that was requested by mr zedners first lawyer for the stated purpose of investigating whether the onited states bond supposedly issued by the ministry of finance of usa was genuine the court having already obtained a purported waiver of a speedy trial for all time granted the continuance but made no order of excludable delay as it had done previously made no 
 i dont know if it makes any difference to the case do you do you think the court could have made findings that would have been justified i mean it takes a while to find an expert to say that a bond is genuine when it spells united with o but 
 it could take for all time your honor i think it would be a very close question as to whether that could survive appellate review that may well be an abuse of discretion to find after having let the matter delayed the matter already N months to grant another N months for that purpose 
 are there are there cases in which the judges findings lets assume that he made the findings are set aside for abuse of discretion on on review for a violation of the speedy trial act 
 that is the standard that the courts of appeals have generally applied i cant recall a case where the court actually reversed an ends of justice finding there may well be one based on a legal error where it was some obvious ground that that is not a basis for an adjournment such as 
 who who could complain because in in all of these instances it was the defendant who sought the enlarged time in fact even though the judge had given gotten this allpurpose waiver he didnt give defense counsel as much time as defense counsel asked for to to investigate the genuineness of the bond 
 well justice ginsburg you are right certainly the petitioner and his counsel at the time requested this adjournment they did get the full adjournment they requested but the judge said that that would be the last adjournment and that the matter would be set for trial then but whether that time is excludable or not is answered by the statute the ends of justice provision recognizes that defendants or prosecutors and judges on their own motion would seek or grant continuances but thats not enough under the statute the statute is although its flexible is rigorous the court must make a finding that the ends of justice outweigh the publics and the defendants interest in a speedy trial 
 and you think its its not harmless error if they didnt make the finding but but could have 
 thats right your honor its not harmless for the same reason the later period is not harmless because the statute says that if the defendant is not brought to trial within the time limits the indictment shall be dismissed and it makes very clear that in the absence of an ends of justice finding the time is not excludable 
 no but isnt isnt the difference that in the latter period the court took no action and there is a mandate on the court to act with respect to this earlier period the court did act incidentally it did exactly what the defendant wanted it to do but it acted so that the only the only reason for arguing error here is in effect a clerical reason he didnt say the magic words or make the magic conclusion if in fact thats because he couldnt have made it no question you you got a violation of the statute but if he could have made it and and simply didnt say the magic words you are in a very different position here from what you are in in the case of of the failure to act on the on the competency issue 
 justice souter i would i would not characterize this as a clerical error congress considered this provision the heart of of a scheme this was where 
 well lets put it this way its a failure to speak rather than a failure to act in in the latter case no action in this case action in fact action as more its as requested but a failure to speak contemporaneously with the action thats different 
 well i would disagree again with the characterization that its just a failure to speak the act requires a careful weighing of the publics interest the ends of justice the defendants interest so its not just a matter of speaking this is 
 well we dont we dont know i mean on the face of the record we dont know whether he weighed or whether he didnt weigh in the second case we know that he didnt act and and action is what hes got to to accomplish but whether he weighed or not we dont know he just didnt say whether he weighed 
 thats right and the court also didnt make the finding 
 right 
 or state the reasons that the statute specifically requires and the question for the court is what flows from that failure and the answer is given in the sanctions provision it says that if more than N nonexcluded days elapse the indictment shall be dismissed now that provision itself builds in flexibility to take into account exactly what your honor is talking about a judge may dismiss without prejudice to reprosecution depending on various factors including whether it was just an oversight a failure to recite words so thats where 
 no i i 
 thats where this this distinction that you are drawing can be taken into account 
 but its it requires in order for us to conclude that thats the only way it can be taken account into account we wed have to conclude that that rule N was in effect partially repealed and made inapplicable implicitly here without any reference to it and thats that kind of lets say implicit modification of of one of the rules is as a matter of normal interpretation disfavored 
 well your honor i think that the principle wellaccepted principle that the more specific provision will govern over the general governs here so the remedy provision the sanctions provision here says that the indictment shall be dismissed whether its N days that elapsed or N days or N years 
 but theres always some sanction for error and the point of the harmless error rule is to determine whether that specific sanction should be applied 
 yes but theres not always a an express command from congress as to what the remedy should be once congress says the indictment shall be dismissed theres no room for a court to say that the indictment shall not be dismissed unless theres some harm shown so this specific provision trumps the more general provisions of rule N 
 id like to know how how do we know that the judge didnt set forth orally his reasons for finding that the ends of justice outweigh the interest et cetera is that in the record what he actually said 
 well you only 
 because i dont know that youd have to use the exact words the ends of justice served you know you dont have to id like to read what he actually said and where where is that its not on page N which is somebodys opinion but rather if i want to read the words where do i look 
 your honor this the only place you will find the words here are the transcript of the status conference on january N N thats the joint appendix beginning at page N and you will not find a finding regarding the ends of justice you will not find mention of the the public interest or any of the other balancing factors in the act 
 he didnt think he needed it he had a perpetual waiver 
 thats correct this judge stopped complying with the act on november N th N because the court ruled that the waiver for all time was valid that was a an injudicious finding to say the least N minutes worth of legal research would have shown that all the courts of appeals at the time had already held that the waivers were invalid so the court didnt do a balancing didnt think it was doing a balancing the court has a colloquy in which it appropriately expressed skepticism about the need for this delay and the court does in effect what congress was concerned about it indulged defense counsel and said well if you dont care enough i dont care enough take N more months thats basically what happened 
 mr zas are you going to talk about estoppel 
 yes your honor the the government for the first time here in this court has unveiled a new doctrine that hadnt been in the case before its no longer relying on either the waiver for all time or the sort of miniwaiver for the the january delay but it argues that petitioner is estopped from challenging the N day delay in N there are several problems with the governments argument but the most obvious one is that the only conduct that the government cites to trigger the estoppel is the waiver 
 well isnt there something more than a waiver here i mean waiver is a very broad term i mean it would cover a situation for example in which the government asked for time and the defendant said okay i waive in in this case theres theres an affirmative act on the part of the defendant hes not merely waiving he is affirmatively asking for action on the part of the court and subject i guess to cutting down the period somewhat he got what he asked for this is something more than waiver this is in fact a a grant of specific relief requested by him and he now wants to turn the tables based on receiving exactly what he asked for thats more than waiver 
 well your honor i cant disagree with what you have said but but the 
 well i can did he ask for a perpetual waiver i thought the way the colloquy went the judge said no you know i cant give you a waiver unless you will unless you will make it a perpetual waiver and then he said okay i will make it a perpetual waiver wasnt wasnt the the initiative for the perpetual waiver from from the court 
 thats right your honor 
 and hasnt my brother cleverly changed my hypothetical because i was 
 i was not talking about the perpetual waiver i was talking about the waiver for whatever number of days he actually took in in that case which was what N days 
 yes 
 yes 
 i think i think there are two different waivers that 
 okay 
 that are before the court so justice souter your question is about not the waiver for all time but the more limited action in requesting and obtaining the continuance now ordinarily without a statute like this the defendant getting what he wants would amount to a waiver and the defendant could complain for example an evidentiary ruling if if the defendant wants to allow he doesnt object to evidence coming in thats it he cant later argue that it should not have come in the problem here is that the statute the congress knew that this kind of thing would happen defendants would want delay defendants would be quite happy to put off their trial for as long as they could 
 as long as they are not in jail pending trial 
 thats right thats right if they are out in the community congress wanted those people to be tried and so the ends of justice provision specifically says that a request for a continuance granted by the court is not enough to exclude time there has to be both a finding and a statement of reasons in the record to support the finding before the time will be excluded justice breyer 
 maybe you could say then that its the government that has the right if its the government that has the right then government should have objected i mean the problem of course is obvious that its a little hard on the district judges that people come in and both sides tell them what you have to have here is a waiver are you sure you wont raise this against me later im positive i swear you mean you absolutely swear a thousand times that no matter what i do and have delay you will never raise this as an error and its fine yes okay so he says okay fine done you win then he raises it as an error thats rather called sandbagging the judge and obviously one would look to or i would look to ways to avoid that but you are telling me i cant avoid it and thats what congress wanted and so be it is that right 
 well its its partially correct your honor 
 how is it not correct thats what im 
 well its not correct because i would i would disagree with the characterization if thats what your honor is doing of of anything that happened here as being sandbagging 
 im not talking about here im saying that in your if i adopt your position in this case i would have to have the same position i would think in the most egregious cases wouldnt i because the only reason id adopt it here is because congress wanted it no matter what 
 yes 
 is that right 
 yes that that is 
 okay then you are then am i right in characterizing 
 well that that is what the that is what the statute says but your honor shouldnt shouldnt tarry too long about the consequences because if this court holds as we ask the court to hold that waivers are no good waivers have to be treated essentially as a request for a continuance this problem goes away 
 maybe i mean judges are very busy not all the prosecutors get the word its very hard to ask district judges to raise something on their own in the face of lawyers who are telling them the opposite so you say oh they will all know i have noticed there are a lot of opinions we write that they dont know about 
 until say the lawyers point them out 
 well your honor the alternative if you go sort of the governments route here is to essentially perpetuate the confusion that brought us here in the first place the government essentially argues well you cant waive but sometimes you can waive we are not quite we are not going to tell you exactly when you can waive thats going to put district judges in a in a worse position in a more confused position 
 this this was a judge who apparently was doing this as a a matter of standard practice he had a form that he whipped out it must be a very old form it looked like it was typed on a regular typewriter 
 that thats right your honor this form was was preprinted or pretyped 
 and gothic print right 
 it could have come from my chambers 
 and as we point out in the reply brief the judge had taken a strong legal position N years earlier that the requirements of the act could be waived 
 i was going to ask what is the date of the speedy trial act N 
 i think president ford signed it on january N rd N 
 and it was widely publicized among the judiciary then 
 yes yes yes and you know this is not a new statute judges are used to to complying with it prosecutors are used to doing it frankly i have never seen a waiver for all time before its not the kind of thing that will happen and it should never happen again 
 can you make an ends of justice finding for all time could he start at the beginning any continuance i grant is granted after my weighing the different factors set forth in the statute and its in the ends of justice 
 i dont think so your honor in fact there there is a circuit split on on whether you can whether a court can grant an openended continuance i think your your honors ends of justice continuance would amount to a waiver or a suspension of the act thank you very much 
 thank you counsel mr joseffer 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court on the first of the time periods it might help if i could start by laying out three basic principles the first is that a defendant may not opt out of the act by waiver the second is that a a defendant is nonetheless precluded from challenging the grant of a continuance that he requested if the continuance satisfies the substantive ends of justice standards of the act and the defendants waiver or other litigation conduct induced the court to commit the procedural error of not recording an ends of justice finding in the record and the third related point although its not presented here is that the courts of appeals have recognized that if a defendant requests an ends of justice continuance and the court in a procedurally regular manner grants the ends of justice continuance the defendant cannot later be heard to contend that there was the ends of justice were not really satisfied even though he had told the court that they were we think the reasons for those three rules stems from the reason that defendants cannot opt out of the act in the first place although the act does not contain an express antiwaiver or antiestoppel provision it does manifest an intent to bind defendants to its requirements in order to protect the public interest in a speedy trial if a defendant could opt out of the act altogether and thereby obtain delays that are not authorized by the act that would thwart the public interest in a speedy trial 
 but but as we have indicated the the judge was the one that opted out of the act by this regular practice of requiring the perpetual waiver or whatever we call it 
 i guess there there are couple things there one is that we are not we we are not here relying on the waiver for all time our point instead here is that when defendant requested the continuance at issue here it was the defendant that said your honor i i need a continuance and i waive my rights so you should give me the continuance and then also said he needed additional preparation time the court then and this this is at ja from about page N to N the court then said well why do you need the time and the court discussed with him for a while why he really needed additional preparation time reminded counsel that notwithstanding the waiver this was a criminal case and criminal cases do need to be tried and ended up balancing the defendants desire for preparation against the need for a speedy trial by granting a much shorter continuance than requested and that is actually an entirely appropriate ends of justice balancing ends of justice reasoning 
 its pretty hard to read those pages as if they were anything other than what they seemed to be on their face that he didnt worry about the speedy trial act because he thought that it had been waived 
 i think you are absolutely right that the court was not at that point thinking in terms of applying the speedy trial act 
 well then why isnt that the end of that that the if you agree that the defendant cant waive it well the reason that he got the continuance is because he waived it otherwise there would have been something else done and or at least might have been 
 right no our i mean we think there are two related points one is that a genuine optout of the waiver and a general optout of the act an attempt to obtain time thats not excludable under the act is not permissible because that would thwart the public interest in a speedy trial but where the error is a purely procedural one a failing to record findings in the record regarding a continuance that is permitted under the substantive standards of the act then holding the defendant to the waiver under a theory of either waiver or estoppel in our view doesnt matter which 
 how can we say its purely procedural with respect to the first time i mean the reason that was given is i have to i need this time to find out if these really peculiar looking bonds are genuine now the the second circuit said and i dont understand why they said this this is a complex case so that continuance is warranted was this a complex case 
 complex defendants can make for complex cases 
 and this is i think the ultimate example of that but in addition its important to remember that at the end of this N day period that was granted defense counsel withdrew on the ground that his client was still insisting that he present the frivolous defense that that the bonds were genuine and before withdrawing and telling the court that the the defense counsel had a very serious duty to his client and the court to continue to investigate what his client was saying was the defense and to continue to try to work with his client and try to come up with a plausible defense strategy now it didnt work and counsel had to withdraw but i dont think he can be faulted for trying 
 did the government at any point tell the tell the court your honor we think the act requires you to make a specific finding and we request you do that 
 no the government i mean on the one hand the government did not seek these delays did not encourage the waiver did not rely on the waiver at the at the relevant times however at the time i mean 
 because i mean you are you are coming in and saying oh well he waived but certainly the government could could have asked the asked the district court to make the necessary findings 
 right and at the time of of this this was about N years ago now the second circuit recently held that waiver is not ordinarily appropriate but sometimes is and so everyone in the bar i mean has been acting under some some confusion we think that that frankly to some extent persists to this day we think that the best way to clarify matters going forward is is a combination of the two things i mentioned earlier to say first defendants cannot opt out of the act by waiver to just try to discourage waivers but to say that mistakes will happen and that when a a continuance when a court grants a specific continuance that is authorized under the substantive standards of the act that at that point in time the defendants waiver or other conduct that induces a court not to make the findings prevents the defendant from trying to seize on a purely procedural violation on appeal because at that point remember the the reason for for a a partial antiwaiver rule here is not that theres a specific antiwaiver or antiestoppel provision in the act its that congress has on the whole manifested an intent to protect the public interest in a speedy trial but if the time is excludable under the substantive standards of the act a purely procedural error does not diminish the publics interest in a speedy trial because the 
 what what are you hypothesizing that the court actually made this finding in its mind but just didnt express it or are you hypothesizing that the court could have made it but didnt make it never even went through the mental process 
 we think that legally speaking all that matters is that the court could have and that once 
 could have made it so so we are going to why cant life be simple we are going to have to have trials all the time as to whether in this hypothetical situation this finding could have been made i mean you know this creates subsidiary litigation that we really dont need 
 in in some instances it may add to an additional degree of complexity although i will say that whatever that might be its still less than the complexity of retrying the case and also i think more often than not on the face of the record i mean these these determinations can be made here for example i mean if if a court grants a continuance for any reason its going to ask the reasons why here the court questioned counsel as to whether he really needed more time explained his basic reasoning for doing so and so when when its apparent on the record that a continuance could have been granted thats certainly a much less complex inquiry than trying the case 
 suppose you ask the judge you say judge N months ago the defendant came to you and said i waive the speedy trial act now the defendant says judge i now would like a months continuance the judge says i will give it to you the opposing counsel says why he says because he waived it now you are telling me that one he cannot waive it but two even though the judge said i did it because he waived it that still itself is okay we go ahead and let him exclude it because the judge might have done something differently is that what you are saying 
 well either you would need more on the record there because if the record was limited to what you just said i dont think there would be a basis for 
 but its possible you could argue looking at the record that the judge should have tried it should have excluded it on a different basis he should have excluded it on the basis of the interests of justice et cetera required so what the judge said just to make it clear is im not even thinking about this different basis though i might im doing it just because he waived it and now you are telling me i take it he cant waive it but nonetheless the error is harmless because he waived it or something like that 
 at this at this point we are not at the harmlessness point yet this would be 
 its not harmless you are saying its a procedural error 
 right and 
 so we dont say the judge is right because he waived it we are saying hes right because the judge made a procedural error im having a hard time following that 
 well anytime you are talking about a waiver or estoppel theory the premise is that there there may well have been underlying error and the question is whether the defendant is precluded and here theres no question there was an underlying error because the findings were not required were not reported in the act but the act does again does not contain an express antiwaiver provision and the speedy trial interests which are the reason for reading to some extent an antiwaiver provision are are not diminished when the court could have properly excluded the time from the act and to the contrary speedy trial interests would be harmed in that manner for three reasons first it gives defendants every reason to delay in hopes of manufacturing a speedy trial violation second waiver and estoppel are generally important to the efficient and orderly conduct of litigation and if you take those that out what you will get is less efficient litigation and more delays which congress recognized when as part of the speedy trial act it required the courts to develop management plans for the efficient handling of cases 
 but you know congress could have could have written it the way the way you are proposing it congress could have said you know when there when when there is good cause for the continuance the clock wont run it didnt say that it it said the judge has to make a finding i mean dont we have to give that some effect you are saying it really doesnt matter whether he makes the finding or not so long as there was good cause so that a finding could have been made that will be enough 
 no our our view is that i mean like anytime the waiver or estoppel is at issue one could say that thats being read into the statute but the point as this court has explained in hillen and and mezzanatto is that those are background principles of law that presumptively apply our view is this a court should make the finding but a a defendant may not challenge the finding if a few conditions are satisfied first the defendant was the one requesting the continuance and benefiting from it second the finding could have been made on the record in the case and third the defendant is responsible in some way for inducing the court not to make the finding it could be by a waiver or it could be the defendants or it could be the court saying i have decided its appropriate to make an ends of justice finding now let me record this in the record and defense counsel saying your honor please dont bother its late we have got four more things to do we dont need the findings in that circumstance as well its not a waiver but defense counsel would have the defendant at that point should not be heard to complain about the absence of a finding that should ultimately 
 well it seems to me the government is equally remiss for not pointing out the obligations of the court under the act but let me ask you this probably you can respond to that as well if you like what are the problems with reindicting i mean how how is the government hurt if it can reindict i recognize that its costly to the system et cetera but is there any real prejudice there 
 well i mean there are two concerns one is as you said the the cost of having to do a brand new jury trial after you have already done a fair one the second is that i mean in this case the trial was N years ago 
 well of course im im supposing that after this rule there would be no trial because there would be if if you dont prevail there wouldnt be a trial 
 oh i well if dismissal was required in this case i think dismissal would be without prejudice as opposed to with prejudice and therefore 
 and im asking are there are there severe costs with that when theres been no trial 
 if there had not already been oh 
 theres theres no trial 
 this is pretrial 
 the the action is dismissed for a speedy trial act violation because the position of the petitioner here is accepted by this court and the government just reindicts 
 oh theres already been a trial 
 im hypothesizing that there hasnt been 
 okay 
 the case is dismissed 
 i see its dismissed before trial 
 and there is a reindictment 
 right i understand 
 how costly is that to the system other than getting the grand jury together 
 sorry i understand yes if if pretrial if the district court dismisses then the government ordinarily could reindict for if the court dismisses without prejudice the government ordinarily could reindict very quickly and the cost to the system would not be great the real cost to the system comes in when the district court does not dismiss and holds the trial because then the trial has been held and then by the time you get back down to the trial court i mean in this case it will probably be N years and at that point sometimes you can do a retrial but sometimes memories fade witnesses are lost other sources of proof are lost and as a result you end up with with fairly you can end up with very severe consequences in situations where the first trial is held 
 in this is there a statute of limitations problem in in these cases if their dismissal is without prejudice 
 no theres a the judicial code contains a a provision that generally contains a N month grace period for limitations following dismissal by a court so we would have i mean by now the limitations period would have run but we would have N months to to reindict 
 counsel 
 mr 
 the the argument you are making is really one of invited error and im not sure it even applies on these facts i mean the the defense lawyer didnt as you hypothesized in one of your answers say something to the effect of dont worry you dont need to make any findings of the ends of justice or anything like that he just said im waiving my speedy trial rights and that may mean hes not gong to argue you know that the ends of justice dont justify it or whatever hes just saying i dont have any objection maybe he assumed that the judge would go on and say okay im making the findings required by subsection N 
 well i think that when a when a litigant expressly waives his rights under an act that the very natural effect of that is to make the court think he does not have to follow that act and that would include the findings requirement 
 well in this case the judge told the defendant i have got a solution to this heres my form 
 no it was the i mean in context there were two at the earlier status conference that does not relate to this hearing but at the earlier status it was defendant who said your honor i want a continuance and i want to waive my rights in response to defendants invocation of a waiver the court said well if you are going to waive you have to waive for all time because the court was concerned the defendant would selectively waive until it was inconvenient for the court to try the case we dont defend the courts response to that but the point is that even then it was the defendant who raised waiver first and then at this status conference regarding this particular continuance it was defendant was the only one talking about waiver defendant said defendant initially raised it and said i i waive my rights then came back to it again i waive my rights just give me the continuance and the court said i mean the court did say that well if you have already waived you dont have to again but he then said that notwithstanding the waiver he couldnt give the defendant an openended amount of time because this is a criminal trial so it was defendant who was who was pressing this at all times 
 do you have any idea how often this this sort of situation comes up where theres an alleged violation of the act and then a denial by the district court of a pretrial motion to dismiss 
 i think that happens with some regularity theres quite a lot of court of appeals case law in which defendants are protesting speedy trial violations i mean actually quite a lot 
 you you made an argument a moment ago which included the point that he asked for this particular relief and represented what he needed to do if he got the relief the continuance you you came right up within a step of of making a judicial estoppel claim although you did not use those terms i have two questions did the government raise at least the the theory of judicial estoppel in the litigation before it reached this point and the second question is even if the government did not raise that term asked for for estoppel to be applied in those terms did the government make the same argument that you have just made which emphasizes the fact that he asked for it and he represented the reasons for for needing it 
 yes in the in the court of the answer your first question in the court of appeals we referred to our argument as one of waiver rather than estoppel in part because thats what the second circuit had in in the past referred to it as being and yes in substance we were we we raised i mean we were raising a similar waiver argument below as the one that we are now we dont think it matters greatly whether one calls it waiver or estoppel except that we do think that estoppel is the is the the preferable way of looking at because we are as as has been pointed out we are talking here not just about a waiver but also about a situation where a defendant requests relief 
 yes the difference between acquiescence and and potentially sandbagging 
 yes i mean here the the defendant is affirmatively requesting relief on the basis of one one position and is now seeking dismissal based on the fact that his first position was accepted and received that relief and thats a situation in which judicial estoppel is is frankly tailormade for and i think the fact that judicial estoppel prevents that very situation helps to underscore the that if if congress really wanted to 
 except except where theres a public policy against what you want to estop him into doing i mean it seems to me for the same reason that you dont allow a waiver you shouldnt allow an estoppel theres a public policy against it the the congress wanted these things tried promptly and and whether he merely waives or or goes further and affirmatively causes the court to do something which it shouldnt have done you are just as much violating the policy it seems to me 
 well i think the i mean i i agree that i mean whether its waiver or its estoppel if congress manifests an affirmative intent to displace those doctrines they dont apply and it doesnt matter which which one you are under but the the affirmative intent that congress manifested here notwithstanding i mean remember theres no express antiwaiver or antiestoppel provision but the affirmative intent is to protect the publics interest in a speedy trial and that that intent is entirely protected when a delay could be is permitted by the substantive standards of the act and the only error is a procedural one that the defendant helped to induce the court to commit and i mentioned in that circumstance theres not only no delay that was not contemplated by congress but as i mentioned before there are three reasons that permitting a defendant to seek dismissal in that circumstance would actually harm speedy trial rights first the incentive for defendants to delay second the inefficiency and the third is that remember one of the main reasons if not the main reason that congress wanted speedy trials was that it was concerned that defendants out on bail were committing crimes and congress concern with crime prevention is not served in the least by letting a defendant seek dismissal of an indictment based on a purely procedural error that he helped to cause 
 if if what you say is true i dont know why it makes any difference that the defendant led the court into it if you if you believe that this is just a procedural nicety that was not complied with why shouldnt you do the same thing when when the court fails to make the finding but could have made the finding whether or not the defendant was the one that led him into it 
 well the question then would be harmless error analysis i mean we agree the statute requires the finding to be made it was not made therefore there was an error and its the defendant inducing the court to 
 its harmless error because he the evidence of guilt was substantial what how does the harmless error work 
 no if if one moved beyond the inducement and into harmless error the question would be would be that there here the the error i think as i mentioned before the error here would be the failure would would be the clerical one the error to record findings in the act and i think and we would agree that the act pointing to the second question now but the act does expressly say that if a defendant is not tried within N relevant days the indictment shall be dismissed and that suggests that harmless error analysis would not be appropriate to the question whether N or N days of delay is appropriate because congress said N is N but when the error is not that but the error is failing to record something in the record thats a distinct type of error thats not covered by the mandatory dismissal provision and it could be considered harmless especially in circumstances where the record reflects 
 why do you why do you put that in a separate category its kind of unusual for congress to put that type of a requirement in the statute they could have normally i suspect they normally would write it you know you you they are excludable only if the court finds in the interest of justice but they went further and they said if the court sets forth orally or in writing in the record of the case i mean they set it forth as a separate requirement i dont know that we can give it sort of a secondclass status 
 well i i agree that that section is different from the incompetency exclusion for example which i will turn to in a minute in that it does tie the the findings to the excludability and that makes the the harmless error argument that we have on that issue obviously more difficult than on the the incompetency issue but its still i think it ultimately comes down to how you how you view the error is the error not trying someone within N days or is the error not recording a finding in the record and if if you focus on on the findings aspect 
 or say the error is not complying with the act 
 right and then but the but the i mean ordinarily that just not complying with the act generally is harmless and the question would be is is that because remember the the only thing thats subject to mandatory dismissal is not trying someone within N relevant days 
 yes within N relevant days counted as the statute requires them to be counted which includes the requirement of this finding set forth in the record before you can stop the clock running for you know for some period i dont think that thats i dont think thats very complicated 
 right and then i mean if thats the way its viewed then on the first time period the then we would stand on our stand on either of the the waiver and estoppel argument or also on the possibility that another middle ground would be if what we are missing is a finding in the record the other option would be to remand for the court to clarify the record 
 which court 
 oh no that pardon 
 the is that is there any reason to believe that the judge of course would clarify it and say the ends of justice if we took your remand solution 
 right and obviously ordinarily courts would not be doing that its a very inefficient thing to do in the ordinary course but here where the transcript does reflect the court actually considered on the one hand the defendants need for additional time and on the other hand the interest in trying trying criminal cases sooner rather than later and balanced them by granting a lesser 
 well 
 it does seem more reasonable but 
 it seems to me that in this case that that allpurpose waiver that the judge and not for the first time proposed is is what caused all this and and my question that i had is knowing that this was the judges practice and indeed he had written about it did the us attorneys office try to do something to say look the act doesnt permit that kind of thing 
 at at the time i mean there was there was especially this was N years ago there was in some sense still is quite a lot of confusion in the bar on these issues because theres no express antiwaiver provision theres an end and as i said the the second circuit in gambino had held waiver is not ordinarily appropriate but had not said it was never appropriate so there was some confusion but what what the government never did was to encourage a waiver or to encourage any of these delays either now in this i blurred to some extent in the second question presented and talking about the the remand and the harmlessness on the second question presented the first question is whether the incompetency exclusion applies in the first place in our view its a very simple exclusion if if delay results from the defendants incompetency the time is excluded and if the defendant is incompetent delay results from that because a person cannot be tried when he is incompetent because we have a finding here the defendant was incompetent during the relevant period of time the exclusion applies 
 but it was not known at the time that he was incompetent and and therefore that could not have been the reason that he was not being tried the reason he was not being tried was that the that there was pending before the judge the inquiry into whether he was competent 
 well the the act has a lengthy series of these resulting from exclusions and with the exception of which is unusual in terms of the ends of justice finding these operate automatically as this court said in henderson its its an objective standard if if the defendant could not have been tried then then the delay resulted at least as a concurrent cause from that and theres and its its very important to understand too that in the context of especially the the exclusion for when pretrial motions are pending the courts of appeals have unanimously held that a more complicated causation analysis not only is not required but would throw a wrench into the practical application of the act because what happens for example is someone files a pretrial motion and the parties assume that the the clock is turned off then for at least some time but a defendant later argues that well the same delay would have resulted anyway because say the judge was on vacation or the judge was planning on recusing himself and reassigning the case and at that point the courts have recognized that you dont look to try to figure out which of several potential causes is is the relevant one they are all potential objective concurrent causes and any other approach make it very difficult to administer the act 
 you really dont know the answer of whether the clock is running until the finding is made if the if the judge finds that that hes not incompetent well too bad you know the speedy trial act requires dismissal on the other hand if the judge finds that he is incompetent to be tried there hasnt been a violation of the act i mean its a very strange situation and it also as as the the other side points out it it puts considerable pressure on the judge when when he is in violation of the speedy trial act to find that the individual is incompetent because otherwise there has to be a dismissal 
 i i dont think its appropriate to presume that an article iii judge would have a defendant imprisoned and committed if he was not actually incompetent but you are right that the incompetency exclusion is is along with the unavailability of the defendant or witness exclusions are somewhat unusual in that you could discover after the fact that they applied but the reason is that if if you had tried to try him sooner you would have discovered the same thing he actually was incompetent the witness actually was unavailable and from a speedy trial act perspective it makes no sense to say the speedy trial clock ran because you didnt try a defendant when he was legally unable to be tried 
 are you are you relying to any extent on something that i think you brought up he also could not have been tried because the prosecutor was having a difficult pregnancy and she was on extended leave which was occurring in this period 
 we havent relied on that because that would have been the that thats an appropriate basis for an ends of justice continuance but no continuance was ever sought or granted for the relevant period so we although that is true that an ends of justice continuance might have been granted for that reason there was no continuance of any kind granted during that period so we are relying solely on the plain language of the incompetency exclusion if you think about it 
 even if we agree with you on the incompetency exclusion we still have to reach the waiver for all time question correct you dont argue that the incompetency goes back that far do you 
 no we we no with respect to the first time period we are relying on the specific waiver that was tendered in connection with that actual continuance 
 you are not suggesting he was incompetent during that period as well 
 oh that defendant was incompetent the whole time 
 yes 
 no there was actually earlier on in the case there was there were three competency hearings the first one he was held competent and that that was earlier on in the proceedings the finding of incompetency in the record here is the defendant found the defendant incompetent at the end of the relevant period based entirely on evidence and argument presented at the beginning of the relevant period so when the when the court held that the defendant must be incompetent based on that evidence he was saying the defendant necessarily was saying the defendant must have been incompetent during the entire relevant period based on the evidence from the beginning of the period 
 am am i correct that the the particular provision that you think is relevant here is is on page N of the the appendix in the blue brief 
 no im sorry it is deals with proceedings regarding the defendants incompetency 
 i have i have got it okay 
 and that applies whether the defendant is competent or not we are relying on which applies when the defendant was incompetent 
 what what do you make of the language any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent i mean the claim here is that that the that the delay did not result from that fact but simply from the failure of of the judge to make that determination so that what you are really doing is making a harmless error analysis 
 well im happy to move to that as well but before that i mean it is there can be concurrent causes and there can be objective concurrent causes and the defendant could not have been tried during the relevant time period and therefore objectively speaking that was i mean if the if the court had tried to try him 
 okay but isnt that a 
 during the relevant time period he couldnt 
 isnt that a harmless error analysis rather than a a subsection analysis 
 well i think congress you are right that its based in part on the principle that look of course he couldnt have been tried then but no congress also made that relevant whether theres a violation at all just to simplify things lets take that off the table if the defendant is incompetent there certainly couldnt be a constitutional speedy trial violation lets just take it off the table for for the act purposes as well the argument has been made that 
 but but i guess my only point is that does not say any period during which the defendant is mentally incompetent it says any period of delay resulting from the fact that he was mentally incompetent and this did not result from that fact until at the end of the period the judge says oh i find him incompetent so that any period after that would be the result of the fact that he was incompetent but the the delay up to that point was attributable solely to the judges failure to make a determination 
 if i could answer the question 
 if it was a question yes 
 the the fact 
 it was it was cleverly disguised but it really was a question 
 i i i will try to give a cleverly disguised answer 
 isnt isnt that so 
 the the fact existed all along i mean the the fact doesnt come into existence once its found the finding reflects the fact that the fact of an incompetency had existed during the entire relevant period 
 thank you counsel mr zas you have N minutes remaining 
 mr chief justice id like to pick up on questions that both you and justice scalia asked regarding the the language of the statute one of the courts bedrock principles is that judges are not free to rewrite the statute that congress has enacted this statute and the whole statutory scheme here speaks very clearly and very precisely and it would be unwise even if permitted for the court to start tinkering with it because the whole system will start to unravel if the if the requirement of express findings and reasons turns into a could have or would have or should have contest in which case trial judges will take the act less seriously knowing that the court of appeals could make the findings for them and it will make the court of appeals job harder because they will be guessing after the fact what discretionary decision the trial judge would have made this statute the ends of justice provision is very clear the government has cited no ambiguity and it controls because the findings were not made whether they could have been made or should have been made or would have been made they werent made and therefore the time ran and dismissal is required now the government proceeds under the false assumption that but for the waiver the judge would have granted this continuance on january N N theres absolutely no support for that in the record even before this occasion on november N th N which was the prior court appearance the court said you are not getting another adjournment unless you waive for all time so theres no reason to think that at this later date the court was about to say well forget the waiver okay i will give you N months its its the waiver that is providing the basis for the exclusion the judge if pushed would have said no we are going to trial soon no waiver no more time so its a false assumption id like to turn to the second period again the government again assumes that when the judge found mr zedner incompetent in march of N that that is a retroactive determination that he was incompetent from july august september october november et cetera and as the court is aware 
 it goes back some way because hes looking at reports from those earlier times its not only effective as of the date he makes the finding 
 well the the finding is effective from that point forward that has to be the case because as justice scalia pointed out its important for the parties to know as matters are unfolding what the speedy trial clock is that way the government knows to push the cases that are approaching the N day limit to trial people cant know that answer if everyone is waiting to find out what the outcome of a pending motion is and the defendant in fact couldnt move for dismissal under the act until the the judge said after N or N years i find the defendant incompetent 
 what do you mean 
 i guess you can be im sorry go ahead 
 if the judge when he finally found the defendant competent had said expressly and i i made this determination in my mind shortly after the hearing and the the briefs that were submitted at that time but now im putting it on the record that wouldnt be sufficient 
 no your honor if the judge had said i knew this all along back when i heard the evidence that this defendant was incompetent that would be an even more egregious violation the court is not supposed to sit and just let the defendant sit out on the streets for month after month after month when when the defendant is incompetent the court is supposed to make a a prompt finding 
 where does the act say that that there has to be a finding at the time 
 well the court said the act says it in in section thats the the in the appendix to the blue brief on page N the act excludes time while the proceeding is is going on for examinations and hearings et cetera but at the end it excludes only delay reasonably attributable to any period not to exceed N days during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court so so if the 
 no but theres no provision is there that says that the finding under that there has to even be a finding under much less when the finding has to be made 
 if i may answer the question your honor well the only finding that the court has to make under is that the defendant is incompetent that automatically will exclude the time going forward until the defendant is restored to competency 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in medimmune incorporated versus genentech mr kester 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court as of this morning it is exactly N years ago to the day minus N months that this court heard argument challenging the new federal declaratory judgment act of N in an action to construe an insurance contract and exactly N years N days later in a unanimous opinion written by chief justice hughes joined by justices stone brandeis and others the act was held fully consistent with article iii of the constitution this morning you are here because an action was brought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical manufacturer need not play pay large sums under a license as patent royalties under a patent it contends is invalid unenforceable and not infringed but is paying royalties under protest in the meantime that complaint was ordered dismissed by the federal circuit as outside the article iii judicial power of the united states in detail the petitioner medimmune is a biotech company formed in N during the N s 
 mr kester would it 
 yes 
 would it would your position be different if the contract contained a specific the license a specific provision specifying that the licensee may not sue 
 no it would not your honor because 
 you do you think such a provision would be enforceable 
 i doubt it would be enforceable it would be a matter under the lear case lear against adkins it would be an it would be an affirmative defense if such if such a claim were raised this case is here at the level of subjectmatter jurisdiction 
 excuse me i dont i dont understand what you just said you mean it would be enforceable that if such a suit were brought the licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis for dismissing the suit is that 
 under N under N 
 okay 
 perhaps 
 so then it is enforceable 
 no but 
 no 
 your point is its not jurisdictional 
 its not jurisdictional exactly justice souter this is a jurisdictional ruling and thats all that this court granted certiorari on 
 well but as a matter of policy we at some point either in this case or some later case may have to address the question of whether or not such a provision is enforceable if it is we may be not be talking about much its just going to be boilerplate in every license agreement and thats the end of it and it 
 and so 
 but it on the other hand it may be that there are reasons not to enforce this so that we dont have courts flooded with lawsuits et cetera et cetera 
 and those reasons i would suggest justice kennedy were taken care of in lear for the most part in N provisions in license contracts that prevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable under the patent laws of the united states but then i as i was saying that is a matter of patent law thats not a matter of jurisdictional law we are here 
 well lets look at what might be a matter of jurisdictional law i take it from your position theres nothing preventing genentech from suing either is there in other words to establish the validity of their patent 
 it has it has happened on various occasions that patentees have brought suit to establish the validity of 
 against licensees 
 against licensees and others and the 
 against licensees who are not claiming that the patent is invalid and where is the controversy 
 the controversy could arise in any number of ways 
 i mean i can see if the if licensee says the patent is invalid that the patentee says paying its royalties how does it 
 the patentee could be paying his royalties the patentee could also be putting ads in the paper saying this is not a valid patent it could it could have acquired a lot of publicity and in the end there could be reasons and there have been such cases which we cited N of our brief where such suits have been brought but 
 if it if the if the if the licensee came into court and said im not contesting this patent that would be the end of it wouldnt it 
 if the licensee said i am not contesting that patent that could be 
 oh but the patentee would just say look we have a license i think the patents valid and you owe me a dollar a unit the licensee said well i dont think they are its valid so i owe you nothing and they settle on a license for N cents why cant the patentee say you know if i get a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid i can charge a higher license either when this agreement expires or for other licenses 
 that i agree with that mr chief justice but the practicality is that a patentee starts out with essentially a judgment that the patent is valid there is a presumption of validity and to challenge that patent that presumption of validity is a very difficult undertaking most of them dont bother why would they if they are receiving if they are receiving 
 im trying to see how far you want are willing to push your argument that just because theres been an agreement or perhaps even a settlement that that somehow or another doesnt moot the controversy the underlying legal dispute and it i gather your answer to me is that genentech or a patentee can sue even though they have an existing they are getting royalties from the licensee they can still sue the licensee 
 a settlement does not deprive a federal court of subjectmatter jurisdiction thats the narrow point that is before this before this court 
 why arent you you said the only question before the court is jurisdictional if thats so why isnt your position that the federal circuit put the wrong label on this that license is listed in N as an affirmative defense so whatever the outcome should be the wrong label should is was used it shouldnt be a subjectmatter jurisdiction shouldnt be N it should be an N affirmative defense and then the you are out of the jurisdiction box but you are left with the same underlying question 
 but not the same underlying question justice ginsburg with respect because then you are in a situation like the business forms case in the seventh circuit which came out shortly after the lear there was a settle settlement and the and it was argued that the settlement was not effective because of the lear decision and parties cant settle themselves out of the lear decision but that is all under N and not N this case involves a N motion not a N 
 but what 
 motion 
 good would it do suppose we said federal circuit you put the wrong label on it it should be N not N or perhaps even N affirmative defense then you go back to the federal circuit and they will come up with the same decision that as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties you have and they just put a different label on it you have 
 they 
 you have no you have not stated a claim 
 that would be effectively overruling lear which is what i think is what many of the parties in this case actually seek to do lear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to patent licenses a licensee can challenge the validity the enforceability of the patent thats because theres a public interest in this as well parties cannot simply contract with each other and prevent a challenge to a to a patent 
 but then 
 license 
 the federal circuit distinguished lear and said what in lear the licensee had stopped paying royalties isnt that so 
 that those were the facts of lear but it happened that way in lear but that wasnt the reasoning of lear lear would not totally cover that situation but we would submit to this court it shouldnt make any difference the reasoning of lear is the same the licensee cannot by contract be estopped licensee estoppel from challenging a patent 
 so theres no way i under your view that a patent holder can protect itself from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement of any kind 
 i suspect there are many ways mr chief justice but not by throwing them out on a jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the lawsuit 
 how about 
 there may be ways this could be arranged at the second level through 
 well what are those ways i mean the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities in the government brief one you rejected and the other that was mentioned was if you sue if the licensee sues then the royalty fees will be upped would that be effective 
 that is a question that would arise under lear against adkins and the question before this court in that situation if it got to this court would be is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy that was so firmly expressed by justice harlan in lear and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of this court 
 so you have rejected both of the governments suggestions on what the patent holder might do to protect itself do you have anything concrete that you would concede the patent holder could do 
 i dont think that i have rejected both the governments suggestions i have said that they raise problems on as to the scope of lear 
 with respect to whether we are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we are talking about an affirmative defense assuming jurisdiction is there any is there any reason for us to accept your position other than the reason that you have mentioned a number of times and that is the adoption and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent challenges freely is that the nub of our reasoning if we were to support your position either jurisdictionally in this case or in recognizing or the in dealing with the affirmative defense in another case 
 not quite justice souter i would say the nub of your position is the altvater case the aetna case the maryland 
 well altvater is difficult for you isnt it because there was an injunction in altvater wasnt there 
 that but that but was 
 which raises an entirely different policy issue 
 well i would say what it what it raises is simply an extra fact but it wasnt a necessary fact because this court in altvater specifically pointed out that even if there werent an injunction there there would be there would be the danger forced on the licensee of an infringement suit and an infringement suit means possibly an injunction of the patent treble damages any number of sanctions an injunction suit can put a company out of business especially like a company like my client here and 
 but that is that is a good reason and i take it its your logic that that is a good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part of the licensee to challenge 
 right 
 in other words the nub of your position as i understand it is the public policy that favors relative 
 it 
 freedom to challenge 
 its more its more than public policy its article iii article iii says that you can bring a lawsuit in this situation and that was settled 
 no 
 in aetna 
 no i realize that but i mean what we have got in this case and in any of these cases is a question of linedrawing under article iii and your argument is you want to draw the line where you want it drawn primarily because there are practical reasons to favor a public policy of free challenge 
 what we are presenting in this case is a dispute about money its not abstract its not hypothetical its not conjectural it is concrete immediate all the facts are in its definitely adversarial its legal 
 you well you can have such a dispute on a theoretical question between i dont know the aclu and the national rifle association but that doesnt create a case or controversy what is the injury the imminent injury to your to your client that is the basis for the case or controversy 
 the 
 is it anything other than i have to pay the royalties that i agreed to pay 
 it is the it is that i am having to pay the royalties that i say i did not agree to pay because this is an invalid patent money is being paid by my client every quarter large amounts of money that is a major injury 
 well if you dont 
 and if 
 think 
 and if 
 if you dont think 
 is it is it unlawful to agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent 
 it is 
 i mean you are speaking as though somehow that such a contract is contrary to public policy and void 
 no we are saying that that isnt what we agreed to we are saying this is a contract dispute and the whole purpose of the 
 well then why are you paying it if you if you dont think you owe it 
 because the 
 because of the threat of treble damages 
 the threat 
 and injunction 
 of this 
 if we are trying to figure out where the public policy is here why dont we give some weight to those congressional enactments that obviously fortify the strength of the patent in other words congress passed these provisions providing for treble damages for attorneys fees and 
 but 
 and to respond that theres got to be a public policy to counterbalance that congress can always do that if it wants but it didnt it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the patent holders 
 but mr chief justice congress can also amend the declaratory judgment act if it wants and congress was proud of the declaratory judgment act when it was passed in N and the legislative history of it and nothing in the text is contrary says the purpose of this is so that contracts can be resolved without breach and judicial determinations can be had its like a noninvasive a less invasive kind of surgery 
 mr kester may i ask you this question is it your view that genprobe represented a change in the law 
 absolutely 
 were there before genprobe was decided were there any cases like this case that were decided 
 there were many your honor and they were decided 
 where the where the licensee brought suit challenging validity while the license was still in full 
 we 
 force 
 we had suits in the third circuit the seventh circuit the second circuit and even in the federal circuit in its early days where it quoted those cases which said it is not necessary for the licensee to stop paying payments in order for article iii to be satisfied this case came as a shock in N and in fact the judges below in this series of cases all said we thought it was settled law the other way all this case represents from our point of view is lets go back to the way it has always been id like to reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you mr kester ms maynard 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court there is a concrete dispute between the parties about their legal rights and obligations if that dispute is resolved money will change hands that is an article iii case or controversy 
 how do you ever end these things lets say they have this dispute they bring the litigation and they settle it they are saying okay we are going to settle it instead of paying a license fee of N cents its going to be N cents and we will go on then they can sue again i take it 
 in that situation recognizing thats not the situation we have here 
 can they settle that by the way is it all right to settle it or is that interfere with the policy that patents have to be open to challenge 
 may i if i can answer the first question first 
 either one 
 if there were to be a settlement in the second case the it would not be an article iii case or controversy problem with the second case and that suit should not be dismissed under N 
 okay 
 the in that case the patent holder might have a valid N defense and the suit laying aside enforceability issues that you raised may be easily resolved on that ground but in terms of the question before the court today that wouldnt be an article iii matter i think as a policy matter so moving off the question before the court right now as a policy matter the its not clear from this courts cases exactly what types of agreements would be enforceable i think theres a spectrum of cases one can imagine ranging from pope the type of promise that was extracted in pope which this court held was unenforceable 
 well i think you overread pope all pope said was that they are not going to grant specific performance in fact they have said whatever you may think of the policy here we dont specific performance calls on the equitable discretion and we are not going to do it but i dont read pope as holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable in 
 well 
 other words you are maybe entitled to damages and that may be measured by the license fee that you agreed to pay 
 well there certainly would be a question though the way that lear read pope and under lear about whether a bare agreement not to challenge licenses especially ones like in pope where they agreed not to challenge the license even beyond the term would be enforceable and the government thinks theres a spectrum one at one end of the spectrum would be licenses like those in pope and at the other end of the spectrum would be a consent decree entered after settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where the which included an agreement not to settle now thats clearly not what we have here 
 now is if i guess there are three possible positions on the question of whether a licensee can attack a contract a patent where he has a license and wants to keep the contract one he can never do it two he can always do it three it depends on what the contract says now do any of those questions have anything to do with the question before us which is whether it is a case or controversy 
 no your honor 
 all right if we were to reach the question which is very interesting what is the governments position as to which of those three positions is the right position were we to reach it i agree with you i dont see it in front of us but maybe it is if it were what would be your view 
 the governments view is that theres a spectrum along the spectrum and it would have you would have to consider each case on its terms and its not clear from this courts cases where the policies in that 
 all right so basically though you are not certain the governments view would be it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the patent is invalid whether the licensee can do it that probably but you are not certain and you havent made up your mind definitely because it is not in this case but you think its going to be something they could regulate themselves by contract 
 its certainly not foreclosed by this courts precedent and its an open question where the policies how they would weigh out theres no language in this license however suggesting any type of settlement and moreover i think its important to recognize that the parties here actually have a concrete dispute about what the licensing agreement means count one in the complaint is asking for a declaration 
 well you dont think that matters though do you i mean even if they all agree theres no dispute about what the license agreement means your position is still the same right there is an article iii controversy because they challenge the validity of the patent 
 if the parties have a concrete dispute about the validity of the patent and it would affect their rights and obligations in the way that it would here in other words that money will no longer be due to the respondents if the patents invalid 
 is 
 and the 
 that always the case i mean could can you enforce a license agreement based on an invalid patent you thought it was valid parties had a dispute about it whether it is valid you entered into agreement say well lets split the difference we will you know N cents rather than a dollar or nothing its determined that the patent is invalid can the patentee then still say well you still owe me the money we have kind of cut split the difference that was part of the agreement 
 it might depend on whether there was consideration beyond the patent itself in the in this in this case though the petitioner claims that if the if the patent is invalid they no longer owe licensing fees and under lear they would be entitled to the licensing fees that they have paid since they began challenging back so its clear that under either the contract or a question of 
 contractually they say that thats their contractual right 
 they claim that under the licensing agreement they only owe royalties on valid claims thats count one of the complaint in the 
 where does that appear in the licensing agreement or 
 where does it appear in the licensing agreement 
 yes i took them as just asserting a general proposition of law that where they have agreed to pay royalties because of a patent if the patent is invalid they dont have to pay royalties not because theres some special provision in this contract 
 the parties actually have a concrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing agreement in that regard justice scalia on page N of the joint appendix is the provision about which they have a dispute and the language in there provides that they will pay on substances which would if not licensed under this agreement infringe one or more claims of either or both of the shamir patents or coexpression patents which have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction there was similar language in 
 so theres really not much at issue in this case and thats clearly a case of controversy isnt it there is a dispute over the meaning of that provision of the agreement 
 yes your honor 
 gee theres less here than meets the eye 
 thats what the government believes your honor its also the licensee also does not need to breach the licensing agreement in order to create a case or controversy the licensee is currently paying royalties that it does not believe it owes and that it believes it would be entitled to have back if it should prevail on its interpretation of the of the patent and the licensing agreement it doesnt have to make that injury more severe by breaching thats clear from this courts decision in altvater in altvater royalties were being demanded and royalties were being paid but nevertheless this court held 
 well but that its been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction 
 yes it was pursuant to injunction but that was not important to the courts reasoning what the court said is you need not suffer patent damages in order to bring the suit not a contempt you need not breach the injunction and put yourself at risk of treble damages for infringement it was the patent damages that put the licensee at risk and thats the same risk that the petitioner faces here and should not have to bear in order to bring suit the case or controversy is whether or not the they owe the royalties the whole point of the declaratory judgment act was to allow contracting parties not to have to sever their ongoing contractual relations in order to get disputes resolved between 
 do you think 
 themselves 
 do you think there would be a case or controversy if genentech were suing to establish the validity of its patent 
 in the situation that we have here your honor 
 yes 
 yes i do where the petitioner claims that the patent is invalid that they could that the petitioners claims unsettles their right damages their property value potentially and that they could bring a declaratory judgment action of validity 
 and what would their what would their concrete injury be what is the threatened imminent injury that they would assert in that in that action 
 well right now 
 you have a licensee whos paying the license fees what is their concrete injury 
 it from the moment the petitioner has an argument that from the moment it ceased it starts claiming that the patent is invalid and pays under protest that it is entitled to those royalties back 
 but 
 the 
 so long as they are still paying the royalties isnt that sort of an abstract disagreement i mean its sort of like the aclu saying that the patents invalid you know its a nice theoretical question that we can argue about but as long as they are paying the royalties wheres the concrete injury 
 well i think technically justice scalia they probably have a claim for patent infringement to which the defense as justice ginsburg 
 i 
 points out 
 i find it 
 would be an easy defense 
 i 
 so theres not an article iii lack of case or controversy which is 
 i find it 
 whats the question before 
 very difficult 
 the court 
 to see how there would be a proper declaratory judgment action brought by the patentee here its just not the kind of a situation where you can have a mirrorimage suit i dont see what the 
 well you need 
 patentee 
 you may i answer that question you need not have a mirrorimage suit in that sense justice scalia and altvater makes that clear in altvater the patentees claim was 
 thats fine 
 much narrower than the counterclaim and nevertheless the court allowed that counterclaim to proceed 
 thank you counsel ms mahoney 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court id like to start with the fact that there are four counts in the complaint for declaratory relief the first one is styled as a contractual relations claims the other three are styled as patent law claims and its important to emphasize at the outset that this court in skelly oil in calderone and in really all of the cases has said its very important to look behind the labels that a declaratory judgment act plaintiff puts on their claims we need to actually see what is the cause of action they are trying to adjudicate so we can do an accurate assessment of justiciability standing ripeness federalquestion jurisdiction i want to start by explaining why there is no contract claim at issue here you heard today they are trying to salvage this say that theres a contract dispute a dispute about the terms of the contract they didnt argue that below and with good reason and id just point you to the briefs in the federal circuit roman numeral i which is all about the improper dismissal of the declaratory judgment act claims refers to the fact these are quote patentlaw claims end quote at page N nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the proper interpretation of the contract terms and let me explain why the contract terms which were just read to you is section N of N at jaN of the license says that there is an obligation to pay royalties for synagis on any claim not any valid claim any claim that has not been held invalid by a court or other competent jurisdiction from which no appeal has or may be taken now they never said below that clause means that we can come to court and have the court decide whether this patent is valid and depending on whether we win or not then we can stop paying and the reason they didnt make that argument is it was rejected by this court a hundred years ago in united states versus harvey steel very similar clause the united states says this means that we dont have to pay if the patent is invalid and in an opinion by justice holmes this court rejected it out of hand by and said this was a conventional proviso we dont even need to look to evidence of the partys intent because this is the standard proviso it does not mean and they said it was a twisted interpretation that the government was offering it doesnt mean that the licensee quote thought the patent bad and would like to have the court say so now end quote yet that is exactly 
 was that a case about article iii case or controversy 
 it is in the following sense your honor they cant just show up here today and say well there really is a dispute about the contract but they never argued below and is foreclosed 
 shouldnt we send that back i mean i thought we were here to decide one question that the federal circuit has said that unless there is a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit you cant bring a declaratory judgment action because of the constitution of the united states now i have to admit i have looked up or i have had my law clerk look up probably now hundreds of cases and we cant find in any case such a requirement indeed the very purpose as i we have just heard the sg say of this act the declaratory judgment act seems to be to allow people who a contract who are in a real concrete disagreement to get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the contract but i might be wrong about that but you have now argued a different point 
 well 
 so isnt the right thing for us to do to decide the issue in front of us and then send it back if you are right that they have to pay whether they win or lose if they are right that they promise not to sue if you are right on N other grounds you might win but should we decide those grounds today why 
 well first of all with respect to this issue whether there would be jurisdiction over a real live contract dispute they never argued it your honor its not part of this case the federal circuit didnt address it because they didnt argue it because its foreclosed by 
 but the question 
 a precedent a hundred 
 the question that is presented to us whatever they suggested at this oral argument that wasnt in iii the question it presented to us is was the federal circuit right when they said you have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a reasonable apprehension that you will be sued 
 your honor that is the right that is the right starting point for a test depending on the cause of action they are seeking to adjudicate in here what the federal circuit properly understood is that they are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an infringement action under the patent laws and just like in steffel if you are trying to adjudicate on an anticipatory basis an enforcement action you have to show that you would reasonably fear that enforcement action and in fact steffel uses that language and poe versus ullman dismisses a case for failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution but then you have to go one step beyond and that is to say are they is the cause of action not ripening because the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that would be cognizable coercion thats the test thats used in steffel for in essence being able to test a defenses to a cause of action that 
 and why 
 an enforcement action 
 doesnt that work here 
 it doesnt work here for several reasons most fundamentally this is a settlement i mean mr steffel did not enter into a settlement or a compromise with the prosecutor he wasnt complying because he was under an agreement to do so here it has been settled for forever that if a an agreement if you are making payments pursuant to an agreement in the nature of a compromise you cant come and say that its been coerced or its a form of duress 
 what is the 
 why should we accept the characterization that its a compromise as i and maybe im just factually wrong here i thought at the time they entered into the license agreement they had some disagreements about the scope of the thenpatent the scope of the anticipated patent and so on and they couldnt very well be resolved but they were they were not settling in the in the classic sense of the word a let us say a focus claim one against the other 
 i think the answer your honor is they werent settling for all time in the sense that they could never get out of the deal certainly they could repudiate and then go ahead and sue but yet at page N of their petition they expressly say the reason they entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the costs and risks of litigation it is the reason 
 but had they gotten to the point prior to the execution of the contract in which one party was saying you may not do this and the other party was saying oh yes i can so that there there was a focus controversy that would have been the subject matter of a conventional lawsuit then and there had there not been this license agreement 
 not exactly but what they did was they headed it off at the pass they understood that 
 but the question is how far ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a settlement in the sense that you are using that term 
 its a compromise its a compromise of the very claims they are trying to adjudicate here what they want to adjudicate are affirmative defenses to a patent infringement action that is not a ripe claim and there is not sufficient immediacy because they are preventing that claim from ripening by continuing to make voluntary payments 
 but 
 under their 
 but you 
 agreement 
 right but you were saying that the status of that agreement for purposes of the jurisdictional question here is exactly the same as the status of an agreement that they might have entered into after one party had brought suit against the other and 
 well 
 and they they had settled and then later on somebody wanted to repudiate the settlement 
 i dont know if its exactly the status for instance in a settlement after litigation has been filed i think that lear would say that you cant even repudiate that but certainly so there might be some differences but from 
 in any event 
 the standpoint of coercion 
 its equivalent to a settlement after a formal demand has been made 
 it is equivalent to that in the following sense they understood that if they if they didnt get a license that they would be exposed to genentechs claims under the under the infringement laws and in order to avoid that exposure even though they had all the information they needed to assess the validity of this patent at the time 
 suppose they didnt have all the information suppose you enter into a license agreement you are convinced as the one thats going to pay the license fee that its a good patent after the agreements signed the technological advances other disclosures indicate that the patent is deficient could you sue then 
 no i dont think so unless 
 well but then so then the argument that you have made is just not 
 no i 
 relevant for us the fact that they knew everything 
 they did 
 and it also means that this isnt really a settlement in any respect 
 its a compromise of claims that could be brought 
 ms mahoney can i ask this question supposing at the time they negotiate the license agreement theres some uncertainty about whether the patent is valid or not so at the end of the license agreement they agree on the royalties the term and the everything it covers but they put in a provision and say we are not entirely sure the patent is valid so we reserve the right to bring an action challenging the validity of the patent we will pay royalties in the meantime and the you will accept these royalties as sufficient for the use of the patent that if we win you dont have to pay royals if we lose you do would that be a valid provision 
 i dont think so but that would certainly be a closer case if there 
 but would it 
 but i 
 not be precisely the same issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether theres a case or controversy 
 no i dont think so because the real issue in terms of steffel is whether you can say that the party is being coerced and at least in your hypothetical you could say that they have 
 hes not being coerced but hes bargaining a little better royalty rate than he will otherwise would have to pay 
 well in terms of whether they are if the parties expressly agreed that that was part of their deal then you at least wouldnt say that there was an issue of coercion but here that isnt what happened instead they used 
 no im really asking 
 a standard proviso 
 whether the parties could agree to create a case or controversy 
 i think probably not your honor i think 
 lets suppose 
 that thats one of the 
 well 
 one of the problems 
 will you assume justice stevens hypothetical assume it take it as given they did put that in i know you think they didnt but i want to assume it 
 uhhuh 
 now id like to also assume 
 could i have a review of the bidding what 
 go back what is the hypothetical 
 the hypothetical is 
 continue on 
 that they write into the contract the party whos the licensee says and we stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is invalid nonetheless the licensee wants a license for business reasons therefore the licensee and the licensor agrees that after they sign the contract and hes paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties he can go into court and challenge the patent so we assume thats written into the contract 
 uhhuh 
 and now let us also assume a state of the law the state of the law is that there is no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a condition in a contract all right now on those two assumptions the next thing that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid on those assumptions is there a case or controversy under the federal constitution if not why not 
 i dont think so because i think what they are really asking for is advice about a business deal under those circumstances 
 but he says by the way if i win i will in fact save $N billion a year in licenses 
 yes 
 i would other have to pay and the other side will or i was a thousand dollars i meant N billion okay 
 but you know but now but now can they come even before they sign the deal in other words whats 
 no now thats 
 the line 
 im not asking 
 in other words 
 your hypothetical 
 i no oh no im just saying 
 im asking 
 i think that 
 my hypothetical 
 i think the problem i think the problem is it is it leads notion that parties can simply sort of set up a even if theres not true adversity and come to court for answers to legal questions and that has 
 well isnt there 
 is something 
 true adversity i thought the assumption underlying the everybodys hypothetical is that if the patent is determined to be invalid that the license then the license agreement is also invalid is that is that right 
 i dont think so i dont think the license agreement itself is invalid it simply 
 can you can you 
 means 
 can you collect can a patentee collect license fees based on an patent that has been determined to be invalid 
 not on that patent right the license 
 it would 
 made 
 it would be pursuant to the agreement 
 if the patent has been under lear and other cases if a patent has been held to be invalid by a final decision of a court then i think it is improper for a licensee to seek to obtain 
 collective 
 royalties 
 even if 
 for that 
 the royalty agreement says you know we have a dispute about the validity of this patent we dont know we disagree and so we have entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the uncertainty but once its determined to be invalid the license fees are not collectible 
 i think that that is correct your honor under the under the current state of the law 
 one further on further wrinkle what if the contract goes the further step and says even if the patent were determined in any action to be invalid there will still be a royalty payable because thats what thats that is consideration for the fact that we are not going to start any controversy now lets assume they assume precisely the invalidity would you say the contract is unenforceable then and the and the 
 well 
 and for jurisdictional purposes there would be no case or controversy then 
 that if under the im sorry to 
 the 
 the 
 take the chief justices hypothetical add the following there is a provision in there to the effect that if during the term of this contract the license is determined to be invalid royalties will still be payable under this contract 
 uhhuh 
 because that is one of the contingencies which is a consideration for our bargain would you say in those circumstances that your answer would be the same that theres no theres no case or 
 well i dont know what the dispute would be about your honor because it sounds like the contract terms would be clear and if the contract terms are clear they would simply go in accordance unless they have an argument that the contract is 
 no but im talking about jurisdictional purposes 
 unenforceable if the if the point is that it is actually invalid illegal that that may be a different case although i think there would still be an estoppel argument that they should not be permitted to bring that action without giving up the benefits of the bargain which is the immunity from suit i mean that is one of the fundamental problems with this case 
 but do you see 
 i thought your argument im sorry 
 well if do you see a difference between i guess you are saying theres no difference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and the chief justices hypo for jurisdictional purposes 
 i dont think that theres a difference from a jurisdictional perspective 
 okay 
 but i think here that the major problem from a jurisdictional perspective is that there is not anything in the language of the contract that gives them a right to come to court to dispute validity instead we are 
 what about the fact that its under protest 
 that makes no difference your honor the fact is that they are making the payments pursuant to an agreement they are not under compulsion of an injunction they are doing it because they voluntarily entered into it altvater is completely different there there was no license agreement in force the courts found that it that the reissue patents were never part of the agreement to begin with in other words altvater never agreed to pay royalties altvater had been sued so there wasnt a counterclaim for invalidity 
 could the 
 and 
 patent holder take the position that i sooner or later im going to have to fight out validity with someone and might as well do it sooner rather than later so i am not going to raise the license as a defense would that be a case or controversy 
 i dont think that the patent holder is allowed to come to court and seek a declaration of validity i dont think any court has ever allowed that 
 is it its no the patent the licensee is coming into court and wants a declaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without the fear of an infringement suit 
 and they are under a license 
 yes 
 yes 
 and the patent holder chooses not to plead the license chooses not to plead the license wouldnt the patent holder have that option 
 yes the patent well no i mean not necessarily their view is that because of the terms of the agreement that the patent holder has no choice but to because they are receiving the royalties to simply 
 i dont mean their view i mean they start a lawsuit they say we are we want 
 but that is thats what happened here 
 we want a declaration of infringement and the patent holder doesnt take the position that you are taking instead says im prepared to fight this out now i know that i have the license which could be an affirmative defense but im not going to raise it im going to go head to head on the validity of this patent would that be a case or controversy 
 i dont think so your honor because i dont think the parties are allowed to just decide well wed like to do this now when they are 
 so even 
 they have treated 
 even if the patent holder chooses not to raise the license the court would have to on its own motion say sorry you didnt you are not the master of your defense we decide that you have to effectively plead the license 
 i think the plaintiff has to show that they are here pursuant to that they have a legal right that permits them to adjudicate the issue of validity what the what the patent owner does or not i dont think turns this into a case or controversy that instead we have to start with the fundamental question what is the cause of action that they are attempting to adjudicate is it a contract action or is it a an action under the patent laws is it an infringement action here i dont think theres any question but that it is they are trying to adjudicate an action for an infringement that cant arise because they are immune from suit because they continue to make their payments and under those circumstances it is not sufficiently immediate to establish jurisdiction in 
 it is 
 this court 
 it is under other fields of the law isnt it i mean i imagine that the very we see all the time declaratory judgments where a state passes a law and the individual says well i think this is unconstitutional but my preferences are not to go to jail my preferences are not to be penalized so my first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey it theres no possibility in the world that he will violate that law and yet we have often held that with regulations you have to have the other requirements you have to have the requirements that its concrete its not just ideological theres real harm but if those other requirements that are fulfilled i have never seen any where it said that there also has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment i have just never found that phrase and i cant imagine why it would be part of the law 
 your honor poe versus ullman this court actually dismissed a declaratory judgment 
 oh there are many dismissed for the reasons that they arent concrete definite there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it im just wondering if there is an additional reason that there has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment action its that phrase that i have never found anywhere 
 we 
 and cant think of any reason why that would be an additional constitutional requirement and im putting that directly to you because i want to hear you give me the counterexamples 
 well but in poe versus ullman it was a declaratory judgment action they were seeking to have a statute declared unconstitutional and this court did dismiss because they didnt have a reasonable fear that they would actually be prosecuted dismissed for lack of jurisdiction 
 and you say there has never been a declaratory judgment action except in the instance where in the absence of the action the person would have violated the law if its a government law in other words if they are so its really not 
 even 
 yes 
 well you could you could im not it is possible that that framework could be extended i it has not been done to date and it would be 
 as i think as we 
 but 
 both know 
 but 
 in the government area it happens 
 it 
 a lot 
 it does 
 yes 
 but there is always a reasonable apprehension and there was always a finding of coercion poe versus ullman says you cant do it unless there is 
 do i remember that 
 well poe versus ullman was a case in which even if there was a violation of the law there was going to be no prosecution 
 thats why they didnt 
 he but in this in this case if theres a failure to of conform to the terms of the license agreement theres going to be a lawsuit so i think poe versus ullman is just not relevant 
 that it goes to the next point which is that there still has to be a coercive choice you have to choose there they are choosing to give up constitutional rights in order to avoid jail and imprisonment arrest and prosecution here 
 no but 
 whats at issue 
 but in poe versus ullman the ultimate action was basically like violating the contract here and thats why its not an applicable precedent 
 i dont i dont think its like violating the contract here though your honor because what are the consequences here what is the choice first of all they actually owe the royalties under the agreement so they are trying to escape their bargain not enforce it thats number one so they are not forfeiting any rights under the contract they are simply trying to get out of the contract number two the consequences here the choice they are talking about isnt in the nature of coercion again they are not being arrested or prosecuted all they are going to do if they walk out of this agreement if they stop paying royalties yes they may well be sued for infringement but if they do all they face is the loss of their discount 
 but your argument seems 
 thats 
 to be based on their having implicitly given up their right to sue isnt that right that was your main argument this is a settlement this is in the nature of the settlement as part of the bargain the patent holder promises not to sue for infringement 
 its not based on them giving up their right to sue in the sense that all they have to do is stop paying royalties and they can sue they have to 
 but in answer to the hypotheticals you seem to say it wouldnt matter if they explicitly did not give up their right to sue so what is left of this argument that whats involved here is essentially a settlement 
 well it is in the nature of a compromise your honor and theres nothing in this agreement that gives them a right to sue they have to find some legal right what they are really saying what their argument has always been is that lear actually creates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue at any time of their choosing thats been their argument from the beginning 
 well their concrete right is as i thought you conceded earlier that if the patent is declared invalid they will not owe license fees 
 thats true but thats getting the cart before the horse what this court said in 
 well thats what 
 us v harvey steel is 
 a declaratory judgment action does though isnt it 
 well i dont think so your honor i think every single contract case in the lower courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a contract prior to breach there was a genuine dispute about the interpretation of the terms here what they are trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of the contract they are trying to adjudicate an infringement action and then say aha see what i have i have a judgment that the patents invalid and so now id like to say that i dont have to pay royalties under my contract 
 ms mahoney the patent bar is sort of specialized more than sort of its a specialized bar and i have never i have never been a part of it do you agree with the statement of the petitioners counsel that genprobe came as a as a shock to the 
 as a i do not agree that it came as a shock and in fact i think that warner jenkinson which is a second circuit case that allowed this kind of action back in the N s was one of the only cases ever that allowed it and other reasons were found to dismiss similar kinds of claims in genprobe it was a surprise that a licensee could do this it the law by the time that this license was executed in the federal circuit there was a case called shell oil where the court specifically held that a licensee cannot take advantage of the protections of lear until it has repudiated the license stopped paying and said that it wants to challenge validity so that was the background rule that was in force at the time of this license and then when you couple that with the fact that 
 but that wasnt the district court in this very case seemed to say i think this suit should go forward but theres genprobe and i must follow genprobe the district court at least as i read it seemed to think that genprobe moved in a different direction from where the federal circuit was before 
 in all of the prior federal circuit cases the licensee had stopped paying royalties and what the court explained in genprobe is that that is the sine qua non that a licensee cant establish jurisdiction and it cant establish a right to challenge validity if its still paying royalties 
 ms mahoney you argue in the alternative that we should dismiss it on the basis of equitable considerations under the declaratory judgment act we cant reach that argument unless we rule against you on the article iii question is that right 
 i dont think so your honor i think you can because i think that you can do it as an alternative threshold prudential jurisdictional dismissal in the nature 
 we would have to be assuming that we had jurisdiction wouldnt we 
 i think that 
 under article iii 
 i think that a prudential dismissal under article iii would also be fine and that steel co would allow for that kind of dismissal because wilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction at the front end on prudential grounds if you know that there would not be relief allowed at the back end and i think that theres no need for a remand to do this we are really talking about an equitable rule that has governed equitable actions for N years it is a 
 but what but jurisdiction is a question of power does the court have the power to do this a discretion question is different its we have the power to entertain this case but as a matter of equity we are not going to do so the power question i think is a one thats its either yes or no either the court has the power or doesnt 
 but i dont think that the court has to answer that question in order to dismiss on a prudential ground a prudential jurisdictional ground and nor is there a need for a remand in samuels versus mackell and in cardinal for instance those are cases where the court adopted prudential rules and went ahead and applied them without remand i and no remands necessary the federal circuit has already looked at this they 
 ms mahoney can i ask you one question before your light goes off i know its not goes to the case or controversy issue but in your view was the bringing of this action a material breach of an implied condition of the contract that would justify a termination of a license 
 it would depend on whether there is an implied covenant your honor it wasnt 
 im asking you whether 
 argued below 
 you think there was 
 i think it it may well be but i dont think the answer in this case turns on it because i think they have to have their own right to bring the action whether its a breach or not and that they dont because they dont have an implied right of action under lear they dont have a right to bring this action and that is an essential component of their ability to challenge the issue of validity so i think thats the first and fundamental 
 well if thats so and its a superviolation of an implied covenant and i guess you could get damages 
 i think that their theory your honor is that a licensee can do this at any time and that 
 but i think that your theory is that its a superviolation of an implied covenant 
 your honor i dont think whether its an implied covenant or not 
 not only did we agree to it but we you cant even do it if you agree to it 
 i think that an additional factor that bears on this analysis is also the fact that congress has never created an implied right of has never created a right of action thank you your honor 
 thank you ms mahoney mr kester you have N minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice just several quick items i think i think mr chief justice you were a while ago putting the horse in front of the cart which was right where it belongs the contract claim is clear in the record its at page N of the joint appendix i dont think more needs to be said about it harvey steel on which respondents rely was of course overruled 
 wait wait before you leave that do you agree that it was not raised below 
 no we dont 
 where can you tell us where it was raised below 
 well it its raised in the in the first remanded complaint its been a its been here throughout if it if it even matters i mean we wouldnt concede that that that that would even matter 
 but was it raised before the federal circuit 
 yes the whole record was you mean was it argued 
 yes 
 i believe it was id have to go back and you mean in terms of the oral argument it was certainly in the briefs it was certainly not waived there was never of course any anything in the license or anyplace else where petitioner gave up the right to sue petitioner doesnt need permission in the license to sue and as for the shock in the lower courts when this case was decided i would call to your attention what the federal circuit in N itself said and it quoted the warnerjenkinson case which was the second circuit case that my friend dismissed somewhat the cr bard case this is federal circuit early starts out the opening line it says and i quote this is N fN d N we hold that a patent license need not be terminated before a patent licensee may bring a federal declaratory judgment action close quote and the last words of the same opinion at N of N fN d are we hold that a patent licensee may bring a federal declaratory judgment action to declare the federal to declare the patent subject to the license invalid without prior termination of the of the license that was N genprobe was N something happened in the interval finally the discussion of settlements here strikes me as indeed strange because if this if a license were to be redesignated as a settlement we would have the situation here where a license was signed in N the only patent at issue in this case was not even issued until N 
 thank you mr kester 
 thank you mr 
 the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first in N cunningham versus california mr gold 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the procedure for imposing aggravated sentences under californias determinate sentencing law implicates the bright line rule this court set forth in blakely and apprendi any fact other than the fact of a prior conviction which increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the primary point of contention in this case is what constitutes the statutory maximum under californias determinate sentencing law petitioner believes that its the middle term whereas respondent maintains that its the upper term in fact this case really boils down to just one question can a judge in california legally impose an upper term sentence based solely on the facts reflected in the jurys verdict or the defendants admissions the answer to this question is no californias determinate sentencing law specifies three possible prison terms for each for each felony conviction a lower term a middle term and an upper term although it mandates that judges shall impose the middle term unless there are factors of aggravation or mitigation california case law confirms that judges must impose the middle term where there are no aggravating factors and even the state appears to concede the point because the middle term is the greatest punishment a judge can impose based solely on the facts reflected in the jurys verdict it and not the upper term constitutes the statutory maximum for 
 mr gold i know you take that position on the facts of this case but is it not true that there could be cases in which the verdict of the jury would establish certain facts that would justify going beyond the middle term for example the black case itself as the justice who dissented in this case thought the sentence was permissible in that case 
 your honor justice stevens to the extent that a fact is found by the jury which can be used as an aggravating factor but is not an element of the crime or found by the jury as an enhancement that could be used to impose an upper term sentence yes 
 would it always then be surplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and subsequently found by a jury is it always a surplus fact because otherwise i mean what im getting at is otherwise one assumes it would be a way of stating an element of the offense and as i understand it under california law the element of the offense couldnt satisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the higher range 
 yes your honor i mean typically under california law in the information they allege the crime and on occasion some of the elements but typically not all of the elements 
 if in this case the indictment had charged had claimed that the defendant was the father of the victim would that have satisfied at least the factfinding for the aggravator of being in a position of trust 
 well your honor the fact that the information would have alleged that does not mean that the jury would have found that fact because just because what is alleged in the indictment or in the information 
 that depends on the instructions 
 yes 
 if the instructions said you know you have got to find all of the things that are set out in the information and the jury returned a verdict then we would have found and that would satisfy the requirement of an additional fact on an element 
 i believe so justice souter 
 that would be an erroneous instruction i assume 
 yes justice scalia 
 you either have to have an erroneous instruction or a special verdict 
 yes 
 only in the sense that it would require the state to prove more than it had to prove for the elements of the crime 
 right 
 yes justice souter and i agree that it would be no different than submitting aggravating factors as a separate allegation to the jury as a separate instruction 
 counsel the thing that concerns me about your case is that californias system looks a lot like the federal system after booker we havent addressed the issue or had a case involving review of reasonableness for upward departure but at least as the circuits have said it in a federal case the district judge imposes a maximum doesnt give any reason for departing from what the guidelines might suggest is a reasonable middle ground he may be i think in most circuits that would be reversed same here if a california judge imposes the upper tier but doesnt make any findings thats going to be reversed but if a federal judge gives a statement of his reasons you know a vulnerable victim or an offender likely to offend again whatever under most circuit law thats going to be upheld here if the california judge does that thats going to be still struck down under your view you talked about blakely and apprendi but how does this system look to you under booker 
 well your honor this system really is this is just like this case is just like blakely what the california supreme court in people against black found they used references to reasonableness as a label and a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of blakely and apprendi instead they tried to fit the determinate sentencing law within the federal system this court found constitutional in booker but the california supreme court seriously misread booker in booker in the remedial portion of that decision this court found the federal system to be constitutional by rendering the guidelines the mandatory guidelines to be advisory now 
 under california they are advisory anyway i mean even if the judge makes the necessary finding to get up into the higher tier he doesnt have to impose the higher sentence he can impose the lower one 
 mr chief justice no he has to impose the middle term he cant deviate 
 my point is if he makes a finding that justifies going up to the higher term N years in this case he doesnt have to impose that higher term he can go back to the middle term 
 no no you are absolutely right he has discretion not to do that 
 but does it say that the only basis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is that the judge has found a fact that the jury didnt find 
 yes 
 it does say that as i read the california opinion they can go up above the lower the middle term for any reason but it has to be reasonable 
 your honor what this what the california supreme court did in this 
 maybe thats hard to justify in terms of californias statute but we take the california supreme courts interpretation of that statute as the law of california so what is the answer to my question as you read black 
 the answer to your question is that black has made no change whatsoever to the mandatory nature of californias determinate sentencing law and it has always operated in a mandatory way 
 i think let me give you 
 i think your answer would be that how could it possibly be reasonable except for the consideration of some additional fact what makes it reasonable other than facts atmosphere i mean 
 if that is your answer my example will be i will give you a specific example one example is the question of consecutive versus concurrent sentences which may have very little to do with facts a second example might be that a judge in a particular community says theres been an unbelievable rash of breaking and entering i see how the writers of this guideline of the statute that embodies it thought that breaking and entering was x occurred with x frequency but we have in this community a sudden rash of crime such that i think the reasonable thing to do is to increase the sentence as a deterrent now suppose thats what he writes and is there anything in california law as you understand black that makes that unlawful 
 yes your honor 
 what 
 i believe that the statements in black 
 which statements make that unlawful 
 your honor in black the california supreme court repeatedly stated that the way the system works in california is that it is a mandatory system so as an example at N calN th N the court stated the court cannot impose the upper term unless there is at least one aggravating factor at N the court said in a case in which no aggravating factor can be found the judge cannot impose the upper term there are a number of statements throughout the black opinion that indicate the system has never changed from a mandatory one to an advisory one so that reasonableness is not the issue whether the system is mandatory or advisory 
 so in other words when they say mandatory factor they mean aggravating factor they mean to exclude the kind of aggravating factor i just mentioned 
 well a judge can consider those aggravating factors 
 oh could he could the judge consider the fact that i just mentioned that theres been an extraordinary rash of breaking and entering in the vicinity 
 well your honor 
 yes or no 
 well under californias law they have in addition to factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant the judge can consider unenumerated factors 
 unenumerated factors so mine would be an unenumerated factor 
 yes 
 all right if he can consider unenumerated factors now i purposely picked mine because i take it it is an example of a factor that apprendi would not require a jury to find it is a factor about the community it is not a factor about this defendant it is not a factor about the manner in which this defendant committed the crime it is not a fact of that kind 
 your honor im not sure whether that sort of factor would be upheld as a 
 but if it were reasonable it would be upheld or not 
 if it was found to be a decision that was reasonably related to the crime im sorry to the decision being made by the judge then yes it would be upheld as a valid aggravating factor but i believe that it would still need to be then if it would be considered a valid aggravating factor then it would need to be tried by the jury 
 may i clarify one thing you mean that a rash of crimes committed by people other than the defendant could be an aggravating factor 
 your honor under california law im not saying that that would be upheld as a valid reason im just 
 but theres nothing in california law suggesting that that would be upheld is there 
 no justice stevens there is not 
 so you draw as i understand it your basic answer to justice breyer is it may well be that the situation in the community may justify a judge in going to the to the high end of the range that is possible but that is not a factor that determines what range is possible and the fact that determines what range is possible is an aggravating fact and in that respect it is different from the federal system is that 
 thats absolutely right justice souter 
 i didnt understand it if he does tell me again would you i thought your response was going to be what justice who suggested it 
 somebody on that side suggested it that to talk about the fact that theres a lot of crime in the community as an aggravating factor doesnt make any sense aggravating factor means something that makes the crime that this person committed worse not the need for punishment greater but makes the crime worse now if that is not your answer what is the answer that you gathered from the left of me 
 well with all due respect to justice breyer i believe that that probably would not be an aggravating factor that would be upheld under california law i was just trying to make the distinction between whether an aggravating factor no matter what it is whether it is considered reasonable whether thats enough to get the judge to go beyond the statutory maximum but 
 i thought your position was that aggravation must be reasonable what the court in black indicates is that it is not going to consider anything reasonable unless theres a fact to support it unless theres a finding of fact to support it is that the position you take 
 the position as far as what black is saying 
 yes 
 yes i think black what black is saying is that an aggravating factor needs to be reasonable but i was trying to make the distinction 
 but i think that theres the further indication that it is not going to be deemed reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact as indicated in order to support one of the specific guideline aggravators 
 certainly if the aggravating factor is not supported by the evidence then it wont be considered reasonable and the imposition of a upper term wont be considered reasonable but 
 i still dont understand the distinction between the california system and a system of advisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review lets take a hypothetical case where the statutory range after convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred years and lets say you have two judges who have these cases and one sentences the defendant to zero probation the other one sentences the defendant to a hundred years without saying a word of explanation for either sentence isnt the appellate court in that situation going to say you have to tell us why you have chosen zero or why you have chosen N and if the trial judge provides an explanation isnt the trial judge necessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the judge believes to be true about the offense and the offender 
 your honor if you are describing the federal system or just a hypothetical system my understanding in a indeterminate type of system a judge can impose whatever sentence he wants and whether or not in a particular system that will be reviewed for reasonableness is a separate question as to what he 
 but isnt it reviewed for reasonableness isnt the reasonableness review necessarily going to require what is in essence factfinding by the trial judge and a review of the reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by an appellate court 
 yes your honor but what in booker what made the federal system constitutional was not the engraftment of the reasonableness review it was rendering the mandatory guidelines advisory and thats the aspect of californias supreme court black decision that they have misread the booker decision 
 why is that why is that so why isnt the middle sentence just like what the guideline what the guideline would indicate and if a federal court would say if i sentence within the guideline that will be presumptively valid as many courts have held not this court yet that would be presumptively valid and if i go outside i have to give a reason that will survive appellate review well why isnt the middle sentence identical in function to the federal sentencing guidelines advice 
 justice ginsburg i think that its the mandatory nature in california of the middle term the judge cannot exceed the middle term unless he finds at least one aggravating factor and my understanding in the federal system is that the judge can exceed the can exceed these guideline ranges and that they are just advisory 
 to say that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable so under the federal system it is perfectly possible unless unless we hold otherwise for a judge to give a sentence beyond the guideline range and nonetheless to be affirmed because although the guideline range is reasonable there are other systems that would be reasonable right 
 yes your justice scalia and i think that to the extent that we are going to say that any sentence outside this guideline range is going to be unreasonable and necessarily require reversal is going to be no different than the mandatory guideline system this court struck down in booker itself 
 so the only part of the california system that creates a problem is this the one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall impose the middle term unless he makes a finding 
 thats absolutely right 
 so that if we rule in your favor the great benefit for criminal defendants in california will be that judges can now depart without making a particular finding they can increase the sentence even though they do not find an aggravator within the limits of the california system 
 but mr chief justice it is not clear that that would be the result in california the legislature could very well 
 doesnt the decision in black suggest the supreme court thinks that would be the result the california supreme court 
 im not sure that they think that that would be the result they certainly did not make an attempt to reform or rewrite the statute so that it was now an advisory system 
 i thought that it looked to me thats what they were trying to do in black i mean in a way it is kind of the the black opinion the day after if this court were to agree with you and the california supreme court issued a decision looking a lot like its decision in black that would be perfectly valid in other words saying that judges can depart within this whole just like booker they can depart within this whole range and we are going to review their determinations for reasonableness they dont have to impose the middle sentence they can impose a higher sentence and we will review it for reasonableness that would be perfectly all right 
 well and that may very well be the case but thats not what the california supreme court did in black they made no attempt what they did was described the determinate sentencing law as it has always operated and at no time did they purport to change the law in california including the mandatory nature of the determinate sentencing law 
 but what they said was judges can impose a sentence in either of the three any one of the three tiers and we are going to review it for reasonableness and if they dont make findings it is going to be unreasonable right 
 yes but once again the reasonableness aspect is not what makes the system constitutional it is the mandatory versus advisory aspect and again thats what made the federal system constitutional based on this courts booker decision it wasnt this engraftment of reason reviewing these sentences for reasonableness 
 well to be quite to expose my thinking on it i found it rather ambiguous pages N and N is that what the first part of that is it says what you said i have no doubt it says just what you said but then you get over to the part the discussion of booker and when they start talking about booker they seem to say seem to say that they are adopting what booker says now if they are adopting what booker says that means and thats why i used my example that i guess a judge would have the power if it is reasonable to just say the guideline though it says thus and so isnt right for my circumstance and therefore i dont adopt it and that would be reviewed for reasonableness his decision not to follow it and similarly we have cases for example where they are trying to construct a sentence and they cant get it right because of the consecutive or concurrent nature so he adds a few things on you see to the sentence in order and then makes them concurrent or you could have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy and the jury found the conspiracy it is a characterization of a conspiracy it is very sophisticated and i thought well maybe all three of those are reasons for going up in california and i read those pages N N and my honest opinion is im not sure 
 well your honor i have no doubt that the california supreme court was trying to fit the determinate sentencing law within the constitutionality of this courts booker system but as far as N im looking every single time they talk about booker or reasonableness they also make sure to give the to make sure that they make clear that the way the sentence the system works is that theres still this requirement of finding an aggravating factor 
 an aggravating factor means aggravating fact 
 aggravating fact uh yes 
 what would you think would be necessary what would be the least change california would have to make to bring its system into compliance with our decisions 
 justice ginsburg the court could the court or the legislature could change section N to read something like a judge may impose instead of shall impose the middle term and that would be valid to the extent that what they mean by may is they can now impose the middle term based just on the facts found by the jury 
 or they could say the middle term will always be reasonable couldnt they say that 
 they could and in effect they do say that 
 even though there is the possibility that something above the middle term would also be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete fact beyond the indictment to justify it right 
 yes there are 
 the protection that criminal defendants now have that they cannot be sentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes particular findings will then be no longer applicable 
 yes your honor i and i 
 thats true unless the california legislature does what most states have done in response to booker which is not that route at all they did maintain their determinate sentencing but they just required the jury finding thats what i think seven out of nine states have done 
 yes justice stevens and that was the point i was going to make that that is a very likely outcome given what the majority of other states have done and that mr chief justice would be a 
 so that now the defendant will have the protection of his jury determining his guilt will not only have to know the evidence of his guilt of the crime but also know why hes likely to reoffend in the future things like he used a firearm all the bad things that will increase his sentence and might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the first place 
 not necessarily your honor because for those type of prejudicial factors california is wellpositioned to handle those because they do so anyway in bifurcated proceedings there are often enhancement allegations that relate to recidivism or even gang allegations anything thats prejudicial are handled at a separate proceeding after trial 
 and are there a half a dozen jury trials in each for each of those various aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the jury 
 no your honor what im trying to say is that basically california does that anyway now most of the factors that relate to the defendant have to do with recidivism and those are the same kind of factors that are alleged in the information and are tried in a bifurcated proceeding to the jury or are waived and then the trial court will consider them 
 thats interesting are there in fact whats your estimate guess as to how many criminal jurytried cases in california what percent have two juries have more than one jury 
 they dont have more than one jury they are tried to the same jury but they are tried after the 
 in what percentage would you say they have bifurcated or several jury trials i mean more than just one 
 your honor i would say that there are lots of cases where they are tried to a court the defendant will waive them if they are based on recidivism 
 no no but how many how many times do they let me call it impaneling the jury twice or two juries or it could be the same one 
 the same 
 yes what percentage would you guess just make a rough roughest conceivable guess 
 completely anecdotally i would say N percent i if i would like to reserve the remainder of my time 
 thank you mr gold mr laurence 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the central lesson from booker from the real portion of booker is that not every constraint thats placed on a trial courts discretion in selecting a term within a range that requires factfinding invokes the sixth amendment requirement of a jury trial a reasonableness constraint that requires the court to consider all the circumstances of the defendant and select a reasonable sentence in relation to those facts and those factors does not invoke the sixth amendment jury trial right california has consistently construed its system as placing nothing more than a reasonableness constraint on the trial courts discretion in selecting among the 
 thats not so at all california says if you go over the middle range it is unreasonable period unless you prove or you find one of the aggravating factors thats a constraint you cannot go above the middle range 
 yes your honor but thats the same constraint that this court found not above the constitution in booker 
 no thats not what we found in booker we found in booker or at least the way the lower federal courts have been interpreting booker if you use the guideline range and you are within the guideline range that is automatically reasonable you dont have to worry about it but we havent held and i dont believe most of the federal courts have held that if you go beyond the guideline range it is automatically unreasonable and that is the case with the california system if you go beyond the middle range it is automatically unreasonable unless you unless you find one of the aggravating facts 
 your honor id have to respectfully disagree with that because we are not talking about a middle range what we are talking about is an end point if i can use the booker example where you have a term of N years to life the court can certainly make a selection within a reasonable range at some point as the court increases its sentence beyond a certain point it will become unreasonable we dont need to identify specifically what that point is the guideline range or something close to it but when you get to the end point if theres no justification offered whatsoever for a life term 
 but the difference is in the federal system the judge can go above and it can be reasonable based on facts that were found by the jury but in california to go beyond the middle range up to the upper range it must be a fact not found by the jury 
 well your honor 
 is that not correct 
 thats only correct because california has a discrete threeterm sentence 
 correct but whatever the reason it is correct 
 it is correct your honor but the central point of both booker and california is that that upper term is being reversed not because its unauthorized but because its unreasonable 
 on one hand in one case the unreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by the jury but in the federal system it does not require that finding by a jury 
 your honor if a federal judge wished to impose a life term there would have to be something to justify it or it would be reversed on appeal 
 it wouldnt necessarily be a fact it could be a fact what it says in here is that if the they speak of a circumstance related to the crime or the offender and in a case in which no such aggravating factor can be found the judge cannot impose the upper term now i grant you theres some language that i it seems to me on the next few paragraphs seems to say something a little different but that language if you just take that seems to say unless judge you find a fact about the situation that would make it reasonable to go above the middle range you cant under the law now if thats what it says i have to admit i find it a little difficult to distinguish from blakely and other cases where i dissented but the courts law is what the majority says so that seems to me almost like it unless you can tell me that im wrong in that 
 i would say you are wrong your honor simply because california has construed its sentencing law in N as imposing nothing more than a reasonableness 
 no but if as i understand it it has construed it by saying that if you go above the middle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond what has to be proven to the jury it is unreasonable as a matter of law and that unreasonableness as a matter of law feature is what distinguishes it from the federal system post booker 
 well your honor i would disagree because the upper term the statutory maximum in booker would also be necessarily unreasonable if there was no justification offered by the trial court 
 but the justification under the federal system could be you know this is what the sentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence for this crime i disagree with that now there are other authorities who think that thats a little too you know below what it ought to be he can simply disagree with the sentencing guidelines or he could point out what justice breyer suggests well the sentencing guidelines may be okay for some jurisdictions but in this jurisdiction we have a special problem with regard to this kind of a crime he can do that and doesnt have to find any special fact he cannot do that in california 
 i have two responses to that your honor first of all with regard to what the ruling in booker was the courts discretion has to be exercised in relation to the policy considerations set out in N which are the same policy considerations that the court must look at very similar in california that there are the court doesnt have unbridled discretion select any term based on whim based on whatever it feels would be whatever he decides to do on tuesday the court has to do it with regard to the policy considerations that are inherent in what the guidelines decisions were and what the legislature established should be appropriate sentencing considerations 
 but that does not necessarily mean that he must make a discrete finding of fact in order to do it we come back to justice scalias hypo a moment ago he can go you know in theory under booker he can go above the guideline range consistent with policy positions that may not be precise without necessarily making discrete findings of fact i mean youd have to judge it in each individual case but the possibility is there and under the california system the possibility is not there 
 well your honor the systems converge at the end point and that is under the federal system going to that right end point would be unreasonable in every circumstance if theres no justification offered other than he committed the offense in california because we have three discrete terms rather than a spectrum you have the same effect when you get to the end point it would be unjustified it would be an unreasonable sentence if theres no justification offered but the fact that california has three points rather than a range shouldnt be constitutionally determinative 
 and they cant be a fact in california it cant be a fact found by the jury as justice stevens pointed out thats a significant difference 
 well it cant be an element and that obviously there could be a circumstance where some special findings were made in which case that might be beyond the elements but it cant be an element simply because you shouldnt be double counting whats already established the range is set by the elements of the offense that all three terms are available from the jury verdict based on those elements if you are going to make a selection within that range it would have to be more than simply the defendant committed the offense and thats the same with the federal guidelines simply saying 
 it isnt the same in the federal guidelines under the federal guidelines the judge could say you know i think this offense is more serious than what the sentencing commission thought and these are my reasons for it there was a dissent you know the sentencing commissions determinations are reasonable but they are surely not the only reasonable disposition and it is open to a federal district judge to say well thats what they thought and i took it into account and i seriously considered it and i think they are wrong on this i think this is more serious and that could be a perfectly reasonable determination that couldnt be done in california 
 yes it could your honor and i would refer you to rule N in our appendix page N and N that the general policy considerations that over that overlay our sentencing guidelines or our sentencing system include deterrence for this defendant and deterring others from committing the same crime that you can just look to the what is happening in this particular neighborhood as the examples brought out 
 are you saying to us that under the california system if a california judge went through exactly the thought process that justice scalia just outlined and put that down on paper without finding any discrete fact beyond the elements the jury found that he could go to the third tier i really think deterrence requires the third tier not the middle tier can a california judge do that 
 yes your honor deterrence is a basis for going to the third tier 
 well thats critical and thats what i didnt understand about 
 well its not true you certainly didnt argue that way in your papers up to now i thought that there has to be a finding of some aggravating factor not simply i think deterrence is more than what the statute says or deterrence requires more than what the statute says is that really your position that if a judge thinks deterrence requires more than the middle range for that reason alone he can say i ignore the middle range 
 well thats part of the rules of court under N yes your honor 
 where 
 that would be 
 its appendix page N in the brief 
 page N and N 
 im not sure that thats the way the black court interpreted it the black court talked about a requirement that the upperterm sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists 
 yes your honor that would be considered an aggravating factor to use deterrence for this particular case 
 what do i do here because the sentence i read to you seems to say the opposite but then two sentences on they list the federal judge is not bound by the guidelines he must consult the guidelines and after they say an aggravating california it says the discretion available the in california law that may include any fact that the judge reasonably determines to be relevant the determinate sentencing law about an upper term is comparable to bookers requirement that a federal judges sentencing decision not be unreasonable well i assumed until this minute that the first statement trumped the second but now when i see the court rule certainly that court rule is possible given that to be read as permitting them particularly with the second statement you could read the second statement as saying yes they can say a particular instance or a kind of sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is in this community so contrary to the purposes of punishment that im giving a higher one to be honest i dont know what black means 
 im sorry before you could you tell me where the court rule you are talking about is set out 
 its in our appendix page the appendix to our brief im sorry the appendix to our brief page N and N 
 you say in your brief which doesnt seem to me to comport with what you are saying here for a judge to exceed the base range for example by applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing scheme the predicate fact for the enhancement or alternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt theres no indication there that the judge could just say i think more deterrence is necessary and therefore im going to exceed the base range thats just totally incompatible with that 
 your honor thats to exceed the base range to go beyond the three terms if you want to impose an enhancement for gun use or for an enhancement such as in apprendi not for selecting a term within the base range 
 all right but even for selecting a term within the base range im going to read now from rule N part says circumstances in aggravation and mitigation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence thats not the way we refer to judges reasoning about policy thats the way we refer to proof of fact and i dont see how under subsection your answer to me can be correct 
 well your honor i think the rules of court are viewed as a whole with N which talks about anything in addition to that the rules of the examples set out are not exclusive and not determinant that anything can be a consideration 
 well but they have to be an aggravating factor 
 yes 
 and to talk about the need for more deterrence as an aggravating factor thats not an aggravating factor 
 well your honor i think that the example that was given was in relation to the community that was experiencing some uptick in crime 
 thats not an aggravating factor its a basis for imposing a harsher sentence but it doesnt aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime committed by other individuals its not an aggravating factor 
 well your honor the importance of our position the central thrust of our position is that the reasonableness constraint the constraint imposed under N has been interpreted as a reasonableness constraint it doesnt matter if factors are required 
 well it can be a reasonableness constraint and also be a reasonableness restraint that requires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness the two are not exclusive 
 thats true your honor thats true 
 and the rule seems to conflate seems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete fact and it seems to me that we have got to consider the rule in responding to the ambiguity that justice breyer referred to a moment ago the ambiguity has got to be read in light of subsection and subsection seems to answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the evidence that means a fact finding 
 well let me explain it this way your honor that it doesnt matter from our perspective whether or not there is a factor required in order to say that something is that the end point is reasonable or if you are taking deterrence into account that thats not its not necessary for our argument because our position is that even if a factor is required 
 so do you think under subsection of rule N if a judge said i just think the policy of deterrence requires something heavier you think that statement by the judge would satisfy the requirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence 
 no your honor i dont 
 all right then it seems to me that you cannot hold your position consistently with the state rule of court 
 well your honor i would refer back to black at N which is the important part 
 is black repealing the rule of court i mean black if we refer back to black we get the ambiguity that justice breyer has raised in order to solve the ambiguity we look to the court rule 
 yes 
 under the court rule you admit that a judges policy consideration however sincerely held could not satisfy the requirement to prove aggravation by a preponderance isnt that the end of the issue i mean if california wants to amend its rules or its statute thats californias business but we cant do it 
 well no your honor but california has construed N as not requiring a factfinding to move from the middle term to the upper term its simply saying that when the court selects between the three the decision must be reasonable 
 then why didnt you give a different answer to my question why didnt you say if it is reasonable for the court to conclude that deterrence really requires something tougher than the middle term thats enough why didnt you say that is enough and wouldnt preclude it 
 well your honor i think that my answer would have to be that in relation to the hypothetical given i was answering it because with regards to the circumstances of the community that the defendant committed the crime in if we take that away 
 okay lets the judge the judge is on the bench he says theres too much crime in our community look at these statistics i believe that deterrence requires something heavier than the middle tier nothing unusual about this particular crime im making a policy decision about what the law should require in general would that satisfy part of N 
 yes i believe it would 
 that would satisfy the requirement of as it puts it establishing by a preponderance of the evidence 
 uhhuh yes 
 that was not what i understood california law to be or your position to be until this moment 
 well your honor i have not been suggesting that that single factor is what makes californias law constitutional what makes californias law constitutional is the fact that the constraint imposed on the courts discretion in selecting terms is a reasonableness requirement just like booker 
 reasonably that does not answer the problem 
 i think the california supreme court and the california legislature would be astounded to think that this is what they have wrought they obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the judge would apply the middle range not using his own perception as to whether more punishment is justified or not unless theres some circumstances about this crime that make this person more guilty and thats what you usually mean by aggravating circumstances not the fact that you believe the crime should bear in general should bear a higher penalty i think they would be astounded to find that this is what they have created 
 your honor let me take a step back then and say that even with the requirement that there be some factor putting aside deterrence as a possibility californias system as structured which only requires a reasonableness constraint does not violate the constitution and the reason being because all its saying is that if you are going to the absolute maximum the farthest point on the spectrum available if theres no justification offered it will be reversed as unreasonable not as unavailable 
 thats the whole problem with your case 
 certainly 
 that theres and incidentally under the rules under N those are general objectives of sentencing 
 yes your honor 
 and that is a term of art thats different from circumstances 
 yes your honor 
 so its only the circumstances that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence the general objectives can still be considered 
 yes your honor 
 but what we are involved with in this case and with this criminal whose conviction and sentence we are reviewing here are circumstances that aggravate and these do require findings 
 yes your honor 
 if those findings arent there its not reasonable 
 that is correct your honor lets just take it a step back and say that what we are talking about is even if there are circumstances that are required even if there are some justifications that the court must find aggravating factors still the only constraint is reasonableness and let me quote from what black said about N how its been construed not from the facial language but how its been construed and what black says is on page N that although subdivision is worded in mandatory language the requirement that an aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the decision to impose the upper term be reasonable 
 so what we have now this has clarified it but i dont know what to do i think if i read the opinion the way you are saying i would say the california court which is a good court conscientious managing a huge system of criminal law in the state probably bigger than the federal system reads blakely and they see that those guidelines in california as previously understood were violated and they are thinking how do we maintain this system as constitutional and therefore they write N which can be read as saying we are bookerizing it and we come as close to booker as necessary to make it constitutional now that would be an understandable judicial reaction and i can read the opinion as saying that at which point im not certain what we are supposed to say because i have no doubt that your unease reflects the fact that prior to black in california it would have been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on grounds other than factual grounds related to the circumstances of the crime or offender but i also have no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the california system all right so now what do i do 
 well your honor i think that the one thing that seems to be giving you some difficulty is the fact that california didnt explicitly say in black we are now officially bookerizing our system and the reason for that is because california had already implicitly construed the system as making all three terms legally available based on the jury verdict alone and had simply used a reasonableness requirement and that goes back to hernandez back in N when california essentially anticipated apprendi and distinguished between making enhancements available based on the jury verdict on the elements alone versus the three the three components of the triad scheme 
 well it is the same old record we have been playing but the reasonableness requirement has to be explained further and when you explain it further you find that there must be findings by a preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances that are set out thats different from the objectives of sentencing 
 yes your honor 
 but the objectives of sentencing are not whats involved in this case 
 yes your honor and i whether or not the objectives of sentencing are involved is not the critical point of the constitutionality of this system as far as california is concerned what is important is that first of all the fact that the preponderance of the evidence requirement is essentially the same as whats involved in making discretionary findings within a range in the federal system and we are talking about the findings within a range 
 would you want us to hold that you know that we uphold the system here in an opinion that says what californias sentencing judges may do under california law as you have described it to us is that they they may exceed the middle range whenever they think that that is a better result whenever they think that thats reasonable 
 yes 
 and you think california would be happy with that 
 yes reasonableness is the touchstone of the constraint imposed upon the trial courts in selecting among the three terms and that would be a perfectly 
 well including reasonable disagreement with the level of severity that the legislature has provided in the middle term i mean other legislatures may have provided higher severity and the judge says i simply disagree with the california legislature and its a reasonable disagreement because some other legislature might have done what i do 
 no your honor 
 that isnt reasonable why isnt it reasonable 
 reasonableness has to be tied to the policy considerations that underlie the 
 he ties it to that he says i just disagree with the california legislature as to whether this is enough to prevent the defendant from committing this kind of a crime and look and he cites another state which provides a much higher sentence for the same crime can that possibly be unreasonable 
 yes your honor i believe that under the california 
 then you dont mean reasonableness you mean something else 
 may i ask you this question excluding capital cases in your view anecdotally if it has to be that what percentage of cases that go to juries that go to jury trial result in bifurcated proceedings for sentencing purposes N percent 
 i would say probably a rough guess would be around N percent thats we are dealing with 
 on that question may i ask on that subject may i ask you this question have you read the brief filed by the national association the amicus brief by the national association of defense lawyers which has a long discussion of the practical consequences in other states and in california 
 yes 
 and which i find to be honest to you rather persuasive on the fact its not such a big deal as we thought it might be and id like you to have an opportunity to tell me whether theres something in that brief that is not accurate 
 well your honor it would certainly be a big deal to california but more importantly if this court were to say that a reasonableness constraint reinvokes the sixth amendment you would be basically throwing into doubt the way booker has reformed the federal system as well because 
 they say if i remember it correctly that if the impact in a four day trial would normally be an extra hour for the jury that thats about the burden on the system and of course N some percent of your cases are pleaded out by guilty so its not the major thing that we originally thought it might be do you think just across the board are they fairly accurate in their description of what happens in other states as far as you are advised 
 as far as the other states go yes your honor and i believe the impact on california would be a requirement of a secondary trial after the main trial but it would also impose a burden of trying to identify whatever aggravating circumstances or whatever relevant considerations have to take place in this particular case which can be a multitude of things in california law essentially anything can anything can justify an upper term sentence its only when theres absolutely nothing not a scintilla of justification that an upper term becomes unreasonable and therefore reversed 
 how many cases would have to be resentenced if we were to reverse in this case 
 its my understanding that under currently in california about N percent of the prison population has an upper term so i dont know how many cases there are on a yearbyyear basis or since blakely or since apprendi but probably in the thousands possibly 
 yes you had N incarcerated when i last looked 
 yes your honor and the once again the important aspect whats the key aspect is whether or not a term is legally available and whether or not theres a constraint thats imposed that takes away that legal availability as a threshold matter rather than a reasonableness review requirement california has consistently construed N as imposing a reasonableness requirement this court in booker said that a reasonableness requirement does not limit the availability of those upper terms 
 do you know of any case in which a california trial judge has gone beyond the middle range not on the basis of a fact that that judge has found but rather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that the punishment should be greater something along the lines of what justice breyer suggested 
 no your honor im not aware of it 
 im not either and i would be astounded if any trial judge would read these statutes and court rules that way 
 once again your honor that is not the critical component of why this system is constitutional and thats not what we are advancing in our briefs its not the position that im arguing here that that is what would save californias system what saves californias system is that the only constraint imposed is a reasonableness constraint and that reasonableness constraint N has been interpreted over time as simply imposing the abuse of discretion standard on the court and that has been applied to all three terms the middle term is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion as is the lower term and what is important to note is even though the middle term the only reason the middle term has been given the label presumptive is because the court doesnt have to expressly articulate its reasons for selecting it but it still has to do a balancing to make a determination as to whats reasonable including the middle term 
 thank you mr laurence mr gold you have four minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice i want to respond to three items the first is mr chief justice you were asking about what would be the effect in california on those that have already been sentenced the only information i have was what was contained in black that only N to N percent of cases are sentenced in the upper range but what the court should also consider is that most in most cases the difference between the middle term and upper term is really only a year in this case it is four years which is somewhat unusual so in those cases a lot of the people will have already served their prison sentences by the time that they would be able to benefit from any result in this case i also wanted to echo what justice kennedy i believe was saying california rules of court rule N is just general objectives of sentencing these are not aggravating factors you cant take into account achieving uniformity of sentencing securing restitution for the victims these arent aggravating factors that the judge considers 
 well rule N says that the sentencing judge should be guided by the criteria in these rules 
 in sentencing but i dont believe as far as finding them as aggravating factors these are not facts that judges in california use to impose upperterm sentences 
 no but a reading of the rule indicates under as the chief justice points out that the judge could take into account these policy objectives 
 your honor all i can tell you is that i have never seen a judge take these into account as an aggravating factor and i would be surprised under the case law if these have been ever upheld as valid aggravating factors 
 well i think it is true that it doesnt seem to be involved in this case in this case we are under N 
 certainly yes certainly not in this case 
 we have to conclude that the california supreme court has misread california law to agree with you dont we 
 no your honor 
 i mean i see N and i understand your argument but when i read the california supreme court opinion in black it says well this is what it means it doesnt seem to be what it means but they get to interpret it dont they 
 they do get to interpret how their statutes operate your honor but i believe that they are consistent in saying that this is a mandatory system in every one of their quotes they talk about either a judge must impose the middle term unless there are aggravating factors or they talk about the requirement i was going to mention justice breyers quote from black and even in that one they say because an aggravating factor under california law may include any factor that the judge reasonably deems to be relevant and then say the determinate sentencing laws requirement that an upperterm sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists they always talk about the requirement that this aggravating factor must exist 
 so it is comparable to booker and then in the preceding four paragraphs they correctly describe booker 
 yes and we have no doubt that they are trying to fit the determinate sentence law within booker but booker is about making the magic word as it were is advisory versus mandatory not reasonableness so yes the california system is reasonable and thats what the california supreme court is talking about 
 under any guideline system whether its mandatory or advisory once if you have a mandatory system or an advisory system with appellate review once the appellate review function has been performed will it not be the case that trial judges will not have unfettered discretion will have very limited discretion in choosing making these sentencing policy determinations thats the whole purpose of a guidelines system that the individual trial judges dont get to decide you know how much deterrence they think is necessary or how severe they think an individual crime is that theres supposed to be some kind of uniformity 
 well justice alito there is discretion in our system but it is the discretion to impose an upperterm after finding aggravating factors and i think that in an indeterminate system as you were discussing earlier i think that that im not sure it depends what the system is as far as what the reasonableness constraints are 
 thank you mr gold the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument in bp america production company against the secretary mr lamken 
 thank you justice stevens and may it please the court section N established a limitations period for every action for money damages by the government which is founded on any contract that provision by its terms applies to every contract action every adversary adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach whether pursued before a court or an agency the contention that every action encompasses only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for three reasons first it is inconsistent with the broad language that congress used it is inconsistent with the statutory structure in that it renders another provision the exception for administrative offset totally superfluous it also creates an irrationality in the hierarchy of the governments claims finally it robs section N of its intended effect turning to the text congress official and agencies regularly use the term action to refer to adversary adjudications before administrative agencies and before the judiciary the term 
 what 
 denotes 
 may i ask you on that point i understand what you are saying and i have looked at your authority but right in the provision itself there is a verbal distinction made between actions for money damages and what at the end of the provision they refer to as administrative proceedings in providing for the N year supplementary rule doesnt the statute in effect say we dont mean by action what we would possibly what possibly might be included as an administrative proceeding if they had wanted an administrative proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money damages wouldnt it have been sensible for congress to say in to refer instead of to administrative proceedings to administrative actions 
 well in fact the it refers to administrative proceedings required by contract or law and that clause applies in the particular circumstance where a law or a contract requires some sort of administrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the action for money damages so if you can bring your official moneydamages action without any prior administrative proceeding regardless of where you bring 
 i think your point has to be that there are administrative proceedings that are not actions 
 that is absolutely correct nonadversarial administrative proceedings would themselves not be actions 
 right 
 and they also wouldnt be moneydamages actions so the distinction the statute draws is not between moneydamages actions in court and moneydamages actions before agencies its before moneydamages actions wherever brought and the administrative proceedings that have to be brought as a condition precedent 
 you contend that what commenced the action here was the order demanding payment 
 that is correct that is the 
 thats a very weird commencement of an action where what then follows is what is referred to as an appeal within the agency 
 for historical reasons the denominations are quite strange but for grisa quoted on subsections N and N quoted on pages N and N of official our reply brief specifically state that the order to pay commences the proceedings and so since that is the 
 which says that 
 its on page N of our brief its section N of our 
 what page of your brief 
 N and N of the reply brief 
 of the reply 
 yes and its N usc N and it talks or it defines the demand as the order to pay and then the definitional provisions in turn when they are talking about what commences the action it says that the order to pay commences the action and so 
 im not finding it where is it again 
 page N of the reply your honor very top the citation says N usc N emphasis added it defines demand to include an order to pay issued by the secretary and in the next line down we say for grisa thus recognizes that the socall order to pay far from concluding the action in fact commences it because the statute of limitations prepared uses the word commenced to describe what the action the order to pay does official 
 why is why doesnt it make much more sense as i understand the proceeding this order doesnt come out of the blue as required there has to be a letter to the to the payee saying we think we think you owe so much money he is allowed to respond right 
 that 
 and then after considering the response the order issues now i would consider that a you know an that sounds to me like a complaint and an opportunity to respond to it and then finally the first decision of the agency which is then appealed and cfr provides for an what he calls an appeal and it seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the opinion on the appeal 
 in fact that process which isnt even mentioned in the regulations doesnt have any legal operative effect its more like a demand letter if the lessee doesnt respond to the letter he doesnt waive any of his rights if the government fails to include a claim in its demand letter in the well in the audit letter it doesnt waive any of its rights the 
 well it doesnt 
 first document 
 waive it but it cant issue official the order without having issued the letter first giving 
 i 
 giving the party an opportunity to say why this amount isnt owed 
 well in fact theres nothing in the regulations and i think the solicitor general would concede that actually requires this informal process it happens to be typically done and the sg uses the word typically in the brief but theres nothing that requires it and if you dont respond there are no consequences to failure to respond 
 is there anything that requires the order 
 the anything that requires the secretary to proceed by order 
 yes 
 that is the secretarys traditional way of doing things 
 well 
 yes but 
 so you could say the same for the other 
 oh but it but there is no liability if the order fails to issue the order if it were the first salvo you still would be required to official respond and so your failure to respond is very much a default the failure to respond to the letter the audit letter has no legal operative effect 
 you dont you dont but you dont respond to the order you take an appeal from the order 
 thats correct you file a 
 it seems to me crazy to call that order a complaint i even if i grant your other argument that an administrative proceeding can be commenced by a complaint or that the term complaint can apply to administrative proceedings i dont think that what you have hung your hat on here namely the order seems to me to fit that description 
 well justice scalia it is the first document which is recognized in the regulations which provides the lessor of the notice of claims against it the first one thats required by the regulations in order to commence the proceedings 
 you mean 
 its recognized 
 the regulations dont refer to the initial letter 
 no they dont the regulations dont require this informal process its typically done official 
 so they literally could start absolutely out of the blue by issuing the order 
 i think thats correct that is the way that it could be done theres an informal process thats typically followed but you could ignore it and theres no legal operative effect so that 
 i doubt whether 
 informal process 
 that would 
 cant be a complaint 
 i doubt whether that would conform with the administrative procedure act i mean either even at the first level of agency decision 
 well 
 it seems to me you have to give the individual an opportunity to reply 
 well that is perhaps why the agency tries this to do the informal process but in fact it does not have legal operative effect there you could completely ignore that initial demand letter and say sorry agency im not responding the agency then files its order and thats the first time you must register your defenses upon failure or forfeiture 
 of course you can ignore it official that doesnt prove anything you could ignore an agency complaint too 
 right 
 i mean a formal complaint in which case you will be found liable what does 
 thats the 
 the fact that you dont have to respond have to do with anything 
 the legal consequences its exactly right justice scalia if you dont respond to the demand letter there are no legal consequences if you dont respond to the letter by filing whats called an appeal you lose and so its just like a complaint you default if you fail to raise your defenses at that point in addition section N 
 and its also i assume true that the demand letter would not toll a statute 
 no we dont believe a demand letter would toll a statute because its not required by 
 well you 
 by law 
 youd win in this case even if it did i dont think that the difference between the initial letter giving you an opportunity to reply and the official what you call the complaint the order that time period doesnt put you out of out of the permissible period 
 oh i certainly hope 
 right 
 hope not 
 yes 
 but in fact section N which is on page N and N of the appendix to our brief makes it clear that whether something is denominated a complaint or not does not determine whether or not its covered by the limitations period N is an exception for counterclaims and offsets by the government where a private party brings an action against the government but counterclaims and offsets typically arent brought by complaint they are brought in the answer they are submitted in the answer therefore whether its denominated an order an answer or something else doesnt control whether or not N applies N applies to any action for money damages founded on a contract however you might denominate the initial filing which commences the proceedings in 
 mr lamken the point has been made that there are many indications that what congress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court official in addition to finding this provision solely in title N the judiciary code and not in title N theres also if you read the following provision N time for commencing actions brought by the united states and then it tells us the tolling periods and in doing that it refers twice to the defendant which is a term thats used in civil proceedings not administrative proceedings 
 well starting at N usc why its there it in fact applies both to administrative agency actions and actions in courts and sometimes in N usc there are provisions that apply to both the federal tort claims act for example is in N usc and it has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims people must file their claims before an agency first and then the agency can do administrative adjustment thats entirely separate from the attorney generals ability to compromise the claim once its filed in court section title N also contains things that apply to courts and agencies the right to judicial review of agency actions the waiver of immunity thats necessary for those in addition to standards that govern judicial review of agency actions those were all in title N but they actually apply to courts these 
 well N we you you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial official actions can you 
 oh no thats 
 yes 
 actually completely 
 and thats in 
 superfluous 
 and thats in title N 
 and thats in yes thats in title N as well and with respect to the term defendants justice ginsburg congress has often used the term defendants even in the context of administrative actions the stockyard and packers act of N its in N usc N actually talks about a complaint against a defendant for damages all adjudicated before the secretary of agriculture and that was N years ago it seems a little late in the day now to debate whether one can be a defendant the person who defends before an agency as well as the defendant 
 its not the typical term used in agency proceedings to designate the responding party 
 well you can talk about the responding party or the defendant but the term defendant is sufficiently broad to include one who official defends or denies and that would be a term and its been used in the past as long as N years ago to discuss the person who might be liable for damages in 
 and the content 
 an adversary 
 the content of the tolling provision as well seems geared seems geared to a civil lawsuit it talks about a person being outside the united states therefore they wouldnt be amenable to service of process 
 thats certainly right these are all things that would apply we would expect both to a civil action in court and an administrativeagency action as well they may work better for one or the other in different particular circumstances but they are all sufficiently broad that they can be used in both circumstances and the one the government in the administrative context would be most interested in would be subsection c when the government just doesnt know the facts or the government reasonably couldnt know the facts it gets an exception just tolling until it reasonably could have known of the fact and thats just as applicable in an action before an agency as it would be in an action before a court in addition the governments contrary official construction renders an entire provision superfluous and that is the one that justice scalia mentioned section N which is an exception for administrative offsets that exception for administrative offsets would do no work at all if 
 that wasnt part of the original statute was it 
 no that was added about N years later your honor and it was added but it clarifies the scope of the statute and as this court admitted in pointed out in cases like fausto and lafranca the later amendment to a statute can clarify its meaning and indeed statutes are ordinarily read once amended as if they existed in their amended form from the offset 
 i thought that was added because its for a very specific reason that there was a debate between the department of justice and i forgot the other agency 
 the comptroller your honor 
 yes 
 yes about whether an offset would be subject to the time limit 
 thats exactly right and congress resolved that debate by providing an exception for administrative offsets and no other exception for any official 
 what 
 sort of administrative proceeding and that raises the strong inference that in fact this applies to administrative proceedings and it simply doesnt apply to administrative offsets because they are an exception 
 they could have said if the other interpretation of N as not applying to administrative proceedings were correct they could have said the provisions of this section do not apply to administrative proceedings 
 thats 
 which would have which would have handled the offset 
 yes it would have 
 but would have been well beyond the offset and the fact 
 thats exactly right 
 that they only focus on the offset certainly suggests that when you are not talking about offset it does apply to administrative proceedings 
 i could not have said it better and i will not attempt to in fact in addition it raises another anomaly in the statute the governments contrary construction and that is it creates sort of an official irrationality in the hierarchy of claims for the government offensive judicial actions to extract money from private individuals must be brought within N years administrative offsets for the government to try and avoid paying money those must be brought within N years under the administrative offset provision that was enacted together with the exception in however offensive administrative actions to extract money may be brought in perpetuity forever it simply strains credulity to believe that congress at the same time it was saying the government has only N years to assert administrative offsets to avoid paying money instead intended administrative agencies to be able to extract money on that very same claim 
 i can believe that they do 
 in perpetuity 
 i can i can believe that they do that 
 but 
 well justice 
 by mistake but i would not assume a mistake unless its very clear 
 i think thats exactly right justice scalia and thats again going back to fausto official where there is a sensible hierarchy of claims or a sensible hierarchy of preferences the court doesnt ordinarily presume that congress put in a structure that doesnt respect that ordinary hierarchy and the governments construction here is inconsistent with the ordinary hierarchy which allows the government to avoid making payment on more favorable terms then the government gets to go in and forcibly extract money from private individuals finally the governments construction also undermines the intended effect of the statute the effect of statute the purpose of statutes of limitations and this one in particular is to provide repose to allow the individual to know that he will no longer confront government claims to dispose of his documents and also to encourage the government to be diligent in pursuing its claims none of those purposes are achieved all of those purposes are defeated if once the statute of limitations period expires 
 mr lamken 
 yes 
 could we go back to section for a second more is it also possible to say that there was this disagreement between the department of justice and the comptroller general and congress decided official that the comptroller general was right and if thats true should we not accept the comptroller generals reading of the entire statute 
 well if congress had decided the comptroller general is right and had done that in subsection it would have written subsection the way justice scalia proposed which is to say this doesnt apply to administrative claims at all what it did is it said ooh this appears to apply to administrative claims and the comptroller thinks these administrative offsets are important so we will give a special statute of limitations period in N usc for those and exempt them from the more general statute of limitations period in section N usc N so i dont believe that it should be read that way is it frivolous to suggest that thats the reading no the government 
 does the 
 got its 
 legislative history tell us how detailed the congressional examination of the particular issue was 
 well indeed the legislative history mentions and there is a battle of letters between 
 thats about all official 
 the office of legal counsel and the comptroller on this issue and congress actually stepped into the fray and created an exception but it created a limited exception 
 okay 
 an exception that applies only to one context and thats administrative offsets and that certainly raises a very strong inference that where there isnt such an exception the statute applies to administrative proceedings more generally 
 isnt the most likely answer that they just they saw a small problem and they rendered a decision on the small problem and they didnt think about it any further than that 
 well i have a hard time psychoanalyzing congress because its sort of a corporate body and i cant tell what member of member of congress is saying what but when the court of these statutes it generally reads them and it in fact avoids whenever possible superfluity and if this provision applies to administrative proceedings from the outset subsection is superfluous its does no work whatsoever and so the when congress amended this statute it certainly clarified that where there is no exception this statute applies to actions filed in administrative proceedings official if there are no further questions i will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal 
 thank you mr joseffer 
 justice stevens and may it please the court the presumption is that the government is not bound by a statute of limitations and when read as a whole section N does not overcome that presumption but instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in court there are several reasons for that first the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer to suits in court second the statute expressly distinguishes between administrative proceedings and actions third the statutes located in the judicial code fourth the committee reports for those who are inclined to consider them strongly support the statutes ordinary meaning and fifth even if some administrative proceedings were governed by section N these would not because they do not involve a complaint now on the first of those points the term action ordinarily refers to the pursuit of a right in court which just is why just N years ago in west v official gibson every member of this court agreed that the term action often refers only to suits in court and not to administrative proceedings 
 it often does it often does but it does not universally and there are a number of instances cited by the petitioner that where this court and and statutes use the term in context where it clearly applies to administrative proceedings 
 well 
 so the question is how you know how absurd is it not to read it to apply to administrative proceedings in this case and i find it pretty absurd because you assume if you read that it way that there is effectively no statute of limitations whatever for the government in these cases 
 well the structure of the law here is that in those instances where congress does authorize administrative recovery it ordinarily provides a contextspecific administrative limitations period such as in the contract disputes act which governs almost all of the contract claims the government can pursue administratively congress specifically enacted a N year limitations period for the submission of a claim to a contracting officer in this unique context however congress had official very good reasons for not applying a limitations period until it prospectively enacted a partial one in N the reason is that what congress found here in context of mineral leasing based on the findings of an independent commission was that the companies were historically on an honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties of up to half a billion dollars annually so what congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current and past lease accounts one of the committee reports said to focus on old accounts because this was a congress that was not concerned with repose but with getting some of those vast underpayments back from the companies now when we fastforward to N 
 wait 
 at that point 
 excuse me and this was the congress that enacted what 
 no i agreed what im referring to now is the congress that enacted the mineral leasing provisions 
 oh 
 which is not a good 
 which is not what we are talking about here 
 no but well we are because official the structure of the law here is that section N as we see it governs court suits and that works because when congress authorizes administrative recovery it almost always provides a specific contextspecific administrative limitations period also when congress was telling the agency to focus on old accounts it certainly wasnt thinking that a statute of limitations applied to that and the agency in that contemporary context did not understand that there was a limitations period either because the orders that issued in the aftermath of the N act went back N N N sometimes more years than that 
 as late as N the justice department didnt think that way did it 
 no the justice department 
 the opinion of the office of legal counsel in N was exactly what the petitioner here would urge 
 no the olc opinion was limited by both its terms and its reasoning to administrative offsets not to administrative adjudications and if i could explain that an administrative offset occurs in the situation this is what olc was looking at where the government by statute owed retirement benefits to a person and because it thought that person owed it money official what the government did was to unilaterally reduce the retirement benefits what olc opined is that that is a nothing more than a prejudgment attachment and olc thought that if the government is timebarred from obtaining a judgment it should be timebarred from obtaining a prejudgment attachment an administrative adjudication is significantly different because it does provide an actual judgment so there are a couple of important points from that first is that the dispute between olc and the comptroller general was limited by its terms to administrative offsets although justice stevens the comptroller general did opine beyond that that the statute specifically applies only to suits in court but the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets so when congress addressed that specific dispute as justice alito pointed out it resolved only that specific dispute 
 but excuse me how could olc possibly think that it applied to administrative offsets if it didnt apply to administrative proceedings i mean it was a contradiction of the proposition which you are urging here which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings i mean thats the point whether they spoke just to offsets or not the position taken by the justice department was that this statute official relates to administrative proceedings 
 no the position of olc was limited to administrative offsets and it did not the important thing is olc opinion did not interpret the statutory term action or frankly any other statutory term instead it had a theory which was probably wrong that administrative offsets are unique because they are prejudgment attachment devices thats the dispute that went to congress and thats the dispute that congress actually resolved and in any event going forward 
 well on that theory then there was there was no time issue with respect to the right to offset then in the olcs position 
 no the olcs view is that if the government was timebarred from obtaining a judgment under section N then it would be timebarred from obtaining a prejudgment attachment 
 no but i thought your in answer to justice scalia you said what was essential to the to olcs position was that the offset is like a prejudgment attachment and in effect its an attachment without process if thats the case then timing should have nothing to do with it conversely as justice scalia said if timing does have something to do with it timing official presumably derives from this provision this provision therefore must have been assumed to apply to administrative proceedings so either theres no time question with respect to the offsets or if there is a time question with respect to the offsets it implies an olc position that this provision applies to administrative proceedings 
 well 
 whats wrong with that logic 
 i think whats wrong with the logic is what was wrong with the logic of the olc opinion we dont mean to defend the 
 you put me 
 reasoning of the olc opinion 
 in good company but 
 but what olc really did say and comptroller general and congress promptly disagreed was that it didnt see a problem olc didnt see a problem with procedurally imposing an administrative offset what it saw a problem with was it thought if an a judgment would be timebarred then a prejudgment attachment should be timebarred as well i mean that was the reasoning of the 
 no but if it was 
 olc opinion which official 
 a prejudgment 
 i agree was 
 it was a prejudgment attachment in aid of what could be accomplished administratively by ultimately an administrative judgment 
 no the i guess it was another point the olc opinion was arose in the context where a judgment could be obtained at all only in court 
 do we have 
 in the context of 
 that opinion by the way both sides cited it the is it it was unpublished 
 it was unpublished and 
 does anybody give it to us 
 petitioners offered to lodge it with the court 
 yes i know they did offer but nobody did it 
 i will we will do it this afternoon 
 good i would like that 
 the points just the olc reasoning was admittedly somewhat odd but that was the context in which congress was responding to and going forward it is not surplusage because the issue still official arises if the government could pursue its suit only in court it would be timebarred from pursuing a suit in court the question would then still arise under the olc opinion unless it had been overruled whether the government could nonetheless obtain a prejudgment attachment even though it cannot obtain judgment thats all that congress was looking at there and as this courts recognized in cases like ogilvie and vonn when congress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute oftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more than that we i agree though that terms to get back to the beginning of this discussion terms do not always have their ordinary meanings but they presumptively do especially when a statute must be strictly construed and here the context confirms that action does have its ordinary meaning for several reasons first the ordinary meanings of the other key statutory terms such as right of action complaint and defendant as justice ginsberg pointed out all ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court a right of action is the right to bring a suit in court a defendant is the person defending in court ordinarily and a complaint is the document that initiates proceedings by stating a claim thats seeking relief in a official civil action which is a suit in court especially when those terms are used together this court recognized in unexcelled chemical that a reference to commencing a action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a suit in court not a pleading before an administrative agency the statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose an action against an administrative proceeding by saying that the time to file an action does not run until after the administrative proceedings have concluded which certainly gives weight to the point that the action is an administrative proceeding is not an action 
 would the at the time that N is that the 
 its N 
 N im sorry at the time that was enacted were there any limitations in other statutes on the commencement of administrative proceedings 
 the ones that we have found were im not N percent sure but the ones that we that we have found and cited in our brief do appear to be enacted after that time i think the reason is that i mean historically administrative obviously court suits have been around a lot longer than administrative adjudications and as congress has authorized official administrative adjudications its dealt with them on a casebycase basis and every time that it enacted a contextspecific administrative adjudications period since N in theory it could have just done an acrosstheboard one for all agency adjudications but instead its chosen to deal with the contextspecific in part because of the great variety of administrative procedure i mean as this case illustrates a statute of limitations that governs a complaint in an action is just not going to work in a lot of administrative contexts here theres no complaint an order is a legally binding order it doesnt seek relief it imposes it and unless it is both appealed and stayed pending appeal 
 how about the initial letter that in the agency practice precedes the order i gather theres a letter to the 
 right theres there are basically three steps here first theres an audit then if the audit reveals an apparent discrepancy the agency or a state with delegate authority would send an issue letter requesting an explanation 
 an issue letter 
 yes its called an issue official letter and then would basically request an explanation of the apparent discrepancy and then if the agency then decides after consideration of the audit and the issue letter that its appropriate to issue an order to pay it will do so it 
 sounds to me like a complaint a response 
 an issue letter 
 and an adjudication i mean you know 
 i dont know whether you mean the audit 
 we think you owe this 
 or the issue letter but either way 
 the response comes back i dont think we owe it and heres why and then theres a ruling you do owe it and thats the order and then you can appeal it and the cfr refers to it as an appeal 
 yes well there are a few things first on the with respect to the issue letter i mean a complaint functionally is a document that initiates proceedings stating it by stating the claim for relief is seeking relief in a civil action with official respect to the second of those an issue letter does not is not an allegation of wrongdoing and it does not seek relief it seeks information so that the agency can determine whether or not an apparent discrepancy raised by an audit is in fact a discrepancy but theres 
 it does not 
 no claim 
 assert that theres a discrepancy 
 well what it what it asserts is that we have done an audit and the audit has raised the following issues thats why its called an issue letter please provide an explanation and it so at that point the agency has not decided yet whether it is in fact asserting a claim its not and its not requesting relief which a complaint definitely does all its requesting is information to help the agency assess the issue 
 do we have an example of issue letters anywhere thats not in the materials either is it in the 
 no in fact its not even in fact its not even in the administrative record 
 right 
 which is one of the reasons official its not in the issue 
 do we know 
 record of the case 
 what time lapse 
 which also reflects that its not a formal complaint or it would be in the record 
 do we know in this case what time lapse there was between the issue letter and the order 
 i dont think it was more than a year or two 
 but 
 and there was 
 would that if you took the issue letter as the day wouldnt all of the all of the governments claims be timely because we are only talking about part of the claim anyway as i understand it is that correct 
 here i think if you ran 
 i dont think so i tried to figure that out i think 
 yes if it ran from the 
 i think 
 if it ran from the issue letter official 
 okay 
 i think there would still be about a year in dispute here 
 there would be some in dispute 
 going forward if we 
 but 
 if we agree with your position the result will be that there will be a N year limitations period for oil and gas leases but for indian claims and for minerals there will be no statute of limitations 
 yes and the reason is that thats what congress chose to do i mean in the prospective N act it 
 did they 
 enacted the limitations 
 when they enacted the N year limitation period did they explain why they would treat those two situations so differently 
 no theres no explanation as a practical matter though the prospective N legislation governs a wide variety of aspects of the of the relationship between the federal government and the lessees and on balance that package was pretty favorable to the oil companies and i think congress official probably just decided not to to apply that to itself but not to the indians getting back to the order though its not only that 
 how do you defend against a claim for you know stuff that went on a hundred years ago 
 well as a 
 i im really very reluctant to unless there is no possible other reading of the statute to think that thats that thats what the law provides that the government can show up a hundred years later and say oh by the way you owe all this money 
 well first off until 
 the company says gee i you know i dont have records from a hundred years ago 
 right well there are a few points both legal and practical on the legal until N that absolutely was the law because historically no limitations period ever applies against the government and thats the reason for the strict construction canon that the statute applies here only if it clearly applies and thereby bars the government from forcing the law in the public interest 
 say that again until N official there were no statute of limitations against any government suits 
 not contract i mean the historic rule is that the government is not bound by statutes of limitations because what its doing is enforcing the law in the public interest now in N congress enacted section N so that there would prospectively be a contract limitations period but its strictly construed because of the historical backdrop and the importance of enforcing the law in the public interest so thats why we do have a strict construction canon here as a 
 he didnt apply against the government either 
 for the same reason laches is never applied against the government 
 so theres no limit at all and you concede that thats the case so the government could go back on these royalties as long as it likes 
 well as an abstract theoretical matter the government could reach back many many decades as a practical matter though thats never happened that we have gone back say N or N years and there are practical reasons for that first is that the agency does not have enough resources to audit official 
 well theres a case involving the oneida indians that went back quite a ways 
 thats true its i meant in the 
 N years 
 leasing context here 
 yes 
 i didnt mean in the leasing context here but in the leasing context one there are a couple of important points one is that the government does not have enough resources to audit all of the current accounts in all of the years which is one of the reasons that we need to be able to go back farther when we catch the violation as a but as a result the notion that we are going to pull auditing resources off of today to do a frolicking detour into N years ago theres a reason thats never happened in addition the farther we try to go back the greater the proof problems because oftentimes only the companies have the information that shows what royalties they would owe and if they lawfully destroy those records after N years it makes it even harder for us to try to go back because of proof problems 
 thats another indication why would you allow them to destroy those records after N official years if you if you thought if you thought that there was no statute of limitations to claims for these things i mean thats just another inconsistency that in the statutory scheme thats created 
 well no the 
 you say you can destroy your records after N years well why it doesnt make any sense 
 well first its optional not mandatory if they want to keep them they 
 yes 
 certainly can but theres no and as a practical matter i mean because the government bears the initial burden of going forward if the company destroys the sources of proof thats on balance going to be in its favor but in addition theres not a strict congruence between the N year periods because first the companies only have to keep records for N years but in some circumstances the secretary can require they be kept for longer in addition sometimes the statute of limitations because of tolling is much longer than N years and so the lawful destruction of records would still leave absenceofproof issues in situations where the statute might because of tolling be much longer so theres not a strict official congruence there is also no indication that congress enacted the N year recordsretention policy because it was thinking about a N year limitations period theres never been any linkage between the two if i could briefly cover then also i mean in addition to all the textual points this is also located in the judicial code and although its true that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply to administrative proceedings they say that expressly every time the word action is used in the judicial code and petitioners identified no examples every time the word action is used in the judicial code it refers to a suit in court and only a suit in court when a provision of the judicial code applies to something else it will say so for example N us code N which is a statute of limitations for penalty proceedings refers to an action suit or proceeding the federal tort claims act is very clear that what its talking about is submitting something to an agency so if congress was going to legislate against the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms that ordinarily refer to suits in court and put the provision in the judicial code i mean that just is a totally irrational way of expressing intent especially official clear especially a clear intent when its trying to govern administrative proceedings the committee reports also strongly confirm that because they not only say that the statute defines the time limitation for bringing an action in the us courts and not only use court terminology from front to back they also say like the statute that they are aware of the administrative proceedings but what they are saying is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings the committee has explained that the reason for that provision was the great number and variety of administrative proceedings so in other words congress was saying theres a great variety of administrative procedure we are just not going to deal with that here we are taking it off the table by saying this limitations period does not expire until a year after those administrative proceedings whatever they might be have expired theres also some relevance in the fact that this legislation was proposed by the justice department as part of an overall package of reforms that would govern the civil litigation that the department was handling in the courts it was then referred to the judiciary committees not to the house government reform committees official that might consider administrative procedure matters and as i mentioned before was enacted as part of the judicial code from start to finish this legislation has never had anything to do with anything other than court suits which is why congress has expressly provided for contextspecific administrative systems limitations periods which make sense in the context of the relevant administrative procedures 
 well except when you when you say this legislation you limit it to the body of N and you leave out which or i guess its one is it little or 
 its it is 
 its i mean that clearly does apply to administrative proceedings and i could understand the argument that congress was just making things doubly clear okay that does not apply to administrative proceedings i could understand that argument if the way was written is the provisions of this section shall not apply to administrative proceedings and then i would say you know oh well that was always the case and this is just making it clear it doesnt say that it says that the only official administrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these offsets 
 i think the reason is that 
 and you know the normal rule is inclusio unius exclusio alterius i would it means to me when i read the statute as a whole and thats the way i read statutes i dont ask whether this section was adopted this year and the other section was adopted next year i dont do it bite by bite you look at the whole text and when you read all this stuff together it seems to me that the import of is that administrative proceedings despite the fact that action is not a very common word to use for them are covered 
 i mean its theres no doubt the statute should be read as a whole but as this court has explained in cases like the ogilvie and vonn cases cited in our brief when a courts trying to make sense of a statute read as a whole oftentimes it will find that when congress faces a specific dispute and amends a statute to resolve that specific dispute thats all it resolves and theres no reason to draw further negative inference especially here as the court of appeals pointed out where a strict construction canon applies 
 thats the best thing you have going for you really the strict construction canon official 
 well because i mean and it is an important point that the statute applies only if it clearly applies by its terms and it seems to me the best that petitioners can do is to say that some of the statutory terms in isolation are ambiguous but that all that means as i said is that under the strict construction canon we would prevail and even if the statute governs some administrative proceedings but not others it would not govern these for the reason i gave earlier which is that theres no complaint here we talked before about the ways in which an order is not a complaint its another important point though that in order not only it is not only does it not begin the proceedings it normally ends them because appeals are only taken about a quarter of the time and in some limited circumstances theres not even a right of appeal if the assistant secretary issued the order so 
 what if i didnt think the order was a complaint but i thought the initial letter was a complaint would the petitioner lose because they never made that argument 
 correct its the only argument they have ever made 
 yes 
 is that an order is a official complaint so they havent preserved the point 
 because you are 
 but 
 you made the point that the issue letter is just raising the issues and its not charging as a complaint would allege you owe us but this is maybe you owe us 
 correct theres no in an issue letter theres no claim for relief just a claim for the request for information and theres no allegation of wrongdoing so its just not a complaint in those ways also it doesnt its not really fair to say that it begins proceedings because it comes between an audit and an order to pay so it doesnt and plus its of course not filed in a civil action and in that respect it doesnt satisfy any of the any of the elements of the of the ordinary definition of complaints 
 are you saying that this doesnt apply to any administrative proceeding or just those that are structured like this one where you dont have anything thats labeled a complaint 
 we well our primary submission is that it does not apply to any administrative proceedings for the reason reasons i have given that official the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms are for suits in court a complaint itself is ordinarily defined to be 
 even if you have an administrative proceeding which is called a complaint you know i mean and some are i think 
 there are there are some contexts in administrative procedure in which the word complaint is used 
 and that would not be covered by N 
 because its not filed in an action which refers to a suit in court following occurral of a right of action which refers to the right to bring suit in court in a statute which then juxtaposes the terms action against administrative proceedings 
 and lets assume all those terms are used in the agency procedure they are talking about action right of action all those terms are used in the agencys procedural rules would they then come under this thing 
 no 
 i think you have to say no 
 yes 
 because otherwise it would official be up to the agency just by renaming their things to come in or out right 
 well and its a much more 
 yes 
 fundamental point than that too is that what congress was doing here was when using these terms in their ordinary sense to lay out an acrosstheboard rule that applies to suits in court and finally one thing i should also emphasize is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive administrative scheme petitioners like to say that well we could just as easily be in court theres a reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever been brought by the government in a court and thats first that congress directed the agency to establish a comprehensive auditing and collection system and then gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its administrative orders the only way the agency could administer thousands of leases with something like $N billion in royalties every year is to do this in an efficient administrative manner congress has not only authorized that and ratified it it has strengthened that scheme and told the agency as i said in N to go back and look at old leases precisely because congress knew that is a official standalone administrative scheme and its never provided the administrative limitations period for the standalone administrative scheme if there are no more questions 
 thank you mr joseffer mr lamken as i understand it you have about N minutes left you dont have to use them all 
 i will endeavor not to thank you justice stevens i wanted to start with the ordinary meaning of the term action i was somewhat bemused by the governments insistence that had the term action in west versus gibson was construed it must mean an action before a court and has that as its ordinary meaning the solicitor generals own position in west versus gibson on page N and N of its brief was section N does not however define the term action as being limited to judicial proceedings the statutory language read in context suggests that no such limitation was intended page N of the governments reply the term action in section N can reasonably be construed as official encompassing both administrative and judicial proceedings the term action is a term thats used for adversary adjudicative proceedings whether those are in court or before an agency it is not limited to administrative agency proceedings as the government itself recognized in west versus gibson there are more general terms here theres also complaint theres also defendant theres a number of those but those general terms are also the terms of adversary adjudication and congress uses them as far back as N for adversary adjudications before agencies 
 mr lamken have you had any second thoughts about your position that its the order rather than the issue letter that we should look at 
 well in fact no but the the answer is that we didnt no issue was engaged as to what was the functional equivalent of the complaint below that raised was raised for the first time by the solicitor general in its merits brief saying no no no theres actually some stuff that comes before the order but if i would encourage the court to look at the definitions in fogrsfa N and N which tell you what under in congresss view commences the official proceedings here and in congresss view what commences the proceedings what triggers the new statute of limitations and stops it from running is the order to pay which congress defines as a demand 
 well thats true thats true but the provision you are arguing that you come under does talk about a complaint 
 thats 
 and thats what you know thats what starts the N years running and its seems to me odd to call something a complaint which is in fact an order they are not complaining about anything they are saying pay the money 
 actually justice scalia 
 you know usually a complaint you are you make your point and say what do you say whats your answer 
 well 
 and this is an order you are boom pay 
 it certainly has a hybrid quality justice scalia and its not a hybrid quality that the industry particularly likes but it is the first time that the government asserts its state its claims as to whats wrong in a binding legally operative document official where the failure to respond results in default it has that function as complaint it is the first salvo in official formal administrative proceedings 
 well thats only true if you consider an appeal to be the response and thats rather weird that 
 it is 
 that the response to a complaint is an appeal 
 the language that has been used and as a result of very odd historical anomalies and attempts to introduce a sense of due process to these proceedings over time is odd and it is awkward but its clear that when congress wrote the scope of this statute it said it applies to every action for money damages by the government which is founded in contract it doesnt say actions that are begun by complaint now the complaint is what congress assumes will stop the provision from running and there is always in an adversary adjudication some document that functions like a complaint that provides the defendant the notice of what the claims are against it and to which failure to respond will result in default we believe that the most likely thing to be the complaint here is the thing that provided us with notice official is that boys you have got to respond otherwise you are in trouble was the order to pay and congress came to that same conclusion when it enacted when it enacted fogrsfa and established a N year statute of limitations provision but if we lose N years of the claim and only get N because it is the agency letter in the courts view well thats fine but theres some document here that started these agency proceedings and it is that document which is a complaint 
 could you get us we are going to have supplemental material filed the olc opinion could you could you get us a you know a sample of an agency letter or if you cant maybe the government can 
 yes i thats true and in terms of the olc letter we offered to lodge it in our brief unfortunately by the courts rules we are not allowed to lodge it unless the court specifically requests it and so thats why its not there but we will get that to you or the government will get it to you as soon as possible the actual agency letter in this case isnt in the administrative record and it turns out that we havent been able to find it and the government hasnt been able to find it and so its a letter its a official demand letter but it is a letter and that the order to pay is actually the opening salvo in these proceedings and again what opens the proceedings in the justice department regulations and other regulations 
 may i suggest 
 to try to define 
 this mr lamken that when the when the filing is made giving us the olc opinion you include a an example of such a letter 
 yes yes of course 
 and so we will get a notion of what it looks like 
 right it may have to be from some other proceeding it wouldnt necessarily be from this case 
 your position is this would apply to the universe of administrative proceedings now this particular lease arrangement is taken care of by an express statute of limitations so what we are talking about for the future what would change under your interpretation not gas leases because theres a N year limitation for both administrative orders to pay and 
 right 
 court actions official 
 right it would be all leases on indian lands it would be all leases which involve minerals other than oil and gas whether it be coal gold silver anything like that it would also be all claims before september all production before september of N that introduces something of an oddity if one accepts the governments position it would be that for all claims going forward from september of N the government has N years but for the prior N years those claims persist in perpetuity when section N itself was enacted congress avoided precisely that result by deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date the statute of limitations was enacted and the very fact that congress didnt do that here is evidence that congress to the extent it has anything to do with it at all is evidence that congress in fact understood that there already was a statute of limitations applicable and in fact 
 what 
 it also 
 what other areas would we be messing up by finding for you i mean here you know if we dont find that this administrative action is covered by this statute of limitations theres no statute of limitations but there may there are other may be official other areas covered by this text namely a suit by the united states founded upon any contract expressly or implied in law or in fact where there is some kind of a statute of limitations 
 right there are there are some contexts in which there already is a separate administrative regime which would have its own statute of limitations the contract disputes act as the government points out is one of those 
 and that would prevail over this 
 yes because the 
 because its more 
 contract disputes 
 specific 
 act has an exception at the front and says notwithstanding N its its own animal to itself and there is a clause at the front of N that says except as otherwise provided by congress and so congress often takes exceptions and when it modified the mineral leasing act of N that was an exception to the N regime so congress knows how to conduct specialized situations and take things outside of N when it needs to but it enacted section N as a catchall for all of those situations where congress hadnt official managed to anticipate the circumstances and the governments premise of the whole provision is that congress botched it congress provided a catchall that catches judicial actions but leaves the government free in perpetuity to persist to proceed on precisely the same claims for precisely the same relief plus interest and because interest is calculated at a relatively high rate that makes those old claims much much more valuable than the relatively more recent claims and it seems implausible to think that congress enacted a catchall limitations period with a loophole so large that it deprives the statute of limitations period of effect almost entirely finally id like to say one moment about the statute the canon of strict construction and that is that it doesnt always require the court to narrow otherwise broad statutory language particularly where doing so would have the effect of rendering another provision here subsection is superfluous introducing anomalies into the statutory structure and depriving the statute of its intended effect as the bowers case we cite in our reply brief on page N makes clear and bowers case was virtually on point it was the case where the it was a statute of limitations that could have applied to administrative agency actions official or it could not have and the court declined to accept a narrowing construction proffered by the government under statute of strict construction because it would have rendered one of the provisions one for consent proceedings superfluous because it would have resulted in anomaly and because it would have undermined the premise of repose which undergirded the statute of limitations in that case precisely the same things are true here and for those reasons the court should reach precisely the same result if there are no further questions thank you very much 
 thank you mr lamken the case is taken is as submitted 
 we will hear argument next in global crossing telecommunications versus metrophones telecommunications mr fisher 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court complaints alleging violations of the fccs pay phone compensation regulations allege just that violations of regulations the regulatory violations do not give rise to private cause of action under section N and N of the communications act the proper point of departure in this case begins at section N there congress directed the fcc to create a system guaranteeing pay phone providers compensation for the services that they provide to callers who make dial around calls there can be little doubt that the fcc has ample authority to enforce the system it created administratively but nothing in section N or anywhere else in the act contemplates that violations of the fccs implementing regulations should give rise to a private cause of action for damages in federal court official accordingly this court should reverse the ninth circuits decision allowing pay phone operators to bring through the back door the kinds of cases that congress declined to allow through the front theres nothing upsetting about reaching that result here the communications act quite sensibly limits private damages actions in federal court to those alleging violations of the act itself and claims that long distance providers im sorry claims that long distance providers have violated the pay phone compensation regulations require the parsing and the application of the extraordinarily complex and everchanging fcc rules and regulations and orders 
 mr fisher may i ask you this question in your view did the regulations create a legally enforceable obligation 
 yes justice stevens 
 and where may that obligation be enforced 
 our position is that can be fully enforced in the fcc and in fact the fcc is hearing complaints like this all the time 
 by means of a private action before the fcc 
 yes by means of an administrative official action before the fcc 
 where the carrier where they would file a complaint saying you owe us x dollars and the agency could order them to pay x dollars 
 thats right and if you look at the sprint amicus brief at page N the brief cites several cases just like this one that the fcc has fully adjudicated and in some cases awarded damages 
 and is the obligation enforceable in state court 
 no we believe of course this court did not grant certiorari 
 i understand that im curious to know what your view is 
 if this court holds there is no private cause of action in federal court then it is not enforceable in state court either our position is that there is only an administrative remedy thats available 
 but the administrative remedy that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private right of action or isnt it would you get the same thing i complained to the agency and say i didnt get the pay phone provider wasnt paid and x under the commissions regulations was supposed to pay it so i complained against x could i get before the fcc exactly official what i could get in court so that we are only talking about which form is proper or is there a difference in the remedy 
 in terms of damages we are talking about exactly the same thing justice ginsburg the only difference between being in federal court as opposed to the agency is that if you are in federal court the communications act has a fee shifting provision and we think that further underscores the congresss scheme here which is to reserve federal court actions for serious violations of the communications act and thats where fee shifting kicks in ordinary 
 and before the agency you dont get counsel fees 
 thats right 
 mr fisher i realize you dont concede in fact quite to the contrary you deny that the failure to pay the full rate is could be considered a practice here but lets assume for the sake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning of the text if the if the agency had explicitly said what we are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful or unjust is to define it as such within the meaning of what is it N so they make explicit reference to official the statute and they say we are fleshing out the statute would your position be the same 
 i think thats very much what the commission is contending here justice souter 
 but it wasnt textually as nice as that 
 right 
 but they have made it that havent they in a later regulation havent they said just that 
 in a later order justice scalia 
 in a later order yes 
 lets assume in the reg itself they were that precise would your position be exactly the same 
 yes the result would be the same and i think you are asking me to put aside for the moment whether the fcc was correct in saying it was a covered practice 
 sure 
 and in terms of the fcc calling this unjust and unreasonable the problem with that is that the only reason the fcc has ever given that this is unjust and unreasonable is because it violates its regulations and if theres one thing we know from the official structure of the communications act its that for something to be remedial in federal court in other words and if we know something violates N it is remediable 
 okay 
 it has to be 
 you invite me to change the hypothetical then by jacking it up in this respect the fcc gives the reason and it says the reason its unjust and unreasonable is that the carriers are getting a free ride on the pay phones et cetera so they fill in the gap that you claim they have a reason would your answer or your position still be the same 
 yes because the reasoning the fcc would give simply would not be a permissible construction of the terms unjust and unreasonable in N 
 are there any times under any circumstances that you can think of in which the fcc can adequately and validly define a practice as unjust and unreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that in fact in applying the statute we would follow be bound to follow the regs 
 of course in the vast majority let me give you some examples and then i will distinguish it official from this case the easiest example is rate of return regulations that the fcc can pronounce so the fcc can say how much long distance companies are able to charge for certain services fleshing out the amount that they can charge so that they are not in effect gouging consumers is a regulation that this court could look to but 
 okay but why cant they pass a regulation that says dont gouge pay phone operators 
 well that goes to the heart of this case justice souter in the kind of regulations that we have what we have here is not the fcc telling long distance providers to give pay phone operators money that long distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators the money thats at issue here the N cents per call is the money that callers owe the pay phone operators if you look back at the dc circuits decision 
 well do they i mean the statute of the united states says that i think im correct the statute of the united states says they cant be required the caller cannot be required to put in the quarter in order to get the N number and so on so as a matter of law dont we have to say that the in practical terms the caller doesnt owe official somebody owes somebody ought to pay for the use of this facility but congress has said it is not the end user 
 you are right justice souter insofar as we are trying to capture the money here for essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that the caller is availing himself of but congress has not said that money cannot rest on the callers shoulders all congress says in section N is that the caller cannot be required to pay in advance the fcc during its rulemaking proceedings actually considered two alternatives where the caller would have paid in full compliance with section N one would be the caller paying with a later billing device like a credit card billing it to their home phone number another option the fcc considered would have been where the long distance providers would have billed customers on behalf of the pay phone operators either way the customer would have paid even the respondent in his brief openly 
 well the customer is going to pay if in fact the long distance carrier is the one who has to make the immediate payment because that payment is going to be figured in the long distance rate so that ultimately the end user is going to pay for the service he gets and congress is simply saying the way official to make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is to require the long distance carrier to make the reimbursement the economic end result is exactly the same as it would have been if they had said well you can send a bill for N cents to the end user 
 the economic result may be the same but with all due respect congress has not decreed that the administrative system work this way 
 it hasnt decreed otherwise 
 it hasnt decreed otherwise congress essentially 
 isnt that the classic situation in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do 
 congress gave the fcc power in N to come up with a plan but this case as the ninth circuit decided it is not under N it is under N so the question is whether failing to comply with the administrative plan 
 well as i understand it it came to the conclusion not that they were not acting under N but that in fact the cause of action has to refer back to N 
 thats right im sorry it brings official us back to the question that you asked whether the ninth circuit or the fcc for that matter can shoehorn this into N as an unjust and unreasonable practice 
 in your answer for why they cant justice souters comment is a classic this is what administrative agencies do all the time in typical rate regulations they make a determination that utility shareholders have to bear this cost the rate payers can bear this cost and at the end of the day it is a determination that a rate is reasonable or unreasonable and it seems to me that that is just what is involved here i dont know why their determination about how to allocate who has to collect the rates and whether they can pass them on or not makes it an impermissible interpretation of whats unjust or unreasonable under N 
 well chief justice roberts the fcc was unquestionably acting under N when it did this so the question is whether you can go back to N and as i said you need to start with section N and N because we are in federal court and that says that violations of the act are remediable but not of regulations in contrast to numerous other sections so the question in asking whether it violates N official it has to be something more than simply the fccs regulation wasnt followed and we need to ask ourselves what kind of regulation is it 
 are rate making regulations issued under N do they purport to be the fccs definition of what is just and reasonable compensation 
 thats right thats what i conceded to justice souter earlier 
 they are issued under N 
 i think largely they are 
 so they are an interpretation of the statutory language in N 
 thats right 
 and you say this one is not 
 thats right and this court can look several places but it can first look to these this regulatory regime that was created which was always thought of as being triggered by section N and then asking 
 when you say it was always thought of as being triggered by N did the fcc reference N in issuing its determination that a failure to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable 
 in its order it references N and N in the regulations i thought i was being asked official about the regulations it leads with N 
 suppose it issued the regulation after notice and comment and said violation of the pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice would the case be different 
 no it wouldnt be and i think i want to flesh out and make sure i have gotten across the distinction between the rate making 
 you havent maybe if this doesnt clarify it i think everyone has about the same question you have a bunch of pay phone operators and if the at and t were charging them too much i think everybody would say that the fcc can say hey thats too much you owe them N cents a call refund and everybody would agree that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring a lawsuit and get the N cents right under N usc N now the only difference here seems to be that it wasnt at and t that was charging in my example too much they werent paying what they owed they should have paid what they owed and that says the fcc is under N an unreasonable practice and therefore go in and collect it in court now what is the answer to that so far i have heard nothing that suggests official that this couldnt be an unreasonable practice under N which is just what the fcc said it was now whats wrong with what i said im simply trying to focus you upon what i think is the question thats bothering some of us 
 there are two things that are wrong with that justice breyer the first thing is that in contrast to ordinary rate making regulations here in the absence of regulations long distance providers would owe pay phone operators zero theres no reason why long distance providers would give money to pay phone operators the N cents here is to capture what callers owe the pay phone operators and so the fcc has come up with an administrative system but theres nothing unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory regime drops into place whereas there is plenty that is unjust and unreasonable about overcharging for example 
 so my answer not answer but my characterization of what you have just said is that the fcc did say it was an unreasonable practice but in your view it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay and you want us to go back and secondguess which official we could if their view of unreasonable practice is unreasonable itself and i guess you would have to overturn it i didnt know that was what the case was about but are you saying now that thats the issue they said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this money you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay the money there is a dispute thats what we should do 
 no 
 okay then what should we do 
 well what you should do is reverse the ninth circuit 
 you say it would be a reasonable practice not to pay the money but for the existence of the regulation 
 thats exactly right 
 just like at and t when in fact or any other utility that in fact runs into situations every day of the week where but for an fcc regulation they would not be overcharging because they have a way of doing it that isnt on its face unjust but the fcc writes some regulations and now it is unjust so i guess to take that argument would overturn i guess about a hundred years of rate making law wouldnt it 
 no it wouldnt justice scalia i official think has captained that position and what we are saying is the fcc can pick a fair rate once it is something that long distance providers or any common carrier ought to be compensating somebody for but what we are saying here is this is a purely administrative creature and then it gets to the second reason why 
 so in other words you are saying i think it is common that the fcc might write some accounting rules for example and they might say before these accounting rules mr bells system in san francisco you could charge people N cents a call but given the way we set up the accounting rules we think this month you have to do N cents in the first six months N cents in the next six months N cents and any deviation from that is unreasonable and the company does deviate i would have always thought when they do deviate they are behaving unreasonably and someone who pays too much could go into court and get money back am i wrong about that 
 no you would have been right justice breyer we are not asking even the louisiana public service commission is another example of something and that brings me i think i should go back to what 
 before you go back lets hear official about the accounting rules what would they be issued under would they be issued under N 
 they might the question that we would ask is whether it affects carriers relationships to their customers now under justice breyers hypothetical and this is the louisiana public service commission 
 it seems to me accounting rules in order to decide what is just and reasonable you have to have accounting rules so the accounting rules fit very comfortably under N 
 i dont think we are disagreeing what i want to do is distinguish those from the case we have here and go back to justice souters 
 may i focus your return to me because i want to take up with where your answer to justice scalia left off as i understand it you were saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because the party or the person who is responsible for the use of the pay phone facilities is the person whos making the call not the long distance carrier my question to you is isnt that simply a choice of characterization because another way of looking at it would be that the person who makes the call wants to use long distance facilities to get to the person he official wants to talk to and therefore the long distance facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone in order to get the customer to what the long distance facility provides why then isnt it just as fair to characterize the use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the carrier as for the benefit of the customer and if that is just as fair doesnt that end the distinction that you drew with justice scalia saying that it is not fair in this case 
 no for two reasons the first is i just want to be clear we are not challenging the fccs authority to have created the regulatory regime it did under N so the fcc could well have picked as it did long distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here but the reason but the problem with saying that im sorry i lost the train of thought in your question 
 my question is simply you can say one way of looking at this transaction is it is the guy making the call whos using it another way is to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it to get the call to the long distance facility if you look at it in way b doesnt your argument for unreasonableness disappear official 
 thank you that would be an entirely different case than the one we have here justice souter the N cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup here if you go back and look at the regulatory system and thats what they are asking for is the N cents that the fcc regulations entitle us to was calculated in fact the dc circuit made the fcc go through this exercise three times to get it right so to calculate that N cents it is purely a function of the amount of money that the caller owes the pay phone operator 
 what difference does that make what difference does that make the use of the phone is of a value of N cents but the value of using the phone is a value not only to the caller but to the long distance provider who couldnt provide anything to the caller without the pay phone why isnt the alternative characterization just as easy regardless of how they get to N cents 
 i think another way to perhaps characterize your position is why is this like a commission that they are seeking and the reason why is because that number may be very different than N cents if there was such a commission that could exist it would be far less and the respondents are not seeking that amount of money official 
 excuse me but arent you arguing with the N cents as opposed to creating an argument about what is the proper characterization of the transaction 
 i dont think so all im saying is if you started with trying to compensate pay phone operators for the service they provide that you are characterizing as the service they provide to long distance carriers you end up with a far different number who knows what you would end up with probably end up with zero because take an example of somebody who rents a cell phone for the weekend they might make lots of long distance calls on the cell phone but nobody has ever thought that a long distance carrier ought to be kicking back money for example to the store that rented the cell phone to the customer over the weekend and i want to return i think in justice breyers question 
 the reason is that the store that rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the cell phone and in the case of the pay phone the pay phone operator is going to get zero unless there is some such scheme as this 
 right but then we are back to the rental income question and the question of whether it official would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance providers absent the regulations to be the ones paying that rental income and the answer we submit is no and the problem that i think we have gotten off on a couple times brings us back i think to the assumption you asked me to make at the beginning of the argument that something is a covered practice under the act and so another way to understand the distinction between the accounting rules the rate making exercises and all the rest in this case is that section N of the act doesnt cover everything in connection with a communications service it only covers certain practices in connection and the history as well as the text and structure shows that it regulates common carriers acting as such 
 it doesnt cover certain practices in connection it covers all practices in connection 
 i think we agree with respondent mr chief justice that in looking at N you have the word such communication practices and to understand what that is referring to you look back up at N and see the universe now the beginning of N is what we colloquially call the carrier customer section of the official act and thats the core of N which says that when a common carrier is providing service it needs to act justly and reasonably here and with accounting and rate making and all the rest those are things that affect rates and service to customers what we have in this case is something very different this is a carriercarrier relationship so you need to look somewhere else and what respondent says is you look to the end of N which talks about physical interconnections between carriers but the problem with that argument and the reason why this falls outside N even if it is somehow unjust and unreasonable is that the carriercarrier relationships are governed only when the fcc has ordered physical interconnection 
 so you are saying that putting aside N it would clearly be impermissible for the fcc to say one way that long distance carriers provide service to their customers is when those customers use pay phones and therefore we are setting up this rate regime in connection with that service you would say that would be outside the scope of N 
 as we are still talking generically i dont think it necessarily would be because it could regulate the relationship between long distance providers official and their customers i mean thats the core of what N is about its about how much they can charge what kind of practices they can have in relationship to their customers but here we are not talking about a long distance provider that is a common carrier in relationship to its customers or in relation to its rates and practices 
 thats actually thats i think your strong to me that was the strongest argument when i finished reading it i thought well so what you know i mean can you see why i thought that i mean todays rule is different it is true that you dont have simply a single telephone company providing service ultimately directly to the customer you have everything mixed up and there are a lot of intercarrier things language covers it purpose covers it facts and circumstances change 
 we submit it is a not a so what justice breyer because section N is broad but its not allencompassing and congress plenty of times in section N and in lots of other sections of the communications act has responded to modern necessity by giving the fcc expanded jurisdiction just as it did as i said here in section N but our core position here is that when congress official expands the fccs authority and it doesnt create a concomitant federal right of action along with it it is telling the fcc to handle these things administratively use its expertise craft regulations and enforce them accordingly 
 mr fisher can i go back to the first question i asked you would the fcc have had authority to create an administrative remedy that had a fee shifting provision in it 
 the fcc might have that authority section N as well as other sections in the act give the commission broad authority in crafting its administrative enforcement regimes i havent focused on that exact question but it might well be able to say that in order to have this properly enforced we need to have fee shifting 
 it could certainly impose penalties of some kind 
 yes it could and the fcc could double fine the fcc could do lots of things thats our very purpose is that the fcc ought to be the single forum deciding what kind of an enforcement mechanism is best not leaving it to federal courts across the country and as ninth circuit invites state court rulings across the country with varying rules official if there are no more questions i will reserve the remainder of my time 
 thank you mr fisher mr englert 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court it is not particularly unusual for the grants of authority in the fcc to the fcc throughout the communications act to be enforceable through the provisions of section N barring unjust or unreasonable charges classifications rates or practices justice scalia asked a question during mr fishers argument about what about the accounting rules would they be prescribed under section N they would be prescribed under section N which is the provision of the act that governs accounting and they would also be prescribed under the last sentence of section N which is the general authority given to the fcc to promulgate all of its rules but nothing in those facts would keep a violation of those rules from being enforced as an unjust or unreasonable practice under section N official 
 what cant what cant be sucked in under section N i mean once the fcc issues a regulation its easy to say that any violation of that regulation is unjust and thats whats happened here and this just makes a farce of the provision that says the only private causes of action are for violations of the statute and not for violations of the regulation it seems to me if this thing N can get sucked into N simply by reason of the fact that failing to obey an fcc regulation is unjust that provision is a nullity 
 well your honor first of all the fcc has never argued and we have never argued that all fcc regulations are enforceable through a private right of action i mean to give an example as 
 no im saying youd have to argue that if the theory you are propounding for this case is correct violation of an fcc regulation is unjust failing to comply with an fcc regulation is unjust 
 no no your honor the phrase unjust or unreasonable is a classic phrase delegating to the administrative agency the authority to make the determinations in the first instance of whats just and reasonable if for example there were a violation of the regulation forbidding giving credits to political official candidates the fcc could decide in the first instance whether the violation of that regulation rises to the order of unjust or unreasonable 
 so can every fcc regulation can be enforceable by private action all the fcc has to say is that violation of this regulation is unjust 
 no your honor 
 no 
 there are also examples of things that fall outside of charges classification rates or practices there are examples in the case law there are old icc cases in which providing a particular type of boxcar was deemed not to be a charge classification rate held not to be a charge classification rate or practice there is a recent dc circuit case involving an attempt to dictate in the ferc context to an energy company who can be on its board of directors 
 but at least at least any fcc regulations relating to charges practices and you want to interpret practices very broadly classifications and regulations for and in connection with communication service all of those regulations can be sued upon in federal court with all the diverse and contradictory rulings that that will produce so long as official the fcc says that the failure to obey this regulation is in our view unjust 
 well your honor lets start with statutory text section N says that there is a damages action for anything in this act declared to be unlawful section N says unjust or unreasonable classifications practices et cetera are declared to be unlawful so we have a very precise match in statutory text between N and N now what mr fishers argument amounts to is to say that if it is covered in a regulation it is exempted from being called an unjust or unreasonable charge classification practice et cetera because that would allow the fcc to enforce too much but if we start with the text congress enacted there is a precise match between N and N and to say that that which the fcc hasnt regulated is more subject to judicial review 
 i dont think hes saying that i dont think hes saying that if it is covered under regulation it cant be unjust some regulations do relate to justness and reasonableness but not N i think what hes saying is N established a scheme it didnt have to be this scheme it could have been some other scheme nothing in the nature of things says official that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable for this it rather was simply imposed by the fcc thats fine but to say that it would be unjust for them not to do that is just unreal unless you are going to allow any violation of any fcc regulation to be unjust 
 your honor our position doesnt require us to argue that it would have been unjust for the fcc to adopt some other scheme our position is that once the scheme is in place it is unjust to depart from that scheme in the way global crossing did just as once a scheme of rate regulation is in place even though there could be many different schemes of rate regulation it may be unjust or unreasonable to charge a higher rate than that 
 but the rate regulation is is established in order to determine what reasonableness and justness requires and N is something quite different 
 i respectfully disagree your honor N is asks was a delegation by congress to the agency to fill in the details of a plan to make sure that pay phone service providers were fairly compensated a phrase not very different from just and reasonable for each and every completed interstate and intrastate pay phone call they really fit quite nicely together as official opposed to being in tension with one another 
 is it possible i was worried somewhat about i think the problem justice scalia raised that old regulations become unjust and unreasonable and then i thought no but tell me if this is right that they are going to fall within N only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable now we could say and moreover the fcc has to find that a violation of these rates is unjust and unreasonable that is it has to focus on it make that determination and then of course that determination has to be a reasonable interpretation in other words it cant just call anything unjust and unreasonable 
 thats right the usual 
 and it has to focus on the fact that their doing so will create this private remedy in the courts 
 well your honor 
 that that if you have that tough which i havent seen anywhere but i mean if you had that tough a requirement so they actually have to focus on it it would tend to minimize the problem of a thousand different actions in ten thousand different courts and a big mess but i mean how much is written into those words official unjust and unreasonable im certain you cant squeeze any rate it is not the case that any and every regulation can be fall within 
 no thats right the usual chevron limitations apply and in your question justice breyer you added to the usual chevron limitations that the fcc has to focus on 
 yeah 
 well thats fine here the fcc did focus on it and is criticized for having focused on the consequences for judicial action 
 well but reasonably criticized for it i would have thought your answer would be unjust or unreasonable has for generations been given a very expansive reading and you dont need to say that the fcc has to do what typically i would have thought was a job for a court which is to determine whether theres a private right of action to bring its action within a boilerplate term like unjust or unreasonable i would have thought the contact point was what i was talking about with mr fisher earlier which is whether or not this is such communication service under N which is which is again i suppose something that the agency gets deference on but it would seem to official me thats where the limitation would come 
 mr chief justice let me address the interplay between N and N because mr fisher has simply misunderstood our position we cited the second half of section N not to say it applies of its own force here but to say that it disproves the contention that the communications services referred to in the phrase such communications service in N have to be limited to carriercustomer relations because N isnt limited to carriercustomer relations yes all N does of its own force is allow the prescribing of through routes and interconnections but there is no possible way to read N as limited to carriercarrier communications in light of the full breadth of practices covered by N so thats the reason to cite N is simply to disprove mr fishers contention about the limits on N the phrase such communications service is actually used in N and in N and the antecedent in the first few words of N the such communications service is interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio so N isnt necessarily restricted to either carriercarrier or carriercustomer relations but such communication service relates back to all official communication by wire or radio which is what we have here 
 well but wait wait wait it says to furnish such communications service is what says and they dont furnish such communications service to your client 
 no but well thats debatable but what N refers to in any event is in connection with 
 such communications service 
 right 
 and i would think that would mean such communications service that was furnished 
 well they have furnished a communications service to a customer not to us but to a customer so again this is connected with that communications service and as the colloquy with justice souter earlier touched on the caller pays sooner or later under the fccs regulatory scheme and in part because of the prohibition on advanced caller payment in N what happens is the long distance carrier gets the money and they are saying theres no private right of action to make them give it back in other words the world would look quite different without a regulatory official scheme but it would not be a regulatory scheme in which they get all the money they are currently purporting to keep now mr chief justice you also asked a question about the flash point on whether the fcc was improperly or suspiciously commenting on the scope of the private right of action as opposed to interpreting a substantive provision the private right of action provisions are N through N the provisions that let the complainant go to either court or the commission the fcc said nothing controversial about the scope of N through N the controversy is over the scope of N which is a substantive provision but once you have something brought within the scope of N after the application of traditional tools of statutory construction with chevron deference the private right of action follows automatically under N and N it is not a matter of the fcc reaching out to say we are going to create a private right of action it is a matter of the fcc construing a substantive term with consequences for a private right of action 
 well i think thats right but thats also why i guess i dont regard it as particularly helpful that the fcc opines on what the consequences of its determination that something is official unjust or unreasonable under the statute are with respect to a private right of action 
 well it may not be particularly helpful but it is surely not particularly harmful and they did have a reason 
 well except that it is none of their business 
 if they were trying to construe 
 we 
 N through N your honor i might agree but they construed N and commented on the consequence and this is quite important that it is their business because N is the provision under which each and every one of those commission proceedings cited in the sprint brief which mr fisher alluded to has proceeded before the agency N just like N requires a violation of the act so it is very much their business to decide whether these pay phone controversies state violations of the act if they dont the commission has absolutely no power to proceed under N which is the only provision under which any administrative proceeding has ever gone forward there are some arguments made here that they clearly have the authority to proceed administratively even if you cant go to court but mr fisher hasnt official identified the source of that authority and the sources identified in the brief are section N which has been problematic and others and other sections on which the fcc has never relied on in this setting and some kind of divination of an action within section N itself the question was put at one point to mr fisher could the fcc mandate feeshifting as part of this administrative remedy its going to create well if you read N broadly its giving the commission great powers to create administrative remedies notwithstanding N which was supposed to be the administrative provision then maybe anything goes but we are getting awfully far from the statute that congress wrote and giving the fcc awfully expansive powers to construe N while also denying the fcc rather mundane powers to construe rather ordinary phrases of administrative law unjust or unreasonable in N now with respect to the question of whether this is a practice in connection with a communications service mr fisher argues strenuously that it is not 
 let me just be sure i understand your argument on N you are saying that N like the earlier provision of the statute requires a violation of the statute not just regulations in order for there to official be an administrative remedy 
 yes justice stevens and section N expressly gives the complainant a choice of forums 
 so the same statutory requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges is the one he acknowledges is available 
 thats correct and in fact global crossing global crossing went so far as to argue before the ninth circuit that there is no administrative remedy that theres simply nothing to do except get fines under sections N and N and has reversed its position before this court 
 well you should be arguing then that we should give chevron deference to the commissions interpretation of section N and once we do that if N governs this thing then so does N 
 im happy to make that argument 
 i thought you should be 
 with respect to the question whether practices are limited to carriercustomer relations i have already touched on that by talking about the interplay between N and N but theres another angle of approach for that issue which is that in the louisiana service louisiana public service commission case this court was asked to draw the inference just as it has official been in this court from other provisions in the communications act that those phrases always refer to carriercustomer relations and the court said no that phrase can also refer to depreciation rules so its not limited to carriercustomer relations the inference from other provisions of the act doesnt flow and the reason is there are words of limitation when those words charges classifications rates or practices are used in those other sections that make it clear that they apply only to tariffed services you find no such words of limitation in N and N or in N excuse me now there remains the argument that theres a mismatch between section N and the relevant regulations because the regulations apply to intrastate as well as interstate calls and section N applies to interstate or foreign communications that argument appears for the very first time in merits briefing in this court it wasnt made below it wasnt made in the cert petition it wasnt made to the agency and thats a problem because the limits of the fccs ability to regulate jurisdictionally mixed communications depend on factual determinations factual determinations neither the agency nor even the lower courts have ever been given a chance to make official but had this issue been raised in a timely fashion i suggest that it would have been appropriate for the fcc to reach intrastate as well as interstate communications because long distance dialaround calls are overwhelmingly long distance overwhelmingly interstate and it is difficult to sort out which calls are which in fact the seven years of rulemaking the fcc underwent in this case largely were because of the difficulties of keeping track of particular pay phone calls 
 i saw that argument i have to say i dont understand it why is it so difficult i get a bill every month that easily sorts out which are interstate and which are intrastate 
 sorting one call from one carrier that has a relationship with you is not difficult or sorting N calls from a carrier that has a relationship with you is not difficult but when you go from a psp to an interexchange carrier to a switchbased reseller matching up the information of all three is has proven in practice to be quite difficult and its especially difficult in an era in which you cant just tell by area codes for example whether something is interstate if i dial N to N i may be dialing someones cell phone out of official state now the judgment below could be explained on the alternative ground that a violation of the regulations constitutes a violation of section N before i even get to the substantive discussion let me respond to the absolutely groundless claim that that argument has been abandoned global crossing cites a bunch of cases involving section N appeals in which people didnt appeal a particular order after final judgment and says thats an abandonment of the claim thats both correct and irrelevant this is a N appeal and there is no final judgment on any claim in this case certainly not on the N claim so my client certainly hasnt abandoned it my client was also a party to greene and lost greene and has argued the merits of the section N position all along on the merits section N contains rightscreating language that creates a concrete monetary entitlement focuses on the party benefitted and does not have an aggregate focus global closing doesnt even try to defend the ninth and dc circuits reasoning that the statute does not contain rightscreating language that leaves the tricky question whether a violation of the regs can be deemed a violation of the act itself when congress specified only the right but official didnt specify what fair compensation was and didnt specify who had to pay the compensation in that respect i think alexander v sandoval though its been cited against us repeatedly is actually helpful to our position that case says its meaningless talk about a violation of the regs separate from a violation of the act and that a congress that intends an act to be enforced intends the regulations filling out the act to be enforced i think the theory of chevron itself is also helpful to our position in this regard because the point of chevron is that the use of broad language constitutes an administrative a delegation of authority to the administrative agency not just to fill in details but to give definitive content to a statute whose direct content is less than definitive so it is perfectly appropriate to talk about this statute section N and its rightscreating language as ordering the fcc not just to create a plan but ordering the fcc to create a plan that has a particular goal such that violation of that goal can be deemed a violation of section N itself thank you 
 thank you mr englert mr feldman official 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court there is no dispute in this case that under sections N through N of the communications act a party damaged by any violation of the communications act may bring an action either in federal court or before the commission to obtain damages the scope of the remedies before the commission under the kind of standard primary provision of the act that deals with damages N and N mentions it as well the scope of the action before the commission and before the court is exactly the same now because petitioners therefore if well because petitioners failure to pay fair compensation to respondent was an unjust or unreasonable practice 
 let me just ask this is it the same with respect to feeshifting 
 no the act in N i believe its N specifically says that you may the court may award attorneys fees in an action in court it doesnt provide that theres no similar provision for actions before the commission but the scope of the kind of official thing that congress decided that a complainant could bring either to the commission or to court is exactly the same theres no way to drive a wedge between them there are other provisions of the act as mr fisher said where congress specifically authorized the commission an action before the commission for damages but those are those provisions which mr fisher cited are in section N which do not have to do with common carriers they have to do with automatic dialing with donotcall lists with things like that where the person whos violating it is definitely not the never going to be a common carrier in those provisions congress found it necessary to say okay we have to now give you the authority to create a damage action but in other provisions where you are dealing with common carrier N through N provides congresss determination of what the scope of a damage action should be either before the commission or before a court 
 do you have a position on whether or not chevron deference is owed to the commissions determination of whether or not their action creates or gives rise to a right of action 
 i think that 
 there are two different official it seems to me two different chevron questions the one is the deference on its interpretation of whats unjust and unreasonable the other is the question of whether or not they have anything to say about whether that means there is a private right of action in court 
 i think that i guess we dont have a position on whether N independent of N would be sufficient to have a prior right of action under N through N but as for N once the fcc does certainly gets deference has gotten deference for a hundred years for its determination of what is an unjust and unreasonable practice 
 but its never gotten deference at least i guess from this court on whether or not there is or is not a right whether there is a right of action to enforce its regulations 
 no and i dont think the fcc here is claiming that theres a right of action to enforce its regulations 
 well but they are certainly entitled to deference as to whether an administrative action can be brought under N 
 thats correct and thats why under 
 once you say that it can then a official court action can be brought under N 
 thats correct thats correct 
 so you think we dont owe them deference for N but we do for N and if you give deference for N N automatically decides itself 
 right but N like N maybe im not understanding the question both provisions address only violations of the statute 
 yes 
 so in order for the fcc to decide that theres an action either before the agency or the court it has to identify a violation of the statute here its identified N as being the provision thats violated its absolutely standard for a hundred years that i mean mr fisher says well you cant look at N and decide who is supposed to pay and how much they are supposed to pay that is absolutely standard from the very beginning of the interstate commerce act that you cant look at the words just and reasonable and decide whether a rate was just and reasonable or the practices that a carrier is using are just and reasonable in fact the whole 
 is your position i want to be sure i understand you your position on the two different questions that the chief asked you is they get official deference on question one and with respect to question two it follows from the plain text of the statute 
 thats correct thats correct i would add also with respect to the commissions determination about what is just and reasonable it was not just a question of saying that a violation of the regulations is just and reasonable the commission was charged here with the responsibility for adopting a compensation scheme that would provide for fair compensation for each pay phone operator for each and every call and it spent a number of years and a number of different attempts working out what is a fair compensation i would submit that all of that reasoning about what is a fair compensation scheme is also reasoning why its unjust and unreasonable for a carrier not to pay the compensation its not just simply a question of an ipse dixit its a question of years of rulemaking and working out what the scheme should be so its fair once it did that it didnt require a lot of explanation for why a failure to pay fair compensation that had been worked out over this period of time a failure to pay that was unjust and unreasonable 
 are you making the point that chief judge ginsburg made in the dc circuit that it is official necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a charge that is fair and reasonable 
 yes im really expanding on that point that it didnt the fcc has always gotten deference for what determining what is unjust and unreasonable under the act and it didnt require a great deal of explanation the fccs explanation here was more than adequate in light of its years of explanation about why this this scheme with these rates and these carriers and the primary economic beneficiary being the one who pays all of that were reasons why this was fair compensation once it decided all of that it didnt take much to say that a failure to pay fair compensation is unjust and unreasonable that was adequately explained and didnt require a huge additional amount of explanation 
 what sorry go ahead 
 so you would have a different position here if N said something like we think there ought to be more pay phones in order to promote investment in pay phones we are going to have this scheme in other words it has nothing to do with whether its fair or not its a subsidy then youd say that could be something thats not covered by the just and reasonable provision official 
 i think in that case also i would probably be here arguing that maybe if the fcc had determined that its necessary for whatever regulations they came up with under that scheme in order for the act to function correctly that they have to be complied with i think i would also argue that that was unjust and unreasonable but this case if the question is did the fcc adequately explain what it did here i think that all of the years of explanation of why something is fair are also reasons why it was unjust and unreasonable not to pay the compensation 
 are there regulations fcc regulations the violation of which would not be unfair and unreasonable 
 i think there probably are mr englert mentioned a couple i mean theres probably numerous ones that wouldnt be and in fact the question about most fcc action or at least a lot of fcc action regulations adjudications and so on most of them have to do with carriers obligations and most of them are things that have to do with whats unjust and unreasonable under the act and they have been enforced for years in the you know from the very early cases under the interstate commerce act official mr fisher also suggested that theres a difficulty with numerous district courts deciding these issues as opposed to the fcc well i would suggest that congress decided that these kinds of actions can go either to district court or to the fcc and in fact by making damages actions the scope of damages actions as opposed to other remedies coextensive did anticipate that there would be that result the primary jurisdiction 
 depending upon how broadly you think congress intends regulations to be sucked into the terms of this statute i mean your interpretation means sandoval really didnt say a heck of a lot 
 i dont think that thats correct it means that in the context of a statute that gives the agency authority that prohibits unjust and unreasonable action which was not the case in sandoval 
 yeah but you could say any violation of a regulation is unjust 
 no i think it is possible that the fcc could determine that any violation of a regulation is unjust and the fcc is entitled to deference for its determinations about what is unjust and unreasonable thats been official 
 so sandoval doesnt mean a heck of a lot all the fcc has to say is we think violation of this regulation is unjust 
 no i think the fccs determination has to be reasonable under the ordinary types of chevron standards but in fact when you look at questions of whats just and unreasonable over the years it is it has always been the case that the agency entrusted with determining that and getting the communications system working or getting common carrier systems common carriers to fulfill their obligations does have a lot of leeway in determining what is unjust and unreasonable in that context thank you 
 thank you mr feldman mr fisher you have three minutes remaining 
 thank you let me begin mr chief justice with your question about whether the fcc can opine on remedies all you need to do is look to what the fcc was telling everybody it was deciding in these order proceedings it was deciding and asked for notice and comment on whether psps have a remedy for violations of the pay phone regulations that is cited everywhere official in the briefs it never asked for notice and comments or considered whether failure to pay under the regulations is a violation of N so the question this court needs to ask itself is when the fcc by its own acknowledgment until now is simply opining on the presence of a federal court remedy whether it gets deference simply because it hangs the hook on a substantive provision of the statute now there are three problems with what the fcc has done in construing section N the first is that this is not a covered practice because i want to make clear our position its that the fcc has plenty of authority with respect to carriercustomer relationships but not with respect to carriersupplier relationships and thats what we have here on unjust and unreasonable i think we need to unpack two separate questions one is whether the rate the fcc chose is reasonable whether the amount of money that it said needs to be put into pay phone operators pockets is a fair and reasonable choice we have no dispute about that and we think that in and of itself could generate deference but the fccs determination to put the payment obligation on long distance carriers simply cant be shoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in official N because if thats the only reason why anything us failing to pay the money would be because of the regulations and you hear it again and again in their argument the fcc having concluded that long distance companies are the ones that pay the failure to pay is unjust and unreasonable theres no way to get there without the regulations and thats what distinguishes 
 thats not true you can say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your customers that you wouldnt otherwise make because if there wasnt a pay phone there they wouldnt be able to use your service 
 the fcc might have said that but as i said to justice souter that would be a very different proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that the fcc might have come up with when it was trying to encapsulate that figure which we think is zero but under your reasoning may be something very small but that would be a very different case two more things one is on the jurisdictional mismatch question mr chief justice you are exactly right it is not hard there are plenty of hard things in this case but figuring out whether a call is official interstate or intrastate is not one of them all you need to know is where the call originated from and the number that was dialed and pay phone operators have that information 
 what about the cell phone example 
 this is a pay phone case so all you need to know is the cell phone number and that 
 but you dont know the cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or he may be across the country 
 i think it still constitutes a long distance call depending on where the cell phone owner lives and thats still an easy thing to figure out where the area code is finally justice stevens you asked a question about the coextensive nature of the remedies under N and N we dont dispute that the statute itself is coextensive what we are saying is that N gives the fcc more than ample authority to do what its doing nobody has denied that and so we think that thats the place to look for the fcc to craft the arrangement under southwestern cable combined with section N the fcc would have ample authority to do that official 
 thank you mr fisher the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in dixon v united states mr jett 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in this case the parties agree that federal courts including this court have addressed nonstatutory defenses for almost N years and that congress in enacting criminal law statutes legislate against a background of anglosaxon common law such that a defense of duress was likely contemplated by congress when it passed the gun control statutes it is therefore required that courts apply defenses such as the duress defense based on the background principle of construction that the prosecution must prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt the government would have this court discount the development of over N years of common law that has produced a substantial wellestablished wellreasoned majority rule in both state and in federal courts that places the burden on the government to disprove the absence of duress once that defense has been raised by the evidence the development of the majority rule began with this courts decision in davis v united states in N 
 mr jett do i take it from what you have just said that you are recognizing this is a question of federal common law and not due process so that if congress placed the burden on the defendant there would be no constitutional infirmity you are just arguing that this is the federal common law 
 our our first issue and our first contention is that federal common law will govern the decision in this particular case but we also have a due process point that we also believe is germane but 
 you you then you think that congress could not say that the defendant has the burden on the question of duress 
 we think that congress could not under the the precedents of this court and under the the basic common law construction thats fundamental i think to the to the criminal law in this in this country 
 what do you do with martin against ohio 
 well we understand about martin v ohio your honor and we think that that based on recent precedents martin v ohio should be reconsidered the the significant issue is that duress is based on the fact that there that there must be free will and if free will is dispensed with in this case by duress then the the defendant doesnt have the requisite criminal intent and and in our and since the beginning of since before the beginning of common law in in our system it has been recognized that in order to have a criminal a crime there have to be two things one a vicious will and the other an act an evil act concurrent with the vicious will and 
 well there may be there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an intent element but there may be other crimes where it wouldnt and and i dont understand your argument to be is it that in every case duress negates an element of the crime or only in some cases 
 well we think that in that in every criminal case with possibly the exception of of public welfare cases that that there is an underlying background construction for our criminal law which requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt criminal intent 
 which is the easier of the two cases for the defendant a the case where the argument is a burden of proof should be on on the the state as a due process matter or a common law matter in an insanity defense and b in a duress defense 
 which is easier for the state 
 well either way 
 well we we contend that in a a duress is is different insanity deals with really the internal workings of somebodys mind so thats perhaps more difficult for the state but in a in a duress case you are dealing not only with the internal workings but also external factors as well as well that impose somebody elses will upon the defendant 
 i would think that its easier in you know we had we had a this term another case in which the argument is that you cannot have a separate insanity defense essentially and and exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the the lack of of mental capacity to to have that mens rea this is the same thing you are arguing before us and and it seems to me that if it applies to duress it applies even even more strongly to to insanity how can an insane person form the intent to commit a crime that that requires mens rea 
 well we we agree that i agree we agree that an insane person cannot form that particular intent we think that they are similar except that the duress case is perhaps easier for the for the defense because we have external factors that often bear on what the defense is unlike 
 but but we have held at least under the mnaghten version of the defense that the state that the burden can be put on the defendant to show that he was not insane under the mnaghten test 
 well we and we understand that and again our 
 and as justice scalia said and as i was considering in asking my question in your case we know that there was a conscious knowing and intentional in some sense act when when the person bought bought the weapons she says the intent of course was induced by by the threat it seems to me you have a more difficult case than in the insanity case 
 well our our we think that they are that they are similar because both deal with with the mental state and and then historically at least since since N in this court this court has said that you have got to have the vicious will in order to constitute a crime and so you have the same issue here did mrs dixon have the vicious will or was she acting under the will of someone else 
 well but doesnt vicious will mean simply the will to commit the crime 
 actually no it means the the criminal intent not just to commit the crime but having the criminal intent the vicious mind to violate the law mrs dixons 
 well what do you mean by vicious i mean that the person is is nasty that the person is antisocial or asocial 
 no 
 i dont know what the added element is 
 the this this court has has frequently equated the vicious will with moral blameworthiness that is the desire to do wrong that is the desire to do something to the free desire based on the the choice of having being able to do the right thing or do the wrong thing and freely choosing to do the wrong thing that is moral blameworthiness 
 the phrase justice harlan used in the davis case 
 yes your honor 
 but when you when you say freely choosing what you mean i take it is choosing with without consideration of pressure from a third party thats what you mean isnt it 
 thats correct 
 okay 
 yes your honor 
 but if the the third the third party may indeed exert pressure but i take it you would agree that it is still the decision of the defendant whether to cave in to that pressure or not whether to commit the crime or not to commit the crime 
 we believe that would not be a voluntary act certainly the defendant makes that decision 
 well i i dont want to get lost in in rhetoric here isnt it still the case even on your theory that the defendant in these circumstances makes a choice it may be a troubled choice a much more difficult choice to make than it would be otherwise but the defendant still makes a choice as to whether to cave in to the third partys pressure or not whether to commit the crime or not isnt that true even on your theory 
 yes it is true 
 okay 
 but the difference is as you pointed out justice souter that the defendant is not acting of her own free will shes shes acting based on the will of someone else that that person has overborne her will 
 it was her will to yield to the will of someone else i mean you cant blame somebody else for her making the choice 
 well we we would respectfully disagree judge she believed that there was figuratively a gun at the head of her children and if somebody puts a gun to the head of my child you can make me do almost anything that you want 
 that may be a very intelligent choice on your part to do what the person with the gun at the head of your children tells you to do but to say that its not your choice which is what you are arguing here the only question is whether that has to be brought forward by reason of of a defense of of coercion or rather whether it goes to whether you had the intent thats all we are talking about here and it seems to me you have the intent to yield to to the demand of whoever has the gun at the head of your children its a separate question whether the law should punish your yielding like that 
 well 
 but but you are telling us that you dont have the intent to to yield and and to do whatever criminal act that person tells you right that just doesnt i just dont think its true 
 what what we are saying and what i think that this court the precedents of this court have said is that you have to have criminal intent that is the vicious will that that the court justice harlan talked about in davis and this court has talked about in morissette 
 well what is the statutory what is the mens rea under the statute for the offenses that the defendant was charged with its knowingly isnt it 
 well on on seven or eight of the counts its knowingly well actually on the first count its knowingly but that is defined as as in this case it was defined as voluntarily and intentionally and then in the other counts it was simply defined as knowingly and so indeed that thats that is what the congress said however based on the the precedents of this court that even when there is a knowingly culpable mental state provided by congress this court has impart imported the the criminal intent to into the statute and so like in for instance in morissette which was a theft case what this court did was the congress had said knowingly didnt provide a a criminal intent so this court imported one and said that the court that the government had to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt once the defense was raised it became an element that the government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
 well counsel under your view how how is the government supposed to prove a negative in every case how are they supposed to prove the absence of duress 
 its really no different than any other case mr chief justice in in any case for instance a selfdefense case the government has got to prove that disprove selfdefense beyond a reasonable doubt once its raised they do it in the same way they do in the other case 
 but thats something that but selfdefense is something thats often a a factual element that you can discern from the circumstances of the crime the the other guy had a gun you know that sort of thing so if its going to be presented so its something thats within the control of either side duress is something that in this case the government would have no reason to suppose that it was even implicated until its raised and then they have no way of getting at what the particulars are because they are all within the control of the defendant 
 well we we would respectfully disagree with that and this case is a very good example of of that of that circumstance the government early on in this case they searched mrs dixons apartment and found evidence they they interviewed her they actually interviewed the abusers prior to trial before we gave them notice they they were able to investigate her background partially before we gave notice partially afterwards so that they were able to to investigate her and circumstances of her life but not only that they were able to call as witnesses the seven gun dealers from which the guns were purchased who witnessed the purchase and who did provide testimony that she did not appear to be under duress and they so testified so in this particular case its really just like any other cases you can certainly imagine a circumstance where that would be hard but in very many cases the facts are there just like a selfdefense case or for that matter just like 
 but i thought the gist of her duress defense was not that she was under duress when she was purchasing the guns but that she had reason to believe that her children were being threatened by accomplices or associates of of this this individual and theres nothing in the facts of the the scene that would lead the government to have any access to that evidence 
 well what what she was in duress about is she was told at the time that there was somebody at home with a gun who was just a cell phone call away so as far as she was concerned there was somebody there with a gun to the head of her children and she was in fear of her childrens life in terms of what what the government knew in this particular case the government had notice the trial judge required that we provide notice of a defense the trial judge required that if we said that if we had an expert we had to give the government notice of the expert and the subject matter of the testimony of the expert so the government was very well informed prior to trial what the defense was so that they hired their own expert who actually was able to interview the the accused without me being there and and so was prepared to testify about the issues of duress 
 what what is the threshold test that the defendant has to cross before the judge will give the instruction to the jury obviously the burden of production is with the defendant when can a judge say well you know this this is just too flimsy for a duress defense im not going to instruct a jury on that 
 well the the first thing the judge would have to determine is that has has there been evidence of each of the elements of duress and the trial judge found that we we have produced evidence of each of the elements of the duress the in in the circuit court cases they have not been consistent but we would we would suggest that the the standard would be that there would be sufficient evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant that would raise a reasonable doubt with a rationale jury sort of the the other side of of the prosecutions burden that they have to reach in order to get to the jury 
 what is the the methodology that you think we should follow in determining where the burden should be allocated under any particular criminal statute is it the the majority rule at the time when that particular statute was enacted or at is it you dont think its the the old common law rule what what is the at what point of time do we look at the at whats going on throughout our country 
 well i think you have got to look at two points in time and certainly we agree we dont look at the old common law because because theres been N years of of development of common law in this country since davis v united states so i think the court has got to look at at what the common law was at the time that the relevant statute was passed which in this case was N but i think in addition to that there there have been amendments to the statute 
 so the burden would be different under different statutes 
 well 
 if we were dealing with a with a much older criminal statute the burden might be allocated differently 
 no because i think the i think you have to consider that but the other thing youd have to consider is the development of the common law since that time and what what courts have done what the rationale has been that they have employed over time and in this particular case for instance we have we have six federal circuits and N states who have found that the burden of proof the burden of production should be on the defendant but the burden of persuasion should be on on the government to disprove duress once its raised 
 and you have N states and how many circuits 
 six circuits and N states justice scalia 
 no im saying how many are on the other side 
 on the other side of the circuits we count three on the states we count N some states have not addressed the issue 
 well thats thats sort of a horse race im im not sure even if i agreed with your theory that that what the constitution requires changes on the basis of an evolving common law of course it can only change in one direction right it can only change favorably to to your client favorably to the defendant it cant change to be more harsh to the defendant because the constitution prohibits that 
 we would agree 
 right so so we have a oneway a oneway altering constitution 
 well 
 but even even if i agreed with that im not sure that you know N versus N is is an overwhelming demonstration of of the new common law 
 but justice scalia its N versus N and but its 
 N versus N 
 but its clearly a N to N majority in favor of placing the burden of persuasion on the government 
 okay but are you making the argument that this number indicates a congressional intent and that what we ought to do is come up with a rule because congress intended it or are you making the argument that yours is the better rule and as a matter of common law which which it is our responsibility to develop we should see it your way which argument are you making 
 we are we are basing our argument primarily on on the common law that has been developed in in this country since really davis v united states through the present and has has 
 mr jett theres one piece of this picture thats different that distinguishes duress from say selfdefense if its selfdefense you take a snapshot on the scene you know exactly what happened no one taking a picture of these gun purchases would have any idea of all of this and the judge when asked to give to allow the defense of duress said its frankly a close call in my mind but when it is a close call better give it than not now he thought that the defendant would have the burden of proof perhaps the judge would call that close question the other way if he thought he was saddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of persuasion 
 in my mind it would be if its a close question i dont think the burden of proof in that particular circumstance would make a difference because it still is because he would then be taking it away from the jury and in my experience judges are are not want to take the questions away from the jury and they will provide the the jury instruction in a close case and that would be the right thing to do because ultimately we want the jury to make that decision but the but the judge does have a gatekeeping function in in a duress defense so that a judge in any circumstance if the judge decided that the evidence was insufficient to get to the jury the judge can make that determination so that you have the trial court acting with the the to make sure that what the jury is going to hear is is an issue for which there is evidence so i think that the gatekeeping function that the trial court would would prevent there from being juries making a decision on insufficient facts 
 mr jett a thought occurred to me by reason of your agreement that that its a oneway ratchet that when the common law changes in the in the direction of favoring the defendant it becomes the duty of the courts to allow that but of course it cant change in the other direction because the constitution would prevent it you sort of agreed with that but but if if you agree with that how can you explain our our N decision in davis which held that the insanity defense had to be proved by the government which was then overridden by a federal statute how could how could if if davis was right about what the what the common law required how could congress possibly have changed that by a statute i would assume that all of the basic elements of the common law are picked up in the due process clause why wouldnt why wouldnt the necessity of of proving the mental element of a of a crime even when that mental element is overcome by insanity why wouldnt that have been embodied in the due process clause so that the congressional statute would have been ineffective 
 well two reasons one davis was a common law case and and subsequently in leland v oregon this court said davis was a common law case and so this court can decide the common law issue with respect to the constitution 
 no im not questioning whether we could do it im questioning whether congress could do it whether congress could overrule what we did in davis if davis said that common law was that the government has to prove disprove insanity wouldnt that have been part become part of the due process clause if it was the common law 
 i think i think that if it if it does become part of the due process then obviously congress cannot overrule it 
 right 
 if it simply becomes the common law the rule of of the federal courts that this court has has established based on its supervisory powers then the congress would be able to do that 
 well it makes me suspect that davis was wrong 
 well the thing about davis that even though the the insanity holding about davis was overruled the core holdings of davis was not overruled and one of the things that davis said was that again to constitute a crime against human laws there must be the vicious will and secondly the unlawful act the other thing that davis said which was very significant is that the plea of not guilty is not like in a civil case where theres confession and avoidance what it does is it negates or it controverts all of the allegations of of the state and so that it controverts the existence of each fact that the state has to prove if it if it indeed does that and what duress does is it negates the evil the evil intent then then the government has got to prove that theres criminal intent its got to negate one of the elements that the government has got to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and thats that thats part of the holding of davis and the congress has not affected that with its decision on the insanity defense 
 may i ask if if you know whether congress has ever been asked to address this precise issue that we are debating today 
 congress has has never ruled on the duress defense i think a few years ago there there was a proposal to to amend the federal criminal code and in that particular it didnt pass but i think the result of that was that congress just took out the duress provision and said that the courts should make the decision as to how that would be handled based on on all the the normal considerations that a court looks at in making those decisions so that the congress has had many opportunities to rule on duress the congress just like the congress has said you have to have notice of alibi and just like they passed the this the rule about i mean the statute about insanity the congress could have have abolished the duress defense i dont think they could have constitutionally but they could have passed a statute and spoken to that but they have chosen not to and i think what that tells us is that the congress is probably aware of the common law and have chosen not to interfere with the development of the common law in this country 
 what about a defense that i was on drugs and and didnt know what i was doing because of that and couldnt form the requisite intent does the government have to disprove that as well 
 if that is a defense that is recognized by by the common law or or by statute then the government would have to do that if that particular defense 
 how is the government how would the government do that 
 well 
 a person just says i was i was on you know pcp or whatever and and i couldnt form the requisite intent 
 well the government could do that much the way they do like in an entrapment defense in an entrapment defense the government has to once theres entrapment shown the government has to disprove the predisposition of the defendant or prove the defendant has predisposition and so 
 but thats based on the defendants the prosecutions conduct the governments conduct in entrapment concerns how the government behaved 
 justice ginsburg it does but it still that case still deals with somebody overriding the will of the defendant the government imposing its own will on the defendant in that regard 
 but if the government is out there trying to achieve that result its quite different from the government having nothing to do 
 well we we contend that its still the same because its a third party whether its the government or somebody else whos overbearing the will of the accused and if theres no other questions id like to reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you counsel mr gornstein 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court for three reasons the burden of proving duress should be on the defendant and the government should not be required to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt first duress is an affirmative defense that excuses what would otherwise be serious criminal conduct when the government proves that a defendant has engaged in criminal conduct and has done so with the mens rea specified by the crime it is fair to require the defendant to prove that duress excuses that criminal conduct so that here the government proved that petitioner knew she was lying when she filled out the forms and that she knew it was unlawful for her to receive firearms 
 so there may be cases where the nature of the mens rea required would require the government to disprove duress 
 there could conceivably be such cases mr chief justice 
 the sort of crimes where where your culpability depends on your motive right 
 well if you had a crime for example that said someone who does something while not under acting under duress that would be an obvious example but there are 
 it would be an easy example 
 it would be an easy example 
 but there there are 
 good catch 
 what about a you know a hate crime a bias crime you know an act of violence done with a particular motive or intent and the and the suggestion is i didnt do this because of a particular motive i did this because they had a gun to the head of my children 
 right in in that kind of situation the facts that go to duress could also go to undermining the proof of the motive in that case and in that situation the government always has to prove the element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt but if the defendant wants to add to that a duress a specific duress defense then the burden of proof would be on the defendant to prove duress now normally in that 
 the government wouldnt wouldnt have to disprove duress in the hate case it would just have to prove hate 
 correct 
 and to the extent that duress undermines that it would be a defense considered by the jury on the hate question 
 thats correct justice scalia now the 
 how does selfdefense fit into this equation 
 the governments position is that on selfdefense the burden of proof is on the defendant but it recognizes that there are important distinctions between selfdefense and duress that could allow the court to reach different conclusions about the two defenses in addition to the point thats already been made about the degree of factual overlap between selfdefense on the one hand and duress on the other on the basic crime there are three additional considerations one is that the the circuits and the states are virtually uniform on selfdefense whereas there is a significant division of authority on the question of duress second selfdefense has always been a more favored defense because when the defendant acts legitimately in selfdefense hes not harming an innocent person but when a defendant is actually under acting under duress that defendant is still endangering or harming innocent third parties and the third reason is that theres always been a significant degree of judicial skepticism about claims of duress but theres never been that same kind of judicial skepticism about selfdefense so while we do take the position that the burden of proof is still on the defendant the court could take a different view on that issue and agree with us on duress 
 why is the number of decisions number of states that have gone one way or or the other on the issue relevant if its not an eighth amendment question 
 no i i think its just a federal common law question here and its only as good as the reasoning that underlies it but when you start to see a uniform body or a consensus of opinion on one side of the equation then there its much more likely that there are certain reasons that are underlying that justify it 
 what what if you are a judge like me who who thinks that any significant element of of the criminal law when the due process clause was was adopted remains in effect and it doesnt change with the times as you seem as your last comment seems to have said what do i do with a case like davis not a case like what do i do with davis davis tells me that this was the common law when the due process clause was adopted 
 no i dont think davis was taking the position 
 no 
 that this was the common law when the due process clause was adopted davis took the position that the common law had evolved to the point where on the specific defense of insanity that this was the result that should follow that there should be a burden of production on the defendant and then the government should have to disprove insanity beyond a reasonable doubt but davis was not a constitutional holding 
 oh i know it was not a constitutional holding but 
 and it wasnt a holding about what 
 i will have to go back and look at it 
 the early common law was 
 okay 
 because its clear that under at the time of the constitution the burden of proof on all of these defenses was on the defendant and that was also true at the time the fourteenth amendment was adopted the burden of proof was on the defendant there was some evolution after that now the the other thing i wanted to talk about with respect to davis is it was based on the understanding that the court had about the relationship between the insanity defense on the one hand and the mens rea element of the crime on the other hand and here theres simply no corresponding overlap whether or not the petitioner acted under duress she knew she was lying when she filled out the forms and she knew it was unlawful for her to purchase firearms so theres simply no relationship between the duress defense and the mens rea element of these crimes congress has also overruled davis by statute and we dont think it would be appropriate for the court to extend davis to a new defense when congress has rejected it with respect to the only defense that it applied to and and theres and certainly congress acted constitutionally in overruling the davis decision under this courts decision in leland and in other cases like martin and patterson which say that there is no constitutional problem in putting the burden of proof on the defendant for established common law affirmative defenses and 
 is is i didnt mean to cut you off 
 no 
 i was you have a tougher argument dont you when you when you face the comparison between duress here and entrapment because its its quite true in in entrapment you are talking about the actions of a of a third party which is causing something but the the ultimate determination that has to be made is a determination about the in effect the the inclination the willingness the readiness of the defendant to have committed the act and and yet i take it its its assumed that so far as the entrapment defense is concerned the burden is on the government so if the burden is on the government in what is a a somewhat difficult issue for the government to carry the burden on in entrapment wouldnt coherence suggest that a fortiori it ought to be on on duress 
 no and heres the reason the the burden of proof on entrapment is actually on the defendant initially 
 well the burden of going forward with evidence 
 no the burden of proof on the element of inducement that is there are two elements 
 you mean the burden of persuasion 
 burden of persuasion on the element of inducement is on the defendant the defendant has to prove more likely than not that the government induced this crime in the sense that it took actions that are likely to override what a innocent person would have done at that point the burden shifts to the government to show that this particular defendant was predisposed now thats consistent with background common law principles under which once its shown that one party has been engaging in wrongful conduct ie inducement then the burden shifts to the wrongdoer to show that its conduct did not have its likely effect in that case and thats why the government then has to come back and show that with respect to this particular individual that particular individual was predisposed even though we took wrongful actions that would have induced an innocent person to do this 
 you could almost argue that the other way i mean it it seems to me on predisposition that the defendant knows more about it than the government does 
 that thats true but again if it was just a matter of who has access to the relevant evidence then that would the burden should have been on the defendant that it wasnt just a matter of that there was this other principle which is that the there was already a showing theres already a showing that the government has taken wrongful action to induce the crime and thats why the burden shifts to the defendant to the government to show that this particular person wasnt predisposed 
 im not sure what the criteria are that i have to follow that we have to follow in deciding the case just count up all the cases and 
 no i dont think that the court 
 let me ask let me ask you this is is there any evidence that that we can take account of commentary law reviews to show that the government has difficulties in in meeting a duress defense 
 it there is nothing that i can point you to that shows there is an empirically evidence that the government is not going to be able to deal with this burden but what i would say to you is that you should take the same approach that the court took in the diana case many years ago which is it did not want to establish a regime that invites manufactured claims 
 well why is this worse in that respect and lots of things in the case that you have to prove may be hard to prove because it requires finding out what someone said to the defendant over the telephone what happened N years ago in a room where the defendant was the only one now alive present there are lots of cases like that traditionally in the law i take it its been that most instances where the defendant excuses his conduct on the ground he wasnt morally culpable mistake accident selfdefense entrapment not thats a different kind of ground this one evidence mixed but you have to prove lots of things where its really in the hands of the defendant and the defendant saying im so innocent because im not morally culpable i was asleep i was you know we can imagine so i dont see why this is different 
 justice breyer 
 and thats going back to justice kennedys question i would look i guess if we are supposed to get the better rule the first place id look is what did the model penal code think they think you should have the burden then i think has this turned into a practical problem in the N states that have had it for N to N years and you say we dont have any evidence to that effect now i have listed about four things here that id like your response to 
 let let me start with i go back to the diana case because i think the way the court approached the question in the diana case is the way this court should approach it because it dealt with the same kind of defense necessity and what it wanted it said this is a defense where there is a there is a big danger that this can be manufactured in a way that it is difficult to disprove and we are going to establish a regime that doesnt invite manufactured claims and that doesnt make it difficult for the government to disprove something beyond a reasonable doubt we have a choice here and thats not the regime we want to establish we want to establish a regime that makes it more unlikely that manufactured claims are going to come forward and that make it makes it more unlikely that if such claims do come forward the government isnt going to be able unable to disprove them beyond a reasonable doubt compromising the entire statutory scheme 
 but if we are thinking of things logically logically you are right i can see that this is in the hands of the defendant but i have wondered why hasnt this turned into evidence of a problem in the N states and the following occurred to me which i will put to you to see what your reaction is the defense has to do something if they are going to put duress in issue they have to get the defendant to testify so the prosecutor has something that the prosecutor doesnt ordinarily get he has that defendant right on the stand ready for jury evaluation and that is something a a prosecutor may want and its something the defense lawyer may not want he has to choose 
 but 
 so when you get into the practicalities of it i see things both ways and id like to find some evidence of whats actually happened 
 well take a recent case in which a defendant transported drugs from mexico into the united states and he claimed that he did that because someone threatened his family members in mexico now thats a case that somebody who has deliberately violated the law would find relatively easy to manufacture that defense yet it would be very difficult for the government to disprove that beyond a reasonable doubt yes but if the burden of proof is on the defendant then the government can do what you were talking about it can crossexamine that person and it can persuade the jury 
 if if does that 
 if he does that 
 he has a few other things the prosecutor he has that defendant on the stand there was an implication that you were in chicago at the time 
 if 
 where you on the night of such and such 
 there are there are other 
 and thats an advantage for the prosecutor 
 thats true justice breyer but what im saying is that its one thing to be able to persuade the jury through crossexamination that that is more not more likely than not its quite another thing to persuade the jury in that kind of situation that that defense is not true beyond a reasonable doubt 
 of course in the vast majority of criminal cases theres no doubt that the person did the crime and so the the benefit to the government is just carrying coals to newcastle the the defendant would plead guilty but for the fact that he has a plausible coercion defense and so he puts that coercion defense before the jury and oh sure he does let the the government crossexamine him but the government really doesnt need his crossexamination in the ordinary case isnt that right 
 in the ordinary case 
 and i i guess the only way we could really tell what the consequences are as justice breyer would would like us to be able to tell is to know how many people who have gotten off on the basis of this defense have gone on to continue a life of crime and and we dont have any stats on that 
 we do not have any statistics and of course when when somebody gets off it results in in an acquittal and so we dont get published decisions about that 
 we never know the consequences of our decisions by and large do we 
 well thats why this is problematic 
 im not sure i will answer that 
 i mean i dont have the experience as a criminal lawyer that allows me to say whether it would be one way or the other you are saying and i will repeat that is there anything at all i could look to try to figure this out because i think it is a question we are supposed to get the better rule what did the model penal code authors do did they take testimony 
 the the model penal code takes the position that every defense affirmative defense goes on the government and thats just a policy judgment 
 do 
 did they have evidence or did they have take testimony did they go around trying to find out how prosecutors and defense attorneys you know i dont know 
 justice breyer i do not know i do know it is based in in its explanation of its rule for all affirmative defenses which would include insanity which congress has rejected 
 doesnt that come from an underlying principle that your position is not entirely consistent with that is that the defendant is presumed innocent so its not as justice scalia may have suggested that well he would plead guilty but we are going to let him we presume that the defendant is innocent thats why the prosecutor has to have the burden on all issues i thought that was the underlying principle 
 the the burden of the presumption of innocence though only applies to the essential elements of the crime under this courts decision in in re winship et cetera and not it doesnt apply to affirmative defenses as the court has consistently held in martin and in patterson and in leland that is the it can be constitutionally you can put the burden of proof on the defendant to prove an affirmative defense and the constitution has nothing to say about that the presumption of innocence goes to all the things the essential elements of the crime and here petitioner benefited from the presumption of innocence the government had to prove that she filled out those forms that she filled them out with falsities and that she knew she was lying when she filled out that those forms it had to prove that she received those guns and that she knew that it was unlawful for her to receive those guns and it had to prove all of those things beyond a reasonable doubt now on the position of the states a significant number of states are on 
 before you get there what roughly speaking how much of the model penal code has congress enacted into the criminal 
 i dont think the congress has enacted the the model penal code this this court sometimes looks to the model penal code as one source of what is of of thought out there but thats all 
 who who develops the model penal code is that the american law institute that does that 
 yes yes 
 which once upon a time purported to simply be embodying the the general law the common law but it doesnt even purport to do that anymore 
 no it doesnt it doesnt purport it and in fact in this particular case 
 there are a lot of law professors involved in it arent there 
 well im sure 
 in this particular case the model 
 some judges too right 
 the model penal code said that it was expanding the common law defense of duress to a new place where it had never been so its not surprising that it would also have a different burden of persuasion than the traditional burden of persuasion now on on the practice of the states the court has never taken the view that it is just going to do a nose count and figure out what the best rule is based on the practice of the states 
 when was this the underlying statute at issue here enacted 
 im not remembering the the exact i think its in the N s though 
 well would we would our would our nose count be today or would our nose count be when the criminal statute was 
 no mr chief justice we dont think that the court should do that kind of nose counting based on whether a statute was enacted in N N N N and potentially have different rules for each statute we think that the court should look at the entire 
 well why not isnt it realistic to assume that congress looked at the state of the law at the time its passing a statute and presumably adopted what was the prevailing view 
 i dont think its right to say that it adopted the prevailing view unless it was a consensus view i dont think though 
 well a consensus view it would still be the time of the enactment of the statute is what would be relevant i would think 
 but i think the i think that the problem with that approach is to have a completely different rule for all the different statutes based on when they were enacted is unmanageable and impractical and the court has said the same thing in the context of mens rea requirements the court doesnt import into statutes the mens rea requirement that was in vogue at a particular time what it does now is it imports into all criminal statutes that do not specify a mens rea requirement it simply imports in a knowledge requirement that there has to be knowing action and that would be true regardless of whether its an N statute an N statute a N statute or a today statute and i think that the reason for that is one of practicality and administrability which the court has talked about in fact in in other cases the bailey case 
 mr gornstein just out of curiosity of the N states that have the different rule in how many of those states was the different rule adopted legislatively and in how many states was it pronounced by the state supreme court 
 i im not sure of the exact breakdown but i think that there are there are possibly something like N or so states on that have adopted it by statute but im not sure of the exact number of that on that 
 is is 
 maybe your your friend on the other side knows 
 is the test proposed by the petitioner that that you have to prove nonduress by beyond a reasonable doubt 
 yes after the defendant 
 and your test is that the defendant would have to prove it only by clear and convincing evidence 
 no more likely than not the preponderance of the evidence standard 
 more likely more likely 
 more likely than not and that the the court in the diana case actually in the context of forfeiture thought that a beyond the defendant should have to show it beyond a reasonable doubt but we and we we would take a step back from that consistent the practice in the circuits that have put the burden of proof on the defendant and the states that put the burden of proof on the defendant and the burden of proof that that congress has specified when it has thought about what the burden of proof should be outside the context of insanity 
 do you think a state could put a burden on the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt for entrapment duress insanity 
 for all of the affirmative defenses i think thats the the leland decision would allow a state to do that leland said that you could put require the defendant to show beyond a reasonable im sorry is it leland 
 clear and convincing 
 yes beyond a reasonable doubt and so that there is there would be no constitutional problem in putting a a burden beyond a reasonable doubt on the duress defense either and in fact this is a defense that congress could could eliminate altogether if it wanted to and just take the position that its going to these this kind of excuse would be considered along with all other kinds of excuses in either making a charging decision or or making a sentencing decision there is no constitutional imperative that there be a duress defense at all 
 what about the insanity defense 
 the same is true of the the insanity defense that the congress could take the position it hasnt taken that position but it could take the position that this is a defense that will be considered along with other excuses in by prosecutors as they make charging decisions and by sentencing judges as they make sentencing judgments 
 what about selfdefense 
 the the same would be true of selfdefense again that the the government no state has ever taken that position and the congress hasnt taken that position and it would be very much against all the traditions that are that we have but if a state made a policy judgment to that effect that this is the policy we want to encourage people to retreat we do not want to encourage people to take the law into their own hands but what we will do is we will recognize this and we are sure our prosecutors are going to recognize it we are sure our judges are going to recognize it as a a mitigating factor and that would be constitutional 
 mr gornstein there are some old cases that draw a distinction between justifications and excuses and you carefully use the words excuse to describe that defense did you do so having in mind that distinction or just as a loose description of the of the defense 
 i think that it it fits the defense and that you can draw a distinction between excuse and justification but i dont think the distinction ultimately matters whether you call it an excuse or justification its still the burden of proof should be on the defendant and it shouldnt the nomenclature shouldnt matter 
 what about mistake 
 mistake is 
 i thought it was a deer 
 yes mistake is something that negatives the mens rea requirement of knowledge so of course the government has to prove knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt and if somebody has mistake then the government isnt going to be able to satisfy its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
 and would you distinguish between instances of duress where it may a negative mens rea and instances where it may not 
 well if it does negative mens rea and this is infrequent but if it does then the government of course has to prove its element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt and if duress evidence undermines the governments ability to do that then the government hasnt proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt if the court has no further questions 
 thank you mr gornstein mr jett you have N minutes remaining 
 to answer justice scalias question a quick count it looked like that there were perhaps three that we could count but it was a quick count we cant tell whether all those decisions were based on state statutes or not the gun control statute was passed in N and at the time the model penal code had been passed in N and the eighth circuit had said that the law was and there is no doubt that the defendant does not have the burden of proving his duress defense so we believe that at the time the statute passed that the clear common the clear law in the country was that the burden was on the government to disprove duress 
 and three three was what three states that have adopted it 
 the statute by statute 
 by statute 
 now the government talks about that the defendant can manufacture a defense but you can do that in any case you can manufacture a defense for a for a plea of not guilty as to as to why you are not guilty so it really doesnt make a difference it would be the same thing for selfdefense in this particular case instead of ms dixon having bought the guns if she had gotten a hold of one of mr wrights guns and shot him she would have had a selfdefense and if she had done that then the burden of proof would have been on the government to disprove selfdefense beyond a reasonable doubt but because she did the less blameworthy thing that is that she bought guns instead of shooting somebody or killing somebody she is disadvantaged in in the courtroom because because she raised duress she then had to prove her defense by a preponderance of the evidence and its simply not 
 im not sure its less less blameworthy i mean if somebody has a gun to the head of my child and i have a choice between doing a criminal act that he wants me to do and shooting him you think its the less blameworthy is to go do the criminal act 
 i think rather than than to kill somebody it certainly would be 
 i wouldnt kill him id just wound him 
 well justice scalia i understand the sentiment but she was she was threatened by somebody with with a gun and her children were threatened and she might have killed him she might have shot him in either case though she is disadvantaged by the law she would have been better off if she had shot him or killed him and its simply not consistent that she does a less blameworthy action buying guns where nobody dies her children didnt die there were no funerals for her no funerals for her children no funerals for the abuser nobody dies but shes disadvantage because she doesnt 
 do you take into account that this was not something that occurred at once this was a longterm relationship there were many opportunities in which she might have when her children were with the grandmother say gone to the police 
 this was a longterm relationship but what happened in this particular case is the level of violence escalated substantially immediately before the gun shows the violence had been bruising where you couldnt see it suddenly it it escalated with a gun in the face and a split lip and a sudden threat to the children that we are going if i kill you im going to have to kill your children so even even though it had gone on for a while it suddenly changed and her state of mind suddenly changed because what was most important to her was the safety of her children and so she did what she thought she had to do in order to save her children and keep them safe and it simply would not be fair that if she had done the less blameworthy action that she has is more advantaged in court so you cant square the way duress is treated and the way selfdefense is treated 
 can the judge ask the defendant to produce evidence that there was no possibility to go to law enforcement officials and if she does not produce that evidence then refuse to give the defense 
 the judge could do that if he felt that that was was appropriate for one of the elements the one of the elements is you didnt have an a reasonable opportunity to not do the crime in her mind she did not believe she did because she believed that there was somebody at home with a gun threatening her children and im out of time thank you 
 thank you mr jett the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in jones versus bock and williams versus overton mr andre 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in these three cases each of the three petitioners filed administrative grievances with the michigan department of corrections the michigan department of corrections conducted investigations and issued final decisions on the merits of petitioners grievances nevertheless a year and a half later each of the petitioners complaints was thrown out of federal court without leave to amend because petitioners failed to satisfy on of the sixth circuits judgemade corollaries to the plras exhaustion requirement none of those three corollaries find any meaningful support in the federal rules of procedure in fact they contradict the federal rules nor do they find any support in administrative law or habeas law the two areas of law to which this court looks for guidance in interpreting administrative litigation and format finally the overwhelming majority of the circuits that have considered these questions have rejected them all id like to begin with the heightened pleading rule that the sixth district applied here the federal rules of civil procedure require a plaintiff to simply provide a short claim statement of the basis on which his or her claim will lie the federal rules of civil procedure do enumerate certain kinds of allegations that a plaintiff must plead with specificity those are enumerated in federal rule of civil procedure N but exhaustion is not one of them accordingly 
 suppose the district court finds that in its experience N percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted just assume that and the district court said the only way i can figure out the good N percent from the N percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite an order for a more definite statement because i will do it sua sponte under N i think can the district court do that 
 i think that would be correct and that would be consistent with the courts habeas jurisprudence 
 the court could ask for a pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion 
 i believe thats true 
 then why isnt this this is just the same if the court has said you know in order to make our screening function efficient we just have to know about exhaustion 
 well first of all when congress created the various screening provisions in the plra it noticeably omitted exhaustion it clearly had exhaustion in mind when it enacted the plra the term exhaustion appears in N usc N 
 how about what if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases why cant the sixth circuit do it thats my question 
 well what sets the sixth circuits rule apart from i think the hypothetical you propose and also from this courts habeas jurisprudence is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff the prisoner is given a chance to respond in the sixth circuit if they dont they dont satisfy the heightened pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial complaint they are out there is no leave to amend and thats what happened in this case in petitioner jones case he filed the complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies he said i exhausted my administrative remedies i filed my step one grievance on this date i received a denial on that date and he went down the list through all three steps 
 the briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisonerplaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion now do you think theres something wrong with those forms and if a prisoner fills out the form and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not exhausted is it improper for the district court at the screening stage to dismiss the case 
 with respect to the form i dont think that the form is improper but i think it would be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoners case if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of the form that asks him about exhaustion because exhaustion is an affirmative defense in both administrative law and habeas and theres no indication in this statute that congress 
 if its an affirmative defense then why is it why is it proper for a district court for a district court to have a form that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative defense 
 i think the district court can ask the plaintiff pretty much whatever the district court likes but whether the district court could could dismiss a case for failure to comply failure to respond to that question thats another matter 
 well we know under the statue they can dismiss a case because its frivolous right 
 absolutely 
 regardless of the substance of the claim on the merits if you know that you have just ignored the exhaustion requirement isnt that a frivolous claim 
 we would certainly concede that if it is clear on the face of the complaint that a prisoner has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies then that claim can be dismissed i guess the way it would operate and i havent seen a case like this but it would be where a prisoner says i didnt exhaust my administrative remedies and i have no excuse for failing to do so but please district court please take mercy on me and in that situation the district court could say theres absolutely no way you can possibly prevail on the merits so your claim 
 probably the reason they do this is that there are lots and lots of claims by prisoners in federal courts that are hard to decipher they dont know what its about they dont want to put the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single complaint when its quite a good probability its about nothing thats the kind of reasoning that would lead to a rule like this so and then you have the statute and the statute says indeed theres a special power here to dismiss if its frivolous or it doesnt state a claim or malicious so why isnt this just an exercise of the sixth circuits or a courts ordinary subsidiary rulemaking powers they are trying to figure out how to manage their docket 
 the problem is that it conflicts with federal rule of civil procedure rule N and as this court this repeatedly said including as recently as last term in hill v mcdonough the court will not impose a heightened pleading requirement absent an amendment to the federal rules of civil procedure 
 so your point would be that they can do this if we amend the federal rules if its a problem take it to the rules committee 
 i think thats correct i think thats correct but if it 
 if we amended the rules that way in effect it would no longer be an affirmative defense i mean by definition an affirmative defense gets raised by the defendant and so on so if we amended the federal rules in practical terms it would be like adding an element to the claim 
 right or if the court were to add plra exhaustion to the rule N 
 but rule N and the normal rules werent addressed to the unusual situation under the plra where the district court has an affirmative obligation screen on its own before the defendant even gets involved so if in fact just to follow on justice kennedys hypothetical N percent of the cases have this exhaustion problem why isnt this a reasonable means of facilitating the screening obligation 
 it may be a reasonable means but that doesnt necessarily mean that its permissible because congress had exhaustion in mind when it enacted the plra and noticeably absent from all the plra screening provisions is the term exhaustion 
 well but you just told me earlier that if it was a case in which exhaustion is required and not done that would be a frivolous claim and the statute does refer to frivolous claims so the district court or the sixth circuit has just said we know that in a large number of cases they are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the exhaustion requirement and we just want to try to find out which those cases are to fulfill the screening obligation which takes this out of the normal rule N type of case 
 right i think i understand i think it goes back still to the fact that theres not a clear congressional expression to take these cases out of the federal rules in califano v yamasaki we believe is instructive on that point in in that case the secretary of the department of health education and welfare had argued that section N of the social security act which used the term individual somehow took those those judicial review procedures out of the operation of federal rule of civil procedure N this court said no we cannot read the word individual as such a clear expression it may have been congresss policy to have individual claims be addressed one by one but you have to find that clear expression in the statute and that clear expression is not here 
 well what about N and which prohibits seems to prohibit a case from getting beyond the complaint not even to the answer unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits doesnt this clearly take this out of the normal pleading procedures 
 i dont think so justice alito we have exhaustively researched that language the reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits N and the only courts that construe that language are courts construing N and and they have universally found that that provision simply summarizes the other screening provisions terms so frivolous malicious fails to state a claim or seeks from an immune defendant and we cant really think of what what else congress would have had in mind because while its like the preliminary injunction standard it makes no sense that congress wanted a prisoner to satisfy a preliminary injunction standard before requiring prison officials to respond 
 would your answer be different if amendment were allowed i mean isnt the problem in substance here and i dont mean to dismiss your arguments from the rules but leaving the argument from the text of the rules aside it wouldnt be a real problem here in substance if the circuit bar allowed amendment would it 
 i think if the circuit were to sixth circuit were to allow amendment it would certainly mitigate the situation its our position that the screening provisions cant overrule federal rule of procedure N either but the problem we see with even doing away with the no amendment rule but keeping in place the heightened pleading rule is that we are talking about prisoners prisoners who dont have a lot of access to materials they may have legal materials they may have great difficulty holding on to their their formally filed grievances 
 mr andre didnt you have in one of thats cases that the exhaustion was spelled out by the defendant there was a complaint that alleged exhaustion generally but not in all detail then the answer attached every piece of paper that came up at all three levels of the grievance procedure and then the plaintiff said oh thats a good idea im going to copy all those documents and make them my own and nonetheless that case was dismissed for failure to allege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the record made it plain that there had been exhaustion the rule that you are opposing would operate that way if you dont allege exhaustion in detail it doesnt matter that the deficiency has been made up by the answer you go out wasnt that the decision in one of these cases 
 yes that was in petitioner joness case and that petitioner joness case is a great example of how the heightened pleading rule and the no amendment rule work together to result in a prisoner being unable to cure any problem with his or her initial complaint 
 you talk about the lack of statutory direction on the first two points but there is a very explicit statute on the third question it says no action shall be brought until administrative remedies are exhausted and yet you say the action should be allowed to be brought even if there are unexhausted claims in the complaint 
 well i we concede that an action that contains unexhausted claims or a mixed action shouldnt have been brought in the first place but its there and the question then becomes what to do about it and the language no action shall be brought its very common in administrative exhaustion schemes the americans with disabilities act uses almost identical language the immigration nationality act uses very similar language title vii 
 this is a very different statutory scheme this is designed to address the problem of an overwhelming number of frivolous complaints that result in the fact that meritorious complaints can be overlooked we have got a haystack in a needle problem here and if you allow the action to continue that doesnt do anything to reduce the number of filing of claims that as you say should not have been brought 
 i guess i should be clear at the outset that we are by no means advocating that a prisoner can shoe horn in unexhausted claims with exhausted claims so the unexhausted claims must go 
 well right but you provide under your approach no incentive for the prisoner to leave those claims out instead what a screening function turns into an editing function the district court is supposed to just excise out the unexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to continue 
 well its been our experience and from reading the case law it appears that prisoners dont intentionally try to shoe horn in unexhausted claims with their exhausted claims its typically based on innocent mistake a simple failure to understand either the particular circuit within which they are housed a difficulty in understanding that circuits exhaustion law difficulty in understanding the prison grievance procedures that they attempted to comply with and perhaps even being further confused by the fact that prison grievance administrators seem to apply prison grievance regulations i dont want to say in an ad hoc manner but inconsistently and so when they bring these complaints that are mixed they actually are intending to bring a fully exhausted complaint but then after a little built of judicial review it becomes clear that they didnt exhaust 
 why does it hurt if you dismiss the whole thing they could just refile 
 well it hurts for a couple of reasons well and it hurts under the sixth circuits rule because they did not allow prisoners to amend so 
 no no what would happen is you just dismiss the complaint so i guess again the reason they have these things is they get a certain number of complaints they have no idea what it sys to tell you the truth they dont know what the claim is they dont understand it there are a lot of things written here the person wasnt represented its hard to make out and for the judge thinks i have to go through all these papers i have to figure out if there is something here that was exhausted we know something happened it was something exhausted so the simplest thing is just dismiss it now the prisoner can always refile it with the parts that he has to now figure out were exhausted now is and it doesnt hurt because just refile it 
 it doesnt hurt if the 
 is that true or what happens 
 well i guess there is two different versions of the total exhaustion rule as its termed there is the eighth circuits rule with is with leave to amend so the complaint is dismissed and prisoner can file a new complaint without the unexhausted claims then there is the sixth circuits rule which is the most draconian of all the versions and that says the entire action is dismissed prisoner must institute a new action 
 why is that draconian 
 its draconian because by the time the prisoner refiles his or her action there could be a statute of limitations problem the prisoner may not be able to bring those claims any more in fact the fifth circuit in 
 does he have to file a new filing fee 
 not in the sixth circuit anymore and not in the fourth circuit 
 how many prisoners pay the filing fee in the first place 
 i believe they all do if they qualify 
 they are not entitled to ifp status 
 if they get ifp status all that means well first of all they only get to do that three times or to have three actions dismissed before they lose their ip status 
 is that a draconian rule do you think you have to have three actions dismissed before you have to pay the filing fee 
 no no no i mean but thats not really at issue in this case but even if they qualify for ifp status they still have to pay the $N filing fee its just taken out in installments and so for a prisoner who makes $N a day or $N a week it it is costly for them to 
 well i guess this is probably not a question for you but a question for your friend on the other side you can ask why does it hurt you can also ask why does it help what good does it do to bounce the whole thing back when you are just going to have them filed again 
 i think thats exactly right justice scalia 
 no well the reason it would hurt is because its difficult for the judge to go though this complaint that he cant quite make sense out of and it puts the burden of the prisoner to go through and figure out what he really wants to say thats why thats why its easier for the judge just to dismiss it than to go through many what could be many pages with a finetoothed comb trying to figure out if there is anything here that was exhausted 
 and the other incentive is if you adopt your rule the incentive on the prisoner is to put in every possible claim even if it is not exhausted because maybe it will get through maybe it wont and if it doesnt get through no harm he doesnt even have to pay another $N 
 but i think at least at least under that scenario the district court still only has to take one look at the case and then it can move forward it deletes the unexhausted claims so from a judicial efficiency standpoint i think the ortiz v mcbride rule out of the second circuit which is the rule that we are advocating is is the cleanest approach it takes the choice away from the prisoner it puts the choice with the district court and it allows the district court to delete off any unexhausted claims and in most instances 
 is there any argument that if the state does not insist on exhaustion or plead exhaustion that it just drops out of the case if the state resolves the case on the merits even though there is no exhaustion can the federal court hear it that there is general agreement about that 
 i think there is the circuit the four circuits that we know were unanimous that plra exhaustion is not jurisdictional and in woodford we know this court confirmed that and so to the extent that the plra exhaustion is an affirmative defense then it would operate like other exhaustion schemes in administrative administrative law and habeas where it is waivable by the other side 
 if if we accept your first two arguments then if there is no heightened pleading rule and you dont have to name the specific defendants in the administrative grievance that you end up naming in the complaint if you prevail on both of those then isnt the third question have you what happens when you havent properly exhausted is really not alive anymore in this case because you will have properly exhausted so why should the court go on to answer what would happen if you hadnt properly exhausted 
 respectfully justice ginsburg its unfortunately more complicated than that if the first question in the jones case the id pleading rule question is resolved in favor of petitioner jones then total exhaustion is a live issue because the sixth circuit as an alternative holding justified the dismissal of joness complaint on the total exhaustion ground and i guess on the other side if the court were to resolve the identifying the defendants issue against petitioner 
 but the sixth circuit obviously would have been wrong if he has totally exhausted they have gave that as a no alternative grounds but if they are wrong on the first one and he has exhausted thats the end of it 
 the sixth circuit and its not really clear from this opinion because its an unpublished opinion but the sixth circuit appears to have adopted the magistrate judges finding which is based on respondents motion to dismiss that jones substantively for lack of a better word didnt exhaust all of his claims so im sorry im not being clear 
 that was the case where the where the defendant estate wasnt that the case where they put in all the papers from the administrative record 
 yes but they also argued that jones failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on everything but his first amendment retaliation claim or what they termed his negative work 
 yes but they were wrong about that if if there was exhaustion in the case and if there is no rule that you must name everything the defendant that you end up suing if those two are established again wouldnt we be dealing with a moot question moot in this case 
 i dont think so justice ginsburg i think in order for the total exhaustion issue to be moot the heightened pleading requirement would have to be resolved against petitioner jones and the naming the defendants issue would have to be resolved in favor of williams and walton i charted out on a matrix and verified it a couple of times turning to the naming issue if i could since we havent addressed that the prison litigation reform act simply sets a floor of how much specificity a prisoner must provide in his or her grievance it does not require what the sixth circuit held here which is that as a matter of federal statutory law a prisoner must have identified every individual who he or she later sues in federal court this is a kind of endemic or flows logically from the courts decision in woodford v ngo woodford v ngo says that prisoners must comply with grievance procedures 
 you would have no problem i assume if the state simply requires that you name the individuals 
 i guess broadly speaking no in certain cases yes 
 to the extent possible i suppose 
 right exactly if in michigan they have a 
 then then there would not be exhaustion unless he had named the individuals 
 i believe thats correct i mean although i guess 
 so we may not be may not be litigating about a whole lot here 
 no right i think really the question is an x or not x question its does the plra as a matter of statutory law required individuals to be named in the underlying grievances and the plra is entirely silent on that question and this courts decision in sims v apfel lends further lends further support to the proposition that a federal court cannot go beyond what the particular administrative agencys rules require i realize that was a plurality decision but i think the petitioners win under either the plurality opinion or under justice oconnors concurrence and so yes justice scalia we agree with you that its simply an x or y question that down the road perhaps the court could address the scenario where a prison system amends its rules to require individual defendants to be named and then perhaps a prisoner cant comply with that based on the short previous filing deadlines and then there is a question of whether the administrative remedies were actually ever available to that particular prisoner 
 and you have in one of these cases the person has said i didnt know who was the person who said i couldnt have the operation until the prison identified him 
 thats correct i believe you are referring to either the williams or the walker 
 yes so even if you had a rule a reasonable rule that named the people that you know if you have it that would not encompass someone in two of these cases the defendants the plaintiff the prisoner said i didnt know who those guys were until they were identified 
 right and to that extent the prison grievance system worked because the prisoners provided as much detail as they possibly could and then the prison grievance system went out conducted its investigation broadened the universe of relevant facts and then made a determination they happened to determine that grievances were not meritorious obviously petitioners disagree with that assessment thats why they sued in federal court but the prison grievance system worked to borrow from the third circuits decision in spur v gillis a cooperative ethos between inmate and jailer was achieved because so long as the prisoner provides sufficient information for the grievance system to go out and answer any unresolved questions and so long as the prison grievance system avails itself of that opportunity then the claim is exhausted if there are no further questions id like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal 
 thank you mr andre ms olivieri 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court congress enacted the prison litigation reform act to deal with the flood of prisoner litigation that was coming into the federal courts obscuring the treatment for meritorious claims brought by all litigants the purpose of the act was to unburden the courts from dealing with this flood of litigation that largely was without merit the purposes for the act were to increase the quality of the litigation decrease the quantity of the litigation allow the states to address first the issues that the prisoners have problems with and to develop an administrative record to facilitate judicial screening and all of this would result in increased judicial resources for all litigation that has potential merit the invigorated exhaustion requirement does require total exhaustion the statute the words of the statute itself confirm this the statute states no action shall be brought until 
 may i ask you what is a typical administrative record that is developed in these proceedings theres never a transcript is there 
 i have never seen a transcript typically its one sheet of paper the inmate states what the problem is states what he did to try to resolve the problem before filing a grievance and then theres space at the bottom for response frequently the response is right on that page sometimes the response indicates see attached if theres a lengthier response there may be a separate page similarly if the prisoner cant put all of his 
 is there normally a statement of reasons for the denial of relief or are they just denied in many cases 
 for the most part they attempt to address the issue 
 are the opinions a page or two or just a sentence or two what is typical 
 typically they are 
 im just wondering how how much help that will give the judge later on in processing the case 
 in the last N months there have been N grievances processed by the michigan department of corrections at the third step and thats for people who appeal all the way through to the third step so there are many more than that before that some of the responses can be very detailed they can go on for a full page typewritten single spaced some of the responses 
 how many of the N are of that variety 
 i havent read all N but typically the response would be about a half a dozen lines 
 i see and the other question of the N grievances how many did result in litigation 
 last in the last year that ended june N th N months we had approximately N cases 
 N out of N 
 correct in the previous years we had somewhat fewer so its sort of going up but you know its between N N N this year we are on that same pace approximately N 
 can you explain what the disincentive or other reasons for there being just N lawsuits out of the N 
 these N are ones that we were served with that doesnt include the ones that may have been screened out by the courts and we were never served with them 
 i see 
 this only includes ones where a defendant was actually served with process 
 basically i mean you have heard the question and so forth it seems to me that my questions and certainly others were based on certain empirical premises that might be true might not be true so why isnt this a question for the rules committee why not go to the rules committee if this really is a burden and so forth rather than doing something unusual which is to make exhaustion something other than an affirmative defense to dismiss the whole complaint which appear to be rules that reached draconian results in a few cases anyway 
 when its a dismissal without prejudice its improper to characterize it as draconian 
 it could be because the statute of limitations could have run so it depends sometimes it is sometimes it isnt but my basic question here isnt this a matter for the rules committees rather than for the sixth circuit to go off on its own 
 this court in neitzke versus williams took a look at the previous version of the in forma pauperis statute and that statute allowed sua sponte dismissals for only two reasons frivolous and malicious cases under that in that opinion the court indicated that when its a sua sponte review for those two issues you dont get the benefit of the adversary process thats embodied in the federal rules of civil procedure congress recognizing that even in neitzke the court indicated that the federal courts were being flooded with prison litigation much of it meritless expanded the categories that are now subject to sua sponte dismissal and those include suing someone who is immune from liability or failing to state a claim 
 but that doesnt include failure to exhaust 
 it didnt specifically include failure to exhaust 
 and if you follow the normal rule that thats an affirmative defense then then the burden would be on the prison to do just what it did in the jones case why why would we say depart from the normal rule that makes exhaustion an affirmative defense when we know that the party best equipped to provide the information about exhaustion is the prison as the jones case showed so well they the prison had all of the grievances they had all of the responses and they presented that to the court so the prisoner is less well equipped to attach those papers than the prison is so why isnt it not only traditional to have exhaustion as an affirmative defense but makes the most sense because the one most likely to have the information is the prison 
 congress dealt with that in N e the waiver of reply provision which confirmed what the N e dismissal provision provides this is all a screening situation for the federal district courts designed to move these cases that have been proven largely meritless quickly through the system rather than bogging the courts down 
 if congress meant to reverse the ordinary burden on pleading exhaustion why didnt it put that in it was expanding the categories and it included failure to state a claim which had not been there before and it included if you sue somebody who has got immunity but it didnt include exhaustion so why should we read that in 
 well exhaustion is the very first provision and its 
 its not in the screening it doesnt say you screen out for failure to exhaust 
 its not specifically there but the exhaustion provision is a precursor its a precondition you cant even get into court until you have exhausted because it says no action shall be brought 
 but there are other provisions than no action shall be brought take a statute of limitations that reads no action shall be brought after two years or something like that there is no action shall be brought does that make it no longer an affirmative defense 
 the courts have interpreted statutes of limitations consistently to be in the category of an affirmative defense the problem with that is this statute the plra is the new regime for prison litigation not for all the litigation across the board and in the waiver of reply the congress specifically took the defendant out of the equation requiring the court to determine whether or not the case has been exhausted whether or not the plaintiff has failed to state a claim and the other criteria that are all in that 
 well all the criteria are there but failure to exhaust is not 
 not specifically but failure to exhaust could be construed as a 
 but last time and you said before the statute was there were only frivolous and malicious and the court says we can see from the face of this complaint that it fails to state a claim too bad its not a ground for automatic dismissal so congress said yes it should be and put that one in 
 congress put the screening provision as number one where you cannot even bring a case to court unless you have exhausted administrative remedies so its unimaginable that that would not be a ground for sua sponte dismissal when you cant even bring your case until you have exhausted 
 miss olivieri you also rely on the no action shall be brought language to justify dismissal of the entire action all claims even though only some of them have not been exhausted do you have any even a single example of the many other instances where that language is used in the federal statutes and there are many of them do you know any other case where its been interpreted that way so that claims that are perfectly valid will not be retained but rather the whole action will be dismissed 
 habeas corpus is another situation where there is a provision that says no relief shall be granted no writ shall be granted absent exhaustion of exhaustion of state court remedies there in the habeas situation it is a little bit different than in the plra pardon me because there is a stay in abeyance provision in habeas 
 right 
 which was in the statute before congress passed the plra and congress actually took out the stay in abeyance provision it all serves the purpose that congress intended which was to allow the courts to quickly screen these cases if you look at e they give the court many options for doing what is most judicially prudent in that particular case to preserve resources 
 what is the basis in the habeas context for dismissing the entire habeas application despite the fact that some of the claims have been exhausted is there any statutory basis for that or is it just just judicial efficiency 
 there is i believe its under the exhaustion requirement the court has the option of dismissing the entire action actually i believe there the petitioner gets the option do they want to proceed on the exhausted claims or do they want to drop out the unexhausted claims 
 and thats not the statute doesnt settle that our decisions settle that right so why should we deal with that the two any differently its not as though congress wrote the statute differently we said you cant proceed with unexhausted claims so you have a choice either you go out of the federal court and exhaust everything or even you dont have to go out you could use the stay in abeyance or you just lob off the unexhausted claims stay in the federal court on the ones that you have exhausted thats all made up by this court so why should the court react differently in the plra than it did why should it fill those gaps differently than it did in habeas 
 i think because congress did revoke the stay in abeyance provision in the plra 
 but your answer was it shouldnt i think i think shes making your argument for you 
 pardon me 
 i think she is saying that we should treat this area the same way we treat habeas so that the whole case should be dismissed rather than just the individual claims which is what i think you want isnt it 
 yes that is my argument yes 
 okay well dont fight it 
 okay i was suggesting that in habeas it is the prisoners option to say 
 i was suggesting that in habeas it is the prisoners option to say i dont want the whole case dismissed i will amend my petition so that the court will have will retain the exhausted claims you are saying not like habeas i dont want it to be like habeas because if it were like habeas the prisoner would have the option to stay in the federal court as long as he lopped off the unexhausted claims you dont want it you dont want it to be like habeas 
 i dont want the prisoner to be allowed to choose to lop off the unexhausted claims that is true or to amend to delete them because then there is absolutely no incentive for the prisoner to improve the quality of the litigation by stopping and thinking being careful to exhaust all his claims and being careful to plead only claims that are exhaustive 
 the same arguments apply in habeas dont they 
 but in habeas you have the stay and abeyance provision that was specifically removed 
 not if you had your way 
 remove well 
 i think you are making an argument that it would preclude that too 
 right 
 so it seems to me that if we accept your response to justice ginsburg we have got to go back and to the extent that we can do anything about it wed better toughen up habeas so that these things get thrown out more readily 
 habeas does deal with a persons liberty whereas the plra is simply dealing with people basically for the most part trying to get some sort of relief either injunctive or monetary relief that does not deal with their basic freedom so in that respect 
 one reason to require total exhaustion is because i would assume the prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are exhausted that he doesnt feel the need to go forward with litigation but i guess thats only true if the exhausted claims are still alive and how many when we are talking about unexhausted claims are those typically claims that are not going to be available or are they claims that may generate relief once there is exhaustion 
 it could be i mean its obviously both i mean there are claims that are partially exhausted when the inmate files the lawsuit he may finish exhausting and get the relief that hes looking for without ever pursuing the case in federal court 
 and then sometimes its impossible to complete the exhaustion i assume in some cases that the time limit for the last appeal will have expired right 
 that can also be the case and under woodford versus ngo now that they have to do proper exhaustion there will be more of those cases where it probably there wouldnt be anything left to do after its dismissed except for the plaintiff to be the one to go through the maybe N claimed complaints and call out the claims that are not exhausted rather than putting that burden on the court which is contrary to congresss purpose to streamline this system 
 may i ask you about theres another question you havent really touched on yet the requirement that the prisoner name every defendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting in the internal procedure id just like a little help on just exactly what happens the prisoner doesnt get the kind of medical care he thinks hes entitled to and he only knows it because either the low level person says no the doctors said you cant have it and he brings a proceeding an informal administrative proceeding and they deny relief and then later on when he wants to sue his lawyer happens to find out the name of the doctor who was involved and there are several levels of authority making the decision does he have to start all over again to name those people or what does he do 
 medical care is well for one thing prisoners do have counselors and so if they are not sure who is responsible for something thats one of the things that they are supposed to do is talk to their counselor to find out you know im having this problem im not getting surgery why am i not getting surgery who do i talk to who do i complain to so thats one way to resolve the problem 
 and what if he does talk to the prison guard and the guard says i dont know i dont know whos responsible for that decision thats in the wardens office or something like that what is the prisoner supposed to do 
 if the prisoner makes inquiry and just simply cant find out who it is then he should state that in his grievance and indicate that somebody in the medical department is denying me the surgery you know i talked to dr so and so hes recommended that i get it somebody is saying no i havent been able to find out who that is and likely during the grievance process he will find out who it is because one of the responses will probably say that 
 what if he doesnt one of his grievances is nobody told me is he out of luck there and i think there may well be situations in which prisoners dont have complete access to all the facts that go into a decision denying them medical care for example or say a prisoner has a religious problem and cant get the diet he wants or something like that but before he can sue under your view if i understand it he has to find out so he can name the people in his administrative complaint 
 he has to make a good faith attempt to find out and if he really you know if he says i have asked my counselor he is not able to provide me with that information then he will get a response on the grievance 
 what is the purpose of that requirement as long as he has made known in the administrative proceeding what his problem it and they have had a chance to investigate it and determine whether it has merit or not why should he have to name the individuals who made the decision in order before he can sue them when he later finds out who they are 
 that goes back to N e the waiver of reply where it says that no defendant can be made to respond to the complaint unless the court can certify that the prisoner has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits it talks about defendants there also you get a case like mr 
 well no its standard law of agency it doesnt make any difference the prisoner is denied his rights as justice stevens said there may be three or four different people who concurred do your rules say that if he cant find out with reasonable efforts that he doesnt need to or does the sixth circuit rules say that the delegation of the names is not required 
 the sixth circuit rule basically says name or identify and for instance here with respect to mr jones he didnt name the classification director he used the title nobody had anything negative to say about that we know you are talking about the classification director its mr morrison we have only got one not a problem the sixth circuit rule is basically name or identify so if you are going to identify 
 why is it that the sixth circuit rule requires the identification for complete exhaustion requires the identification to be made at the first stage 
 the sixth circuit rule does require that 
 so to make sure i understand this in a case lets say at stage one he names dr x and for whatever reason in the course of the response perhaps he learned that not only was dr x involved but dr y was involved in that decision so if he is denied relief at stage two he says x and y and he identifies x and why all the way through he gets nothing satisfactory to him so he goes in to federal court is it correct that under the sixth circuit rule they would say you have not completely exhausted because at stage one you did not mention y is that correct 
 the sixth circuit probably would say that that he would be out of luck with respect to y 
 what justification is there for that i mean for two stages through the prison administrative process y has been identified the prison has taken action on the merits on the assumption that y is in fact at least an allegedly responsible party what reason is there in a federal court to say that the exhaustion is incomplete because he didnt mention y back at stage one 
 the sixth circuit adopted that rule probably in a case like the walton case here where mr walton had a problem with his slot restriction and said you know deputy warden bobo put this restriction on me it goes through the grievance process and they say bobo didnt put that on you gearin put it on you thats at step one they give that response he goes then into court after exhausting two or three steps still saying you know they are discriminating against me based on race with the slot restrictions 
 yeah but that wasnt my hypo as i understand it in that case he keeps going after bobo period and in my case at stage two having learned something he identifies y and i so i dont see the justification what is the justification 
 i think i was probably giving too much explanation but i think from my understanding of how this should operate he is all right in that case to sue mr gearin who actually did put the slot restriction on him and he had the wrong name at step one no problem we got the right name at step two or excuse me at the end of step one and he pursues it i think hes got a good claim against mr gearin the sixth circuit may not think thats true 
 in my case you said you understood that the sixth circuit would say that although he identified x and y in stage two and at stage three and there had been merit for adjudication at those stages understanding who the named respondents were the sixth circuit would nonetheless say you had failed to exhaust because back at stage a you mentioned x but not y what is the justification if that is still your answer what could the justification for that be 
 i dont think the sixth circuit had that type of case in front of them when they issued 
 but that apparently if i understand your answer is what the result would be and is there and i dont want to you know make it hard for you i think you are having a hard time finding a justification for that result and i certainly cant find one can you think of any 
 im saying there is none im saying hes got a good claim against mr gearin 
 well how about y in my example 
 pardon me 
 does he have a good claim against y 
 y 
 in the federal court in my hypo 
 okay he named x and now 
 i think y is mr gearin 
 y is mr gearin yes 
 okay 
 so hes got a claim against y 
 even though the sixth circuit would throw it out for failure to exhaust 
 i disagree with the sixth circuit on that but i dont disagree with the sixth circuit in that when he actually got to court he sued four other people who were never mentioned in any grievance by anybody 
 how about jones who really did not know who was the doctor who said no surgery he didnt know and then the prison told him and he comes to the court he says thanks prison for telling me and so he names that person in his complaint the sixth circuit said thats no good he didnt put it in his initial complaint he had only N days to find out and he didnt find out 
 im agreeing with you that the sixth circuit both that the sixth circuit would say that that wont fly and that in fact it should fly 
 so jones did properly exhaust then if you just made that confession then jones properly exhausted 
 jones properly exhausted against the doctor who actually denied the medical treatment denied the surgery yes but jones never served unfortunately that particular doctor dr cranstall 
 counsel you have mentioned in your brief that there has been a change in the michigan grievance policy with respect to naming individuals what is the consequence of that change for our ability to address that claim 
 it will it will be the same basic philosophy that i have been stating here i mean its going to be a name or identify tell us who you have got a problem with dont tell us you have a problem with one person and then go into court and sue six other people who may be the people who actually responded to the grievance because mdoc didnt know that you had a problem with this person 
 i thought one of the objections to the sixth circuit rule from your friend was that this requirement of naming the individuals came out of thin air and now we have that requirement articulated in the grievance policy does that make a difference 
 it does make a difference in proper exhaustion 
 its not an absolute policy though it isnt that if you havent named him in the first administrative step you cant name him in the complaint thats not michigans new policy 
 michigan doesnt say you have to name him at the first step it says when you file your grievance you know name 
 isnt there an exception when you couldnt find out 
 and if they say they cant find out and they have made reasonable inquiry you know theres somebody at the top of the chain of the medical thats understandable that they may not know because they may have never seen dr pramstaller 
 did the sixth circuit have the current michigan policy before them when they made their decision 
 not on these three cases no it was the previous policy which indicated that the inmate had to be as specific basically be as specific as possible something along those lines 
 i take it from your answer to justice ginsburg that back in my dr x dr y case under the new policy if they got to stage N and y was identified that michigan would process the complaint 
 we would process the grievance absolutely 
 the grievance 
 yes yes finally i would ask the court to keep in mind that the entire purpose of the prison litigation reform act is to relieve the courts of the burden and the screening process thats set in place by this statute allows the court many options 
 now you say the primary purpose is to relieve the courts of the burden rather than determine whether there is merits to the grievances 
 the the purpose of the prison litigation reform act was to relieve 
 was to reduce the volume of litigation period 
 to reduce the volume to provide more 
 wasnt there any interest in determining whether the complaints have merit i mean i think you must be interested in getting rid of N complaints and reducing them down to N i would think thats more important than saving the court some time there must be you must have some interest in determining whether the complaints have merit 
 well we do have an interest we respond to every one of those in three steps and we never end up in litigation for the most part so the grievance process works totally outside of what litigation goes on it does resolve complaints but the prison litigation reform act allows the court to either 
 but these rules that are challenged here are primarily to benefit the courts not the profits the process 
 they are to to benefit the courts by taking resources that had previously been spent on meritless cases and spending those instead on cases with merit to efficiently screen these cases so that the courts are not spending a lot of time asking us for responses and so forth if its a failure to state a claim the case can be dismissed right there all without prejudice there is nothing draconian here they can be rebrought 
 thank you counsel 
 thank you 
 mr andre you have five minute remaining 
 justice ginsburg you asked earlier about who is better equipped to plead and show exhaustion its certainly our position that the michigan department of corrections or prison grievance administrators are absolutely better equipped to do so 
 how is that the prisoner is the one who presumably knows best whether or not he filed a grievance or not 
 the prisoner may know best whether or not he or she filed a grievance and whether or not he appealed the prisoner may not know precise dates on which he or she did so or have copies of the grievances anymore this really kind of brings the heightened pleading rule not just whether its just affirmative defense or a general pleading rule to the fore prisoners are prisoners they get moved around they get put in administrative segregation they are subject to repeat searches they have great difficulty in maintaining possession of their belongings on the other hand the michigan department of corrections keeps copies of all the grievances denials and appeals 
 this seems to me to be a stretch to say that the prison which has how many prisoners under their jurisdiction is in a better position to know in individual cases an individual prisoner what this prisoner did or didnt do with respect to the grievance process surely the prisoner is in the best position he knows what he did or at least what he is going to allege 
 he may be able to aver generally but with specificity there are many cases in which he wont be able to but the michigan department of corrections policy directive makes clear that it has to maintain these records for future foia requests and in many institutions it has to track them in a computer and as justice ginsburg pointed out in the jones case they were quite able to bring forward the proof of exhaustion that would satisfy that would have satisfied the court that jones had exhausted his administrative remedies jones gets just got thrown out of court essentially in a game of gotcha because he hadnt attached his complaint in the first instance i think most importantly from a judicial efficiency standpoint making exhaustion an affirmative defense makes sense that means that the lawyers in the state attorneys general in the state in the office of the states attorneys general are going to be able to put forward the best arguments as to why a claim is or is not exhausted 
 it requires it requires response in all the cases and as this subsection g indicates part of the purpose of the act was to eliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous complaints why why you know you have to go through the requesting a response from the government when in fact there is nothing to this complaint because there has never been any exhaustion 
 but to go back to justice ginsburgs point earlier congress could have included unexhausted claims among those types of claims that the court could screen out and dismiss or among those claims for which a court could 
 thats a different argument but i mean dont tell me that it isnt more efficient to have the prisoner say at the outset whether its exhausted or not it certainly is 
 or again it may be more efficient to have them aver generally but as far as having a prisoner comply with a heightened pleading requirement we dont think that that makes sense we are talking again we are talking about prisoners here 
 if its an affirmative defense doesnt that mean that the prisoner is going to have to file and the individuals defendants are going to have to file an answer in every case and assert all of their defenses 
 either 
 just respond even if there is nonfrivolous nonexhaustion argument that can be made they are going to have to go through all of that in every instance 
 they would have to file an answer and motion to dismiss raising whatever affirmative defense they want to raise but at least it gives them a choice and gives them the opportunity to frame this argument as opposed to putting it on putting that burden on the court moreover if the court were to adopt respondents reading of the screening provisions those screening provisions would swallow up every single affirmative defense enumerated in the federal rules and also those not enumerated 
 with respect with respect to the naming of the individuals is that claim moot because of the change in the policy 
 oh not at all i mean i cant see how how respondents could argue that 
 i thought your main argument before was they invented this requirement without any basis but now its an actual requirement in the grievance procedure 
 right but it wasnt when these claims were decided and thats where i think sims v apfel comes into play under justice thomas plurality opinion the key is looking at kind of the nature of the proceedings and if its informal and accusatorial as opposed to adversarial then a court cannot impose a requirement beyond that which the agency itself required at the time that the claims were before the agency under justice oconnors concurrence she was concerned about fair notice and certainly here in these cases petitioners williams and walton didnt have fair notice that a year and a half later the state of michigan after going through the entire grievance procedure and never relying on their failure to be sufficiently specific can then come into federal court and say aha 
 future prisoners now do have fair notice because the grievance procedure says name the individuals dates names places names of all those all involved 
 yes they would they would and again there would certainly be constraints to too rigid enforcement of that particular provision 
 is the no leeway built into the rule itself that if you dont know 
 im sorry i didnt 
 isnt there the current rule isnt there some leeway for cases where the prisoner simply doesnt know the names 
 im not aware of any justice ginsburg 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in norfolk southern railway versus sorrell mr phillips 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the fundamental question in this case is whether the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the fela the doctrine of equivalence is i think most clearly stated in the restatement of torts which is reproduced on page N of our blue brief in the middle paragraph and i think it is worth taking a second to read it the rules which determine the causal relation between a plaintiffs negligent conduct and the harm resulting to him are the same as those determining the causal relation between the defendants negligent conduct and resulting harm to others that is a principle of law that has been in effect long before the federal employers liability act was enacted it is obviously a restatement of the law in N and it is an absolutely clear official statement of the law as it applies today there is nothing in the federal employers liability act that remotely modifies the doctrine of equivalence the two provisions section N talks about negligence resulting from or negligence in whole or in part and section N which describes the contributory negligence portion or comparative negligence talks about negligence attributable to none of that deviates at all from any kind of common law doctrines negligence inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation 
 except that the what was it the rogers case which said that the well you debate whether it said that but lets assume that it said that the rule of proximate causality doesnt apply to the negligence of the defendant the basis for that holding was that in whole or in part language which is used for the negligence of the defendant but not used for the contributory negligence so if you believe that that case was at least decided for the right reason it seems to me theres a good argument that it changed it for the one but not for the other 
 well even if that were true we would still of course be entitled to i mean it doesnt change the doctrine of equivalence it doesnt say that we are not entitled to the same rule with respect official to the our clients 
 but nobody does 
 the plaintiff would be that doctrine is unaffected by that holding now id like to take issue with the interpretation of rogers if you want at this point but it seems to me the doctrine of equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine of proximate causation and therefore you can change one without affecting the other one whatsoever 
 mr phillips the fundamental problem at least for me in this case is that there was no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the judge gave on negligence there was an instruction requested by the defendant on contributory negligence which read such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injury that was the only instruction objected to because the refusal to give that instruction but you seem to be using that as a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which no objection was made 
 thats not our attack justice ginsburg our objection which is reproduced in N a of the cert of the petitions appendix that says and i think the current mai instruction has a different causation standard for comparative fault meaning that official under missouris rules we must prove that such negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause to cause the injury and that misstates the law because of the doctrine of equivalence thats our initial argument is that no matter how you analyze this whether you do it from a proximate cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate way to evaluate our negligence that same standard has to be applied in evaluating the plaintiffs negligence thats the core doctrine thats what we sought certiorari on the argument with respect to rogers was not an argument we put into this case justice ginsburg its an argument that the respondent put into this case 
 i take it you would be satisfied not wholly satisfied but substantially satisfied if we said yeah we accept the doctrine of equivalence and we think the instruction on contributory negligence was correct because that would mean in the next case you would get a proximate cause instruction on defendants negligence 
 we would regard that as certainly at least half a loaf maybe more than half a loaf but at the end of the day i think the right answer in this case is that the court ought to go ahead and decide official whether or not rogers really did work a sea change in the law 
 if we came out the way i just described 
 you wouldnt have to address that issue 
 we wouldnt have to 
 absolutely dont have to address that issue on the other hand the question is squarely presented and 
 but i thought you argued the rogers standard was a correct standard in the missouri court 
 we clearly did that justice kennedy and we didnt raise we are not here complaining about rogers as an argument for why we shouldnt be liable thats not our we are not criticizing that what we are saying is in response to the respondents argument which seeks to undermine the doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading i would argue of rogers that that interpretation is incorrect and if we are right that that interpretation is incorrect we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two different reasons official the first one that justice souter described and the second one would be that to the extent that theres any equivalence theres no problem here because proximate cause is required in every case and we think that thats an issue that the court doesnt have to decide but certainly could im sorry your honor 
 mr phillips the defendant requested a charge on contributory negligence that read such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injuries you didnt want the direct relationship you didnt ask for that you asked for one that said such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to his injury now you are saying that that was what you asked for was an incorrect charge 
 no what we are saying justice ginsburg is that we were entitled to the same if they were going to use slight negligence with respect to our negligence then with respect to the plaintiffs negligence we were entitled to slight negligence as well thats our fundamental argument thats the issue we have put on the table and candidly i dont think theres an answer to that thats been offered in this case other than a harmless error argument which i think is candidly without substance official the issue then is whether in evaluating the doctrine of equivalence do you want to then entertain the plaintiffs or the respondents counter argument which is that somehow rogers requires this fundamental change and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence as it applies to fela and i would say one rogers doesnt speak to the doctrine of equivalence at all and two to the extent it does speak to it it was never meant to change the fundamental rule with respect to proximate causation 
 except we have rejected petitions for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times eleven circuits are in agreement as to what rogers required you 
 well at least one circuit clearly 
 do you really expect to get five votes for the railroad on this what would be a massive change of what is assumed to be the law for what N years 
 well i think the well the answer is yes of course i expect to get five votes for that 
 but you were wise enough not to ask for that official 
 but you know the basic the point here is that if you look at the decisions that have analyzed this courts opinion in rogers i dont think any of them has analyzed it with much care and the reality is the third circuit has analyzed this case with care and reached the opposite conclusion we think there is a split in the circuits and at some point if not through this vehicle to address that issue then through another vehicle to address that issue but yes it seems reasonably clear that first of all there were at least N decisions of this court dealing not only with the sufficiency evidence but also with the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to rogers that refer specifically to proximate causation there is nothing in the statute that remotely meant to change that there is nothing thats been identified in that context it is at least clear to me and i hope clear to five of you 
 rogers said in whole or in part now i agree with you that i dont see how that does it but rogers said that it did it 
 but what rogers saying in whole or in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation standard existing in missouri and missouris proximate cause standard talked about sole causation and this official court said no in whole or in part means sole causation can not be the right standard for proximate cause the court was not asked to decide and i dont think it did decide that proximate causation as it is traditionally understood was also thrown out the door or more fundamentally that you can never ask for a jury instruction that calls for proximate causation to be given to both parties im sorry 
 mr phillips i may be lost a bit here but i mean which im looking at the instructions that were given and it seems to me it is hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroads part because it tracks the statutory language the statute says in whole or in part and the instruction says in whole or in part so if you are pushing the doctrine of equivalence your objection seems to be to the directly contributed language with respect to the employee the plaintiff now but doesnt directly contributed isnt that a typical proximate cause instruction 
 yes that is a typical proximate cause instruction and that meant that our burden was heavier than the plaintiffs burden which is why we are saying that under the doctrine of equivalence we are entitled to the equivalent instructions whatever they official are if it is slight cause or proximate cause 
 right but on the other hand you are also arguing in favor of proximate cause you are saying rogers didnt change proximate cause 
 right but we are only doing that in response to the respondents argument im not we didnt bring to this court an affirmative argument that said we are entitled to no liability because of proximate cause thats not the argument we made the argument 
 how is the blue brief in response to respondents argument 
 because if you look at the opposition to the cert petition which took us to task for not discussing rogers in our petition it says on page N inexplicably petitioner does not cite let alone discuss rogers an omission that enfeebles its entire discussion of felas causation standards against that kind of an attack we felt it incumbent on us to deal with rogers 
 as we are supposed to decide the case in your view there was instruction N instruction N used the word direct 
 yes 
 you object to N you said it should use the word in whole or in part official 
 yes 
 you then argued to the lower courts N should use the word in whole or in part and then you say you have argued that here so what you are saying is now we are supposed to decide should instruction N use the word in whole or in part thats what it is i have to admit i didnt quite get that out of the blue brief i thought you were arguing something else about railroad negligence but you are not now you say arguing about railroad negligence you are arguing about plaintiff negligence 
 right we are arguing both 
 all right so if i reread the blue brief what i will discover on closer examination that your real objection not responding to the other side has simply been about the standard to use in respect to plaintiffs contributory negligence and what you want this court to say is you are right about that we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory negligence end of case 
 right 
 yes 
 yes 
 it says that in the blue brief official 
 yes it does say that in the blue brief because what we say is that the doctrine of equivalence is the principle that should apply and you know it is not specifically before the court whether that means slight cause or proximate cause 
 i would say it sure is before the court because what we are considering before the court is your objection to instruction N and you said it should use the words in whole or in part and i have to admit i dont know why it shouldnt but i will have to ask them that 
 thats fair 
 you are going to say yes so all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether the railroad standard of negligence the railroad should be in a relaxed standard of negligence in whole or in part 
 well i dont know that its 
 causation 
 i dont know that its extraneous it clearly is not something that the court needs to decide on the other hand it is something that the respondents to my mind at least put into the case and then we responded to be sure somewhat aggressively in urging the court to rethink whether rogers was right official whether rogers really decided this issue as some courts of appeals have 
 perhaps my memory is faulty but as i recall your opening brief many pages were devoted to what instruction should have been given on railroad negligence you were dealing not simply with what seems to be the question presented that is was the instruction on contributory negligence wrong because it said it didnt use the in whole or in part language instead it said directly caused so thats the limit of what we can deal with whether the in whole or in part should have been in the contributory negligence but it was your brief that spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for the railroads negligence 
 there is no question about that justice ginsburg but the point is that we made both arguments and they are in some ways intertwined in part because so much of the doctrine of equivalence itself is based on proximate cause as the standard and so if you go back and look at all of the common law analyses here which are the predicate 
 but you didnt object to the charge that was given on negligence you didnt object to the in whole or in part so that should be out of the official case 
 except to the extent that the respondents are asking you to interpret rogers as a mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence now it seems to me you can answer that in one of two ways you can say simply as i said to justice scalia rogers doesnt speak to the doctrine of equivalence and therefore you dont have to entertain that you should just reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the courts in missouri have recognized for a very long time or alternatively you can say well look they say that in order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence you should examine whether or not rogers worked a sea change in the law and we took them up on that argument and said we dont think it did and that if it didnt work a sea change in the law then there is no basis at all for doubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in these two cases and thats the guidance you would give to the lower courts on remand because this case would have to go back for a new trial 
 you are not taking them up on any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about what the proper standard was for the railroads official negligence 
 and i would add to that that we dont usually look at a bio to see the issues that the petitioner is presenting 
 and you know justice kennedy i understand that but the reality is we raised the doctrine of equivalence as our question presented the other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its pages for the issue of the meaning of rogers we answer that in the reply brief the court grants certiorari we decided under those circumstances that the sensible way to proceed was to address the rogers issue now to be sure i suppose we could have said heres section one is the doctrine of equivalence thats a N page brief maybe the better way to do it is just write a N page brief wait for their N page brief on rogers and then N pages on rogers but we anticipated that they were going to do precisely what they did which is 
 so you would have us announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence without saying which way it should be made equivalent raising the railroads standard or lowering the employees 
 well because courts of appeals official have been doing that for years there have been a lot you know a lot of them assume that theres a lower standard and they say that the doctrine of equivalence requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight cause then the defendant gets slight cause so thats a ruling thats been rendered for years and years is that the most sensible way i dont know i think it would make sense for this court to address the more fundamental issue of rogers because i think it is an important issue that needs to be decided i dont think the court needs to decide it i do think it has been thoroughly vetted for the court on both sides and it would certainly provide significant guidance to the lower courts 
 mr phillips may i ask you this question assuming you are right on the doctrine of equivalence and you are wrong on proximate cause for the moment now you said earlier in your argument it is perfectly clear there was no harmless error here 
 yes 
 it seemed to me that a possible interpretation of the record and id like you to comment of the record is that the jury either believed the one one truck driver or the other and that the direct causation thing really didnt have an impact on the calculation of official damages and i was going to ask you to comment on that and to tell me whether during the argument of the case before the jury did the plaintiffs lawyer argue in effect that he had the railroad has a much heavier burden of proving a causation than we do 
 let me take the first question first and then i will address the second one there were three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the negligence of the railroad not just that the one driver drove the other driver off the side of the road there was also a claim that the road wasnt constructed properly and there was a claim that he wasnt given adequate safety instructions and theres no way given that this was a general verdict to remotely figure out which of those theories was the one the jury thought was correct and how that theory might line up with a causation theory based on the plaintiffs own particular view and the defendants arguments in this particular case so it is not as cut and dried as he said he said and thats it they were more theories in it and you know if you accept the idea that jury instructions count and theres clearly a very different burden thats imposed on one as opposed to the other then it seems to official me the answer is theres no way for the court to make a harmless error determination it is also a question of state law it ought to be decided by the missouri courts in the first instance in any event i would think rather than this court trying to sort through the record with respect to the argument at the close of the case i dont remember any specific arguments that either side made with respect to the burdens because the jury instructions were what they were and i think each side was saying you know we really didnt do anything wrong and so thats basically the way that it was presented but i think given the way the jury instructions played out that theres no way at this time to unscramble that 
 i think im seeing now i think the structure of your brief is perhaps a gloss put on it but saying this look we objected to the contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it couldnt be different from the direct instruction from the railroad instruction and we said they should be the same and they should both be in whole or in part 
 correct 
 and we now want you to say that official the refusal of the court to do that was wrong because it violated the equivalence but as soon as you do that you are going to have to think about what the right standard should be for a new trial 
 right 
 and if you stop there probably they will put the in whole or in part but thats not the right standard 
 correct 
 and if you really think about it you will see that the one we didnt ask for but the one that the court gave is the right standard and should have been given in the other case too now we wouldnt have to say that 
 right 
 but you are saying unless you say that you are not going to give proper instruction to what happens in the future now 
 you know thats 
 now lets think back for a minute on the merits 
 im sorry 
 how could it be wrong how could it be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole or in part language for the railroad since thats the official language of the statute itself 
 well i think if we were entitled to go back to the trial court and if the issue was whats the proper instruction we would have asked for and we should have properly received a proximate cause instruction and thats what thats the question that will be at issue on the remand 
 what possible you have two sides one you write a proximate cause instruction in whatever language you like 
 right 
 the other side submits a proposed instruction with in whole or in part im a trial judge i have never heard of this case kind of case before i just was appointed i read the statute and i say well here theirs says what the statute says and yours doesnt i will play it safe i will go with the statute all right now how could that be an error 
 well it is not a correct statement of the law 
 all right 
 is the answer 
 in other words what the statute said it is not a correct statement of the law 
 well because it doesnt adequately official explain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go through in order to evaluate this case i mean it is true it is not an incorrect statement in the sense that theres nothing wrong with it but it is not an adequate statement because it doesnt deal it is not sufficient it doesnt deal with the proximate cause issue i mean it seems to me 
 mr phillips may i interrupt on exactly the point that i think you are addressing with justice breyer as i understand your argument you are saying one view of rogers is that the in whole or in part language eliminates the proximate cause instruction we all agree that that is one view of rogers 
 right 
 but it also does something else and i dont think we disagree about that either it specifically instructs the jury that multiple causation may be present and if it is if the defendant is at least one the source of one of those causes under rogers even slightly 
 right 
 that that will suffice the problem i have with in a way with your response to justice breyer and the problem that i have with the instruction that your side requested on contributory official negligence is this it seems to me that the in whole or in part language would be wrong on contributory negligence or at least it would be very misleading for the simple reason that you never get to contributory negligence unless you found the defendant was negligent in the first place 
 right 
 and therefore if the plaintiff is also negligent it will necessarily be in part it couldnt be wholly or in part if it were wholly negligent you would never have found the defendant was negligent in the first place 
 i 
 so that to the extent the instruction addresses multiple causation it would be misleading to the jury and it would assume a possibility that couldnt happen therefore if you are not going to mislead the jury on multiple causation when you instruct on contributory negligence you have got to have some other way of addressing the proximate cause language is that analysis right or wrong 
 well i think it is wrong on two levels one is i dont know why you would need to have proximate cause as your fallback the last comment you just made because it seems to me if you are saying slight official cause which is what missouri thinks the in whole or in part means then you can just say slight cause when you are describing the contributory negligence 
 okay but the instruction that your side asked for as i understand it was not a slight cause instruction it was an in whole or in part instruction 
 what we asked for was an equivalence 
 okay and that all right but if you are asking for the in whole or in part instruction on contributory negligence it seems to me the judge has got to have been correct in saying no to that because to the extent that it addresses multiple causation it would be addressing a problem that couldnt even occur in contributory negligence which will always be in part 
 that was not the basis on which the judge rejected it he didnt reject it on the basis 
 well maybe that was not the basis on which he rejected it but if we have got to consider it in deciding whether to reverse it 
 well the point here that remains is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction now if theres some variant of that we could certainly argue about that official 
 but thats not what he said he said equivalence instruction was not on multiple causation it was the equivalence instruction on either proximate cause or not proximate cause it was the causation issue it was the proximate causation issue not the multiple causation issue that concerned you right 
 well that is the specific issue in this case 
 they dont have to have proximate we dont have to have proximate 
 right thats our argument 
 okay but because the instruction addresses both in one view proximate cause and multiple cause it would have been misleading so far as the multiple cause issue was concerned and a request for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory negligence really should have been denied is that correct 
 well i think i think the argument would be that that cuts it too fine candidly i think you can make an argument that what you know what we were entitled to was some variant and that our objection here is not 
 you were entitled your official argument is you were entitled to an equivalent instruction on the issue of the need to prove 
 the slightest cause 
 proximate cause or no need to prove proximate cause 
 right 
 thats your basic argument 
 thats our basic argument 
 okay 
 and we didnt get that 
 and i dont think you could have gotten where you want to go with the instruction that your side requested which was an in whole or in part instruction thats my only point 
 well it may be that the in whole part of this may have been slightly misleading although i think you can make an argument that you can end up with in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter but thats not the that wasnt the complaint at trial it wasnt the basis for the trial judges decision wasnt the basis for the court of appeals decision if the court wants to send it back and say is there another objection to this instruction thats fine but it seems to me this court ought to address this issue in the way it has been presented official 
 what was wrong with the instruction in your view of the case that was given instruction number N negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to cause his injuries 
 because thats proximate causation and thats higher than we were required to prove under a doctrine of equivalence your honor 
 thats the direct language 
 yes 
 yeah 
 i would like to reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you mr phillips ms perry 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the controlling question raised here is whether instruction N accurately states federal law thats exactly what petitioner said in their reply brief to the missouri court of appeals they could not have been any clearer that their challenge was to instruction N in john versus poulin this court said that state courts official have the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in their courts even when federal issues are at stake the requirements in the missouri courts were not complied with here no abstract question was presented the sole question presented and preserved was with respect to instruction N and that can again be seen in their opening brief in the missouri court of appeals which specifically says the trial court erred in giving instruction N based on mai N 
 is the question whether instruction N is flawed viewed in isolation or whether it is flawed when its viewed together with the instruction on employer negligence 
 it is viewed in conjunction with the instruction on employer negligence but a fixed concept of what it was they did not challenge the language of instruction N they accepted that holding that language constant what should we do to instruction N they could have objected to instruction N and N and they could have said here are a pair of instructions both in proximate cause and here are a pair of instructions both in resulting in whole or in part and then they could have preserved this issue but they did not do that they accepted instruction N as a correct statement of the law and said now lets look at official instruction N 
 but do you agree that they set out different causation standards N and N 
 yes they do rogers concluded that N years ago and the courts in the federal and state system have nearly uniformly interpreted rogers as reaching that decision 
 so if the causation standards are in fact the same then instruction N is defective isnt that right 
 yes if you can reach that decision without interpreting instruction N or the propriety of instruction N particularly since instruction N contained the exact language of the statute whatever judicial gloss has been put on that language was not told to the jury justice stevens the question you asked whether there was any argument about the different standards the answer is no there was no argument the only way in which the jury learned of this difference was in the language of the instruction and instruction N 
 let me ask you this question if i may perhaps i should have asked mr phillips is there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence i understand the restatement describes what the plaintiffs official burden is on proving causation and then it says the same rules apply to defendants contributory negligence but that doesnt sound to me like any overriding doctrine of equivalence it just says when they wrote the restatement the rules were the same is there such a thing as the doctrine of equivalence 
 there wasnt in the early N s for certain your honor because at that time even petitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging and if we look at the language of N it talks about the type of contributory negligence that used to be a bar and that certainly was a type of contributory negligence that only arose with the traditional proximate cause it certainly wasnt on the slightest cause standard 
 well doesnt there have to be a doctrine of equivalence when you are running a comparative negligence regime because you know you talk about the plaintiffs negligence causing the harm to a certain degree and the defendants negligence causing it to a certain degree and if you are not dealing with apples and apples it seems to me you cant conduct the comparison 
 no your honor you can conduct the comparison and it happens all the time in cases where one party has committed intentional misconduct and official another party has had negligent misconduct the causation standards are different in that instance theres a 
 right but we are talking about comparative negligence here where theres negligence on both sides and i just dont know how you say one partys N percent contributed N percent to the harm and the other N percent if you are using different causation standards 
 well the causation standard is used to decide what negligence you use in the balance and in the comparison for example if a party is negligent but the negligence had no causative effect that negligence falls out of the analysis 
 yeah but your example of other instances including having to compare a defendant who did the tort intentionally with negligent contributory negligence thats not what we have here we have here a difference in the causation intentional or nonintentional has nothing to do with causation but once you say that theres a difference in the causation it seems to me you cannot compare the two you cannot compare the two sensibly unless you are using the same kind of a standard i mean lets assume that you find that the official railroad did not directly but nonetheless caused the injury to some extent but the defendant was directly contributory to it what do i do do i add another N percent to his culpability because it was his causation was more direct than the plaintiffs causation 
 no 
 why not 
 it just affects which negligence was in the balance and 
 no it doesnt it certainly bears considerably upon the culpability of the two it seems to me 
 well in responding going back to your question about intentional conduct the petitioners reply brief in fact states that a broader range of harms are considered proximately caused by intentional torts so there is a different conception of proximate cause in that context but in any event their merits brief consistently argues for a proximate cause standard in fact it closes with that and its criticism of instruction N in this case was precisely that it was a proximate cause standard so if they are now before this court asking for a proximate cause standard they conceded that instruction N was a proximate cause standard they in official fact complained about it precisely because it was a proximate cause standard that issue really isnt before this court anymore 
 you dont have any conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to instruction N which is the employees instruction because its comparative negligence it seems to me that necessarily implies in whole or in part if you can reduce his recovery because hes in part negligent what would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in instruction N 
 well i think justice souter hit the nail on the head on that one in that it does create confusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad worker is responsible for other parties culpability as well moreover 
 no no i thought justice souters point was that taking it out of the railroads instruction might cause confusion because of it but i dont see how adding it to both of them when you are dealing with comparative negligence and its necessarily the case that partial negligence on either of their parts can enter into the verdict i dont see how that can be confusing 
 well in official 
 you can answer it 
 i dont want to interrupt anybody 
 answer the question justice souter yes or no 
 the point that i was trying to make about it being misleading is that if you use the in whole or in part language for a contributory negligence instruction you are misleading the jury into thinking that at least there might be whole contributory negligence there never will be you dont get the contributory negligence unless you have already found the defendant was negligent at least to some degree therefore if the plaintiff is negligent it can only be in part thats all i was trying to say 
 under that scenario then what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the accident 
 if petitioner had asked for an instruction that said directly contributed in part the inclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any impact it could still potentially mislead the jury but they were seeking not just to add the words resulting in whole or in part but remove the word directly because it connoted proximate cause and that they felt proximate official cause was not the appropriate standard for contributory negligence even though now that is the standard that they solely are seeking 
 well two things you might comment on first the in whole or in part you might take account of the fact that there are other negligent actors third parties who have contributed to the injury to the employee secondly section N does not contain the language in whole or in part 
 absolutely your honor it does not in section 
 but thats what justice souter has identified right thats not because they are adopting different standards 
 i disagree your honor i think it is because they are adopting different standards the contributory negligence 
 well you just told me a good reason for not putting in whole or in part in instruction N is because it doesnt make sense the whole part doesnt make sense with contributory negligence thats a good reason not to put it in section N either 
 thats one reason but another reason official is that its a different standard in section N they are talking about contributory negligence that was a bar to liability that type of contributory negligence was the kind that was more than it wasnt caused by slight causation it required proximate cause that was a pretty harsh result and it certainly didnt arise in instances where the plaintiff had just had the slightest causal connection and that certainly was the conclusion in rogers 
 well no no may i pick you up on that because theres a point at which you and i are disagreeing about rogers and in all candor i think its because you are ignoring one part of rogers and if im wrong i want you to tell me you quote the slightest bit language from rogers on both page N and N of your brief and you take that as being language that eliminates the proximate cause requirement what you dont include in your quotation is the footnote in justice brennans opinion following that slightest cause language and the footnote was to a citation the citation was to the coray case the opinion in coray was written by justice douglas and im sorry justice black and in the very language that justice black used he said expressly that if proximate official cause is shown there can be recovery now given the fact that in rogers the very citation to the language which you say eliminated the proximate cause requirement cited a case in which proximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on i dont see how you can read rogers maybe later cases but i dont see how you can read rogers as eliminating the proximate cause requirement and therefore i think you have to read rogers as addressing the issue of multiple causation not proximate causation now am i going wrong there somewhere 
 i have two responses your honor first justice brennan wrote crane twelve years later 
 absolutely right 
 and he you know definitely clearly said that a railroad worker does not have to prove common law proximate causation relying on rogers 
 he did but he was also pointing out just to make it simpler he was pointing out in crane that the liability arose in crane out of i forget the full name of it the appliance act and the appliance act had its own set of standards and therefore you cannot from an appliance act case you cannot infer anything one way or the other about the general standard in fela and to make it even more official complicated as i recall rogers was an appliance case too but he didnt get into that there but my only point is you are right about the two brennan opinions rogers and the crane but given the fact that it was an appliance case i dont think you can infer one thing or another about an ultimate fela standard in the absence of an appliance action what remains is that the citation in rogers was to coray and coray spoke about there still being proximate cause 
 yes but if we look at those earlier cases particularly coray we can see that rogers articulated what was meant by that proximate cause language proximate cause is in a sense a label for scope of liability or legal cause as the restatement says it doesnt have any singular conception and in coray the court found 
 well it is understood by everybody isnt it that at least it has the conception which is captured by using the word direct as in instruction N and at least it has that core of meaning whenever it is used doesnt it in other words it may not have a lot of bells and whistles associated with it in the prior law but at least it requires some direct causation as opposed to official indirect right 
 yes your honor 
 okay and thats i dont know that justice brennans citation to coray or corays use of the language carries you any further than that but thats as far as mr phillips wants to go 
 we dont accept that but even if thats the case the rogers the parties to rogers immediately interpreted that decision as affecting proximate cause twelve years later this court did say that in crane the lower courts have uniformly nearly uniformly interpreted rogers in a certain way and at this point stare decisis suggests that this court should not overrule 
 that may be that may be but it seems to me that thats a different argument from saying rogers requires it because i dont think you can get that out of rogers 
 well and i also think though that by lightening by saying the slightest cause possible or you know a slight cause would create liability that does affect proximate cause 
 you dont have to say that i mean you know when in doubt we ought to follow the words of the statute and so whole or in part official makes sense with the railroad but directly doesnt appear in section N why dont we just why shouldnt the instruction just say such negligence of the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury its not going to be a complete bar because we know the immediate the next instruction talks about reducing the award by the amount of the negligence why wouldnt that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms 
 because section N refers to contributory negligence that created a bar and that was the type of negligence that required proximate cause moreover the type of instruction you are positing is not at all what petitioner requested in this case 
 well no but he requested that the instructions be the same and the directly is what causes the problem and directly doesnt appear in the statute 
 but under missouri procedures you have to be clear in the nature of your objection and the objection was that we want the same language we want the language resulting in whole or in part and out of respect for the state courts and their right to create the rules that govern in those courts that was not satisfactory under missouri rules missouri rules also have specific requirements for what you have official to do in the court of appeals theres a point relied on which is the argument heading in the brief and its required by rule N and it sets forth a very specific format and its supposed to start with the trial court erred in and then you give your reasons and it says that negligence it erred in instructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if it concluded that his negligence directly contributed to cause his injury rather than cause his injury in whole or in part you know there is no issue that was preserved in the missouri courts other than that challenge cook versus caldwell which we cite in our brief in missouri not only do you have to object but you have to keep consistent with the basis of the objection you cant just object to instruction N on one ground go up to the court of appeals and raise a completely different challenge to instruction N you have to stay consistent and out of respect 
 do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence 
 that was a justification for rewriting instruction N to include the words resulting in whole or in part i do not think they raised an abstract argument about equivalency that in order to do that official they would have had to object to instruction N and instruction N because equivalency in the abstract would require modification of both instructions and they clearly chose to accept the language of instruction N and only object to instruction N so no not in the abstract it hasnt been raised it was a justification for one particular result and that was a result that would have modified instruction N and in a particular way too modified it in a way of including the words resulting in whole or in part 
 i guess they want to make the argument now whether they did or not that if we look at section N which i think is the part dealing with contributory negligence i dont see anything else it doesnt speak of causation at all 
 exactly your honor 
 it just says if theres some contributory negligence the damages will be diminished according to the negligence attributable to the employee so i take it their argument was maybe with hindsight judge dont give this direct language because nothing requires it and since other things being equal nothing requires it you ought to give the same language you gave for the other side and they said the judge rejected that argument so official now they tell us well that was wrong he should have accepted it and all the rest of what hes saying is just in case the court wants to reach it or something like that but what about that one 
 im sorry your honor could you 
 well i mean should we answer the question he now perhaps in his minimalist position might want to raise or maybe did that section N doesnt speak of causation the judge gave a causation instruction the judges causation instruction in their view was wrong and the law requires the judges causation instruction on contributory negligence if there is one to be the same as it was on direct the defendants negligence and he says that isnt what happened we objected to it we produced arguments one of them was this equivalence thing so hes saying to us decide it say that they were wrong whats your view of that 
 we disagree with petitioner 
 im not surprised 
 the abstract question of equivalency 
 no no thats just an argument 
 right official 
 it was not but they say nonetheless we did object that this instruction was wrong one reason it was wrong is because it speaks of causation differently than when they spoke of causation in respect to the railroad we thought that was a reason why it was wrong then we think thats a reason why it is wrong now and we would like the missouri court but they wouldnt do it so we want you to say it was wrong for that reason 
 well i think we are in a difficult position right now because they are asking for proximate cause in their blue brief 
 oh we say well we will abandon all that thats just a series of different arguments that wed like the court to say 
 okay if we are putting aside the blue brief then 
 if you read it carefully you will see it basically 
 but if the question goes to the fact that section N doesnt have an express causation standard in it what you fall back on is traditional proximate cause that congress departed from the traditional proximate cause standard by using the words official resulting in whole or in part in section N it didnt create the same departure in section N in fact by referring to the kind of contributory negligence that creates a bar it was pretty much pointing right back to proximate cause 
 can you have more than one proximate cause 
 i believe the treatises that say yes 
 of course so then how can in whole or in part possibly eliminate the proximate cause requirement because it could be in part and still be a proximate cause how can that language possibly be interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement 
 because when a cause that when a slightest cause can give rise to liability that has effectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard there is still a legal cause requirement yes 
 but it could be the slightest direct cause which is justice scalias point 
 well but if we look at like the first 
 now it may mislead the jury if thats all you say but as a matter of analyzing the statute or even of analyzing what the court meant in rogers you can have a slight but direct cause and that official would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis isnt that so 
 well no the restatement for example at the time of rogers talked about substantial factors and talked in other words 
 how can you say no when you acknowledge that the prior law when there was contributory negligence used to require proximate cause for both the negligence of the defendant and for the contributory negligence of the defendant such a situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesnt have to be the sole cause it can be just the cause in part right 
 right 
 so the mere fact that we had contributory negligence statutes that were applying proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a proximate cause can be a cause in part 
 yes your honor but what rogers and the statute recognizes that it can be a very very slight cause and what it was understood for example in the 
 thats what rogers might have said but the statute doesnt say anything about slight cause it only says in whole or in part official 
 and neither did the instruction it just used the words resulting in whole or in part also but rogers did interpret the language resulting in whole or in part as meaning playing any part even the slightest and that has been the law for N years and it would be a massive change in the law as justice scalia said earlier for this court to depart from that at this point in time 
 it doesnt seem to me that slight is the opposite of proximate it could be a slight proximate cause 
 the restatement at the time of rogers talked about substantial factors and in the comment to that it explains that sometimes the other causes can be so predominant that one causation is just not sufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to constitute a legal cause so there is a component of quantity within the concepts of proximate cause i believe their reply brief talks about substantial factor and to talk about something as being a substantial factor does have a quantum component to it just as slight has a quantum component to it a slight cause could not be a substantial factor or oftentimes would not be a substantial factor so the two really do go hand in official glove 
 but under the old rule that plaintiffs negligence in whatever degree was an absolute bar to recovery wasnt the rule customarily stated that plaintiffs negligence however slight was a total bar to recovery 
 im not aware of that your honor it may be 
 i thought it was i may be wrong about that 
 i am not aware of that so that would be a pretty harsh remedy if that were the case 
 thats what i thought yes i thought it was a pretty harsh rule 
 and clearly congress in this statute was trying to move away from the common law in many respects to protect the railroad worker and the interpretation of section N as lightening the causation standard for the defendants negligence but leaving intact the traditional proximate cause standard for plaintiffs contributory negligence completely comports with the purpose of congress in enacting the statute 
 why isnt in whole or in part simply the logical corollary of introducing comparative negligence why do you have to read that as official departing from proximate cause instead of simply recognizing that under N negligence on the part of the employee can reduce recovery which without barring it 
 i reach that conclusion on the basis of rogers and in the petitioners brief 
 beyond that if the plaintiffs negligence was in whole the cause of the action then the there was no reason to get to comparative negligence or contributory negligence because by hypothesis there would have been no negligence by the defendant 
 yes your honor 
 thats why you dont have in whole or in part in N not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there but because as justice stevens pointed out you wouldnt have it in whole or in part 
 even the petitioners brief describes the language resulting in whole or in part as an elaboration of proximate cause they recognize that it has bearing on proximate cause and so if it has bearing on proximate cause in section N it certainly would have bearing on proximate cause if it was incorporated into the language of the instruction on contributory negligence so that may be one reason for not including the official language but another reason is that it does affect the causation standard and congress did not incorporate it in section N whereas it did have it in section N and when it modified the statute in N for assumption of the risk to abolish assumption of the risk it did not equate proximate cause and resulting in whole or in part necessarily as the same thing because one version had proximate cause and it was not adopted the phrase resulting in whole or in part was used in its place so suggesting that congress may in fact have seen a difference just as rogers concluded and i think rightly so moreover as i said that has been the law for N years and its pretty settled in this country and it would create a massive change if this court were to depart from that moreover this is not the right case to decide that because the language in instruction N said resulting in whole or in part and petitioner has never 
 it is not the kind of change anybody would have relied on is it i mean i find it hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation 
 excuse me your honor 
 i find it hard to see any reliance interest on this N year old interpretation official is there anybody doing something differently because they believe that the railroad does not have to be accused of proximate causality does anybody act differently because of that rule i dont think so 
 well for mr sorrell in particular i mean he acted that he allowed that instruction to be used and now they are attempting to disrupt this judgment 
 i suppose employees have been under the rule for a long time 
 yes 
 i suppose employee associations workman compensation schemes and congress have all relied on it 
 yes you are absolutely right your honor and there is employees compensation for railroad workers and that may be very well be because of this interpretation of rogers that was adopted N years ago 
 thank you ms perry 
 thank you 
 mr phillips you have two minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice id official like to address just sort of two issues one is the minimalist issue that justice breyer asked about it seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case is we raised the question of whether or not the missouri standard which says that you cannot deviate from our designated instructions creates a disparity in the way you approach negligence and contributory negligence that disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines and nothing in fela modifies it and its wrong and that by itself warrants the case being set aside and a new jury being and a new trial thats the simplest way to resolve the issue if the court wishes to go forward and deal with the issue that justice souter addressed then the question is what does rogers mean and what do you do with this in whole or in part language and if you go back you asked the question justice souter you know what does the common law say we cite this on page N if its negligence contributes proximately to the injury no matter how slightly there must be a dozen cases that we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter how slightly and they refer to in whole or in part as language that still recognizes that you still require proximate causation the reality is nothing in rogers remotely casts official doubt on cases like brady that say butfor causation is not enough you have to have proximate causation or earnest where this court said that proximate causation is the correct jury instruction that has to be given this court said nothing about that in rogers 
 would you have in your ideal instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury that defendants negligence must be the proximate cause of plaintiffs injury 
 no justice ginsburg we didnt ask for that all im saying to you 
 would you 
 is that the guidance of the court on remand you could and we would ask you to address that issue and to resolve it it is fairly in front of you 
 but in your model instruction in your correct instruction would the jury be told in order to hold the defendant liable you must find the defendants negligence is the proximate cause of plaintiffs injury 
 yes that would be my preferred instruction on remand yes 
 even though almost universally the term proximate cause has been criticized as totally official incomprehensible to juries 
 let me ask this one very brief question mr chief justice in your view would the doctrine of equivalence be satisfied if we simply directed that the word directly be omitted from the instruction N 
 i think that would certainly go a long way i dont know exactly how strictly you want to do it but sure i mean thats the pivotal problem with the way that instruction reads today justice stevens 
 thank you mr phillips the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in carey versus musladin mr ott 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this court has never addressed the constitutionality of photo buttons worn by spectators during a criminal trial the two closest decisions of this court estelle v williams and holbrook v flynn established only a general rule that some courtroom practices may be so inherently prejudicial that they violate the defendants right to a fair trial neither flynn nor williams 
 well it went a little bit beyond that i mean the justice marshall announced not merely the possibility of inherent prejudice but he spoke in terms of practices that raised a risk that improper factors would come into play in the jury decision isnt that the criterion 
 an unacceptable risk your honor 
 thats the criterion 
 well the test has been formulated different ways 
 thats the way he formulated it thats the way the court in flynn formulated it 
 in flynn it did but it also just a paragraph or so earlier said that the only question we need to answer is whether this practice and there the courtroom uniformed guards is so inherently prejudicial that it violates the defendants right to a fair trial we dont believe that those are material 
 that was the end point that they were reaching and then he elaborated on that by referring to the unacceptable risk that improper considerations would come into play and it seems to me that if you are going to talk about the criterion of the test or the standard however you want to describe it in flynn you have got to get that latter point about unacceptable risk of improper factors 
 that certainly was a formulation of the test its been we can accept it as the formulation of the test and it was accepted by the california courts below they attempted to apply that test they announced the proper the correct clearly established law of this court and then proceeded to analyze the issue below however on federal habeas review the circuit court of appeals used its own circuit case to define clearly established law under aedpa instead of assessing the state courts application of the general rule the circuit court narrowed this courts general rule into one that specifically condemned buttons instead of granting the state court wide leeway to apply this courts general rule it the circuit court created a narrow rule that would seemingly prohibit buttons in any case 
 well i suppose if the court of appeals had case a and it said we interpret the supreme court rule to be as follows it could then later say in case b this is how we have interpreted the supreme court rule and we are bound by case a this is the elaboration we have given to it and we have to find that the state court of course isnt bound by what we do but we are bound by what we do when we review what the state court has decided 
 well your honor makes a distinction between a postaedpa case and preaedpa cases in a postaedpa setting it is the circuit court of appeals is looking at its own postaedpa case post aedpa aedpa case which has said that this set of facts constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established law we dont disagree that stare decisis might come into play there it doesnt mean that that first decision was correct but we dont what happened here in contrast was a preaedpa decision that was used to define the clearly established law of this court give it more detail such that the circumstances here fell outside of it 
 to apply an opinion of this court to particular circumstances and find that in the view of the court of appeals it produces a certain result is not necessarily to say that that is clearly established supreme court law it just means that it is their best guess as to how it comes out right 
 thats correct 
 i mean they are forced to decide it one way or the other the supreme court opinion either means this or that they are not applying a clearly established test to the supreme court are they 
 not by doing that however the circuit court of appeals here expressly stated it was looking to its own circuit authority to define the law that is clearly established it specifically stated that this case that the states decision was unreasonable in light of norris it specifically stated that the state courts decision could not reasonably be distinguished from norris 
 we are looking under aedpa at an unreasonable application of supreme court law what do you do in a situation where you think the state court has incorrectly articulated supreme court law but nonetheless reached the correct result in other words correct understanding of the established supreme court law would have led to the same result as their incorrect articulation of it 
 mr chief justice at first the the first thing to do would be to look at the fair import as this court stated in wilford v biscotti look at the fair import of the decision now i dont know if you are referring to the issue about the arguable misarticulation of the text at the end of the state courts decision here but the first question is to look at the fair import and if the fair import is that the correct test was applied then habeas relief does not lie 
 right my hypothetical and we will debate later whether it is this case or not is lets say that the state court wrongly articulates supreme court law but under the correct articulation it leads to the same result what happens in that case under aedpa 
 i believe that the habeas relief should not lie now i have seen circuit courts treat it different ways some courts will decline to give deference and review it de novo but i dont think congress intended in enacting aedpa the aedpa that a state habeas a state conviction should be overturned simply because of an accident in a statement or formulation of the test but the conviction is otherwise constitutionally balanced 
 you are actually saying the answer to the chief justices question is that you would then review it de novo but on de novo review you would sustain the conviction if it came to the right result 
 yes i believe so if i understood you correctly the question correctly yes 
 you would not affirm you would not sustain the conviction relying on aedpa you would say aedpa authorizes review but on review we conclude the conviction was correct thats what i understand the aedpa to be 
 yes with the caveat that we are assuming that the hypothetical is that the state court has misapplied that the fair import has they have misapplied the holdings of this court 
 correct 
 it misarticulated them i guess the question of application is i mean i assumed they reached what we would regard as the correct result under the correct standard they just articulated the wrong standard your answer i take it is that it would then be reviewed without aedpa deference 
 no your honor then i misunderstood the question the deference would still apply if you could look at the decision as a whole and see that the correct standard was applied if they have erroneously stated the standard if the state court erroneously stated the standard but you can look to the decision as a whole and see that the correct standard was nevertheless applied deference is still due 
 we are concerned here with the court of the role if any that a circuit court that opinions of courts other than this court have in determining whether law is clearly established do you exclude entirely from the province of what is proper for the federal court to consider any court of appeals federal court of appeals decisions 
 yes we do your honor 
 so that the only thing your argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are decisions of this court and that if you dont have a case on all fours as we have no buttons case then thats the end of it 
 no your honor we our position is that a federal habeas court may not look at all to state or circuit authority on the question of what is clearly established only the holdings of this court and what appears on their face if theres a general rule such as here the question moves to the reasonable application prong and under that prong because the rule is general as this court stated in yarborough versus alvarado the more general the rule the more leeway there is relief can still lie under certain circumstances but its it moves into a question of objective reasonableness of the state courts decision 
 suppose all of the suppose there are five circuits they are the only ones that looked at the issue and they all say we think the general rule of the supreme court is as follows isnt that entitled to some weight you are not supposed to cite that when you go to the sixth circuit court or you go to the state court 
 if your honor is speaking only to the clearly established prong my answer would be no if a circuit court says jackson v virginia is clearly established law on the sufficiency of the evidence we have no dispute with that but to redefine or shape this courts holdings beyond the face of those holdings our position is that cannot be done with state or circuit law circuit law and state law may be relevant to the question of reasonable application but not on the first prong if a federal habeas court looks to circuit or state authority on the first prong of N the reasonableness becomes a foregone conclusion the two the two sections of the statute collapse into what is essentially de novo review as what happened here once for instance the habeas court here decided that its own circuit authority required or prohibited buttons reasonableness was a foregone conclusion even though it was addressed by the circuit but in further response to your question your honor our position is that on the reasonable application prong a federal habeas court may look to state and circuit cases they are of varying relevance but they should look to state and federal circuit cases equally but not all those cases have the same relevance we have there is a distinction between preaedpa and postaedpa cases and the distinction between whether those cases support or contradict the state courts opinion 
 so would there be any difference if this had been a postaedpa if the circuit precedent had been postaedpa 
 there would be a difference your honor the depending on the prong we are looking at under our argument would still be the same under on the clearly established prong of N that even if norris was a postaedpa case that the circuit court could not look to norris to define this courts holdings but norris if it were a postaedpa case would have more relevance on the reasonable application prong there stare decisis might come into play it doesnt mean norris is correct it doesnt mean that the result reached by the circuit court of appeals in this case would be correct but it would certainly be more relevant 
 can you tell us lets assume for a minute that this case were on direct review that we dont have aedpa what is the standard that should control whether there is an impermissible an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors will be taken into account by the jury is that the test 
 that is a test the test one of the formulations of it i dont believe it materially differs from our position is it doesnt materially differ from the general due process fair trial standard that applies in all cases 
 well but you should make it more specific for us you say general due process how does that work in this case i want to know whether or not i can order or must order someone to remove a sign a button a piece of clothing whats the test that i use 
 your honor it is an assessment of all the circumstances that if you are a trial judge 
 that unless you want to go on that doesnt help me we just tell all the judges in the country to assess all the circumstances we say no more 
 no your honor lets take the impermissible factor test the state court judge should look at the circumstances before him and determine whether he believes that there is an unacceptable risk of impermissible factors coming into play whether the practice at issue whether it be buttons or ribbons or what have you is so likely to prejudice this defendant or violate or infringe on his fundamental rights that we need to order them removed not just as a matter of supervisory power but as a constitutional requirement so it is a spectrum test your honor and its essentially a totality test of the circumstances of the buttons lets say and there cant be a bright line rule the circumstances 
 why couldnt there be here i mean at some point at some point seeing every judge in this case say this is a thoroughly no let me not exaggerate but they say wearing buttons is a bad idea for obvious reasons now at some point if enough judges say that each time they say well it is a bad idea but we cant say in this case that it was so prejudicial theres that inherent risk that its unconstitutional but if some point if people begin enough is enough to say this is quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a courtroom which is not a place for demonstration does it not become pretty clear irrespective of exactly what opinions say what that this is just very unfair and unconstitutional 
 your honor my answer is no as a supervisory matter a state court can do whatever it wishes under the state constitution state statutes state rules of court can do many things under its supervisory power or even state constitutional power that is different altogether however from saying that all buttons violate the constitution which is different in turn from saying all buttons require habeas relief 
 what about banners what would you do with banners 
 i beg your pardon 
 what would you do with banners would it make sense to say all banners are banned from the courtroom i thought you would think that would make a lot of sense 
 banners 
 yes signs placards 
 your honor i havent seen a case involving banners i imagine that 
 i think i know why because it affects the atmospherics of the trial 
 and likewise we dont see all the button cases where the buttons have been precluded 
 well you also dont allow people to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts and we dont allow people to you know to wear beany hats everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the trial isnt that right 
 thats correct your honor 
 maybe thats why we dont allow banners because a courtroom is not the place for banners 
 thats correct your honor decorum should not be confused with 
 absolutely right suppose you think in this federal court which we are that banners posters and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea now why not just because of decorum but because they introduce an extraneous factor into the judgment of the jury and suppose i also think im not saying i do im trying this out but it is pretty hard to draw lines among buttons it is pretty hard to draw lines among banners and the only way to guarantee fair trials in whole is to have a wholesale rule on this no buttons no banners no petitions no posters how would you explain you just say the law just doesnt permit that 
 well your honor 
 what do you want to say about that because that is a concern i have 
 i understand your honor and this court obviously has the power to enact a prophylactic rule that but a prophylactic rule covers many unconstitutional as well as constitutional practices and that a prophylactic rule requires the prophylactic rule that might be enacted would require preclusion of buttons does not mean that all the buttons that might come up are necessarily prejudicial 
 im not so sure you think that we could just say we are going to exercise our best judgment not necessarily amend the constitution just because it is a good idea banners and buttons are hereby banned forever do we have the authority to just say that 
 well your honor in this case this case has this court granted certiorari on the question of application of the aedpa so we are not asking certainly not asking for that 
 we are exploring initially what the rule ought to be 
 may i ask this question supposing we all thought that this practice in this particular case deprived the defendant of a fair trial but we also agreed with you that aedpa prevents us from announcing such a judgment what if we wrote an opinion saying it is perfectly clear there was a constitutional violation here but congress has taken away our power to reverse it then a year from now the same case arises could we follow could the district court follow our dicta or could it would it be constrained to say we dont know what the supreme court might do 
 it could not follow this courts dicta under this courts statement in williams v taylor that only the holdings not the dicta of this court establish clearly clearly establish supreme court authority i believe that the rule if theres going to be one should be the rule that was applied here a general rule of fundamental fairness considering the totality of the circumstances before the trial court i think the rule works and it worked in this case 
 you dont need to establish that rule do you you just need to establish that what the supreme court determined was not an unreasonable application of this courts law 
 thats correct mr chief justice we are not asking for a new rule applicable to buttons the reason we are here is because of the circuit courts method in addressing this case and granting habeas relief 
 what if the button had said the three buttons had said hang musladin would you say that there was not there was not sufficiently clear law from this court to find that practice unconstitutional under justice marshalls formulation 
 your honor it wouldnt change the clearly established prong we still have the general rule but i think that your instance is one that all judges would agree is so egregious that it falls within the ambit of that and would require habeas relief 
 falls within the ambit of what of a mobdominated atmosphere or your answer to justice souter was aedpa would was that this would require reversal even under aedpa is that your answer 
 i can concede that yes your honor that 
 we both want to know why you say that 
 well the question is objective reasonableness and we dont dispute that some circumstances may present such a situation that no one no judge is going to disagree that the situation at the state court if it denied the relief on the three buttons you posed was unreasonable 
 okay but what are the getting into the formulation what are the impermissible factors as to which a risk is raised by wearing the hang musladin button what are those factors 
 the hang musladin button the impermissible factor first is the explicit message hang musladin convict him its urging the jury to convict him and that 
 well whats wrong with that the prosecutor is going to get up and urge the jury to convict him what is wrong with it on the button what risk does the button raise that the prosecutors argument does not thats what we are getting at 
 it is an outside influence your honor it is an influence coming from 
 how different is it from the victims family sitting in the second row behind the prosecution every day of the trial and i mean im the hypothetical correctly focuses on the question at least for me of whether or not you can have specific applications of general rules that are clearly established im just not sure your agreement with it is advisable because it seems to me that simply having how many people have to wear these buttons one person shows up with a hang musladin button does that mean it is a mobdominated trial 
 no your honor my what i the point i meant to make was that we are not urging that relief can never lie because theres a general rule of application 
 all right 
 its a spectrum and i would im not conceding that the example necessarily requires habeas relief because there are a whole host of circumstances that we wouldnt know about it for instance whether it was ever seen in cases that people dont see the button or what have you 
 what about simply the facts that we have in this case which i thought i was doing maybe i wasnt clear about it but the button is different instead of putting a picture of the victim its got the statement hang musladin its worn every day by three members of his family who sit behind the prosecution table within the sight of the jury assume those facts would habeas relief be required under the general rule 
 i dont think it would be required i think it would be reasonable to say that habeas relief must lie there are many there are much fewer inferences that could be drawn there 
 is that a way of saying that its required should look should a court grant habeas relief on my facts 
 not necessarily your honor it there are 
 why 
 well as mr chief justice pointed out three family members of the victim sitting in the front row buttons or not the buttons dont add add little if anything to the three victims family members sitting there grieving through a trial they add very little for instance in this case 
 i dont know whether they are grieving or not but i certainly know the sentiment that they are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a button that says hang musladin 
 your honor i submit that the sentiment is obvious to the jury 
 pardon 
 i would submit that that sentiment is obvious to the jury that a juror 
 they may not want him hung they may not believe in the death penalty 
 i wish you hadnt said that because i had thought that one of the things that made this case leaning in your direction is the fact that merely having a picture of their loved one on the button doesnt convey the message you know hang the defendant or even convict the defendant it just conveys at most to the jury you know this is we have been deprived of someone we love you should take this matter very seriously and consider the case carefully it is an important matter to us and therefore you ought to deliberate carefully i dont know that it means anything more than that 
 your honor i did not intend at all to suggest that that was a message from those buttons what i meant to say was the buttons add very little because i think a juror understands what a 
 you said you know convict whats or hang whats his name thats quite you are equating that with the buttons in this case and i dont think the buttons in this case say hang so and so or even convict so and so they just say we have been deprived of a loved one this is a terrible matter please jury consider this case carefully thats all it necessarily says 
 thats if any message what the buttons conveyed in this case i was only speaking to the difference between the buttons that justice souter posed as putting forth a more explicit message 
 okay assuming that explicit message could habeas relief be granted in my hypothetical case 
 not necessarily your honor 
 why 
 because in your case i dont think that that message necessarily i think it is reasonable for a state court to conclude that those buttons did not add much to if anything to the presence of 
 is it reasonable for a state court to say that three family members sitting in a courtroom within sight of the jury for whatever number of days the trial ran saying at the guilt stage hang so and so is exposing the jury to a proper influence that it should and may consider in deciding guilt or innocence 
 your honor we could concede that for this case 
 okay why dont you concede that of course that would be exposing the jury to an improper influence in the hang musladin case 
 i thought some states require that the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their case to the jury for harsh penalty i dont know that thats necessarily inappropriate to know that the 
 thats at sentencing after conviction 
 yes yes 
 my hypo is at the guilt stage not the sentencing stage 
 at the guilt stage thats right california statutes do require that victims families be able to make a statement at sentencing they also require that the victims family if the victim is not alive be present at the guilt phase of the trial during the guilt phase of the trial 
 but at the guilt stage is there any is there any question in your mind that allowing the family members to display this message to a jury throughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a risk an unacceptable risk that the jury will consider improper influences in reaching its verdict is there any question 
 your honor your your buttons might raise an impermissible risk 
 thats my hypothetical my buttons hang musladin is there any question about the risk of improper influence on my hypothetical not this case my hypothetical 
 they do but it might still be reasonable for a state court to conclude otherwise and it was certainly reasonable for the state court here to conclude that three simple buttons bearing only a photo did not convey any message of blame guilt anything other than grief of this family if i may reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal 
 thank you mr ott 
 thank you 
 mr fermino 
 mr chief justice may it please the court i want to direct this courts attention to the state court opinion which appears at N a to N a of the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari in this case i want your honors to take a look at that opinion it is N pages in length but the portion of the opinion dealing with the buttons issue is two pages in length of those two pages all but a few sentences deal directly with the norris case i believe it is at roughly page N a in their N a of the appendix all but three sentences deal with the norris case the attorney general has said in its briefing that the court below teased out the particular reference to the buttons that it carefully parsed the opinion that it gave a tendentious analysis this is the description of the attorney general nothing could be further from accuracy these two pages discuss norris head on it is the elephant in the room if you will the court below could not have it would have been impossible for the court below to write this opinion without addressing the norris case head on 
 i thought the key sentence in this is he says the simple photograph of tom studer on a button which i dont know what the size is nobody has told them what the button is about nobody has put for the judge a picture of it nobody showed him what the button is so he says a simple photograph of tom studer was unlikely to have been taken as anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family member period now what else is there to say thats the courts conclusion and it is pretty hard for me i looked for the button i couldnt even find the button in the record i didnt even know what this looks like it is a button somebody later must have said two inches to four inches i dont know who said that i dont know how the judge could have known that the button isnt in the record so why isnt it just a normal sign of grief unlikely to influence anybody thats what they say 
 justice breyer i think that the 
 in this case 
 thats correct and i think that the court it is correct that the record before the state court of appeals was inadequate to address to answer the question but i think what where the court erred is in adding and grafting on an additional element it goes beyond that sentence that justice breyer you focused on i think it is that the it is the element of branding its that this wearing of the buttons in a sense branded the defendant in the eyes of the jurors 
 it goes on frequently in an opinion i have been known to do that myself and i say this court over here says its a dadada and i say sure isnt that well what is it 
 and that language came from one of our opinions didnt it the branding language 
 that was quoting holbrook and flynn 
 thats correct justice ginsburg thats right 
 so you cant fault the court for just saying it isnt that mr ott says it isnt that 
 thats correct but i believe that it is not part of the test it was that the branding language as in justice brennans in justice brennans dissent was not part of the text articulated by 
 repeated later in opinions for the majority i think 
 thats correct 
 in later cases so i mean 
 thats correct 
 dont just put it in brennans dissent 
 i dont understand your point about the state court focusing on norris the question under aedpa is still whether or not it is an unreasonable application of supreme court law 
 well in this instance much has been said about the opinion and the carefully written opinion of the state court but the portion of the opinion that focuses on this issue is as i said roughly two pages in length and deals almost entirely with norris norris was the contrast case for the court of appeals 
 but in here it you agree that the california court has as much authority to say what federal law is as the ninth circuit right they are on a par ninth circuit decisions in no way binds the supreme court of california isnt that so 
 that is correct 
 so that this state court of appeals chose to be respectful to the ninth circuit to consider what it had said doesnt sound to me like a very strong argument 
 well justice ginsburg i would respectfully disagree i think that the were this discussion of norris to be a much longer discussion or excuse me part of a much longer discussion that might be true but its entire focus was norris it used norris by way of negative explication to show that the facts before it didnt fall within the rule as derived from williams and flynn and i think that goes beyond respect to the ninth circuit i think it took the case it grappled with it it decided that it was different than norris and i think that there would have been no way for the court below to have looked at the facts of this case without addressing norris 
 well what was the what in your opinion this is why as you can see im concerned about buttons i think they are probably a problem i think all judges are concerned about them but then i think about this particular case and i look at that single sentence it was unlikely to be taken as a sign of anything other than normal grief i mean suppose this had been a different case suppose the defense in this case was the defendant smith didnt pull the trigger it was an unknown person called jones then if i were on the jury i would look out see the buttons and id say hmmm the family thinks it was smith otherwise they wouldnt be here with those buttons i could think that but this isnt that case this is a case where everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger the only question is whether the familys son came at him with a machete so when i look at the buttons id think sure they dont think the son came at him with i mean they dont think that hes their son what would you expect them to think so thats why i thought that they are saying that sentence in this case in this case it would be taken as sign of grief and nothing more 
 well justice breyer that is certainly a plausible reading of the state court opinion however i think you have also identified one the problem with this it is the risk not the reality and thats why we have to look beyond the facts of this case and look to the rule as derived from the williams and flynn case as i think the court below properly did and in doing so in applying it to this case i think you have to do away with this kind of courtroom behavior it is simply not acceptable it is not acceptable to wear 
 to wear any buttons it says fair trial 
 any courtroom practice that causes an impermissible risk that the jurys that the jury would come to a conclusion based on a factor not introduced at trial is entirely prejudicial 
 i mean most i dont think a typical jury will understand that the victim is going to have a family and they are going to be sorry that hes dead and they might be there at his trial and they may not like the person accused of murdering their son that is not that is sort of like in every case thats not the buttons dont seem to add much to what the jury will derive from seeing the family seated behind the prosecution bench 
 i agree with mr chief justice up unto the point of its not different wearing the buttons i think that you add the buttons and you are creating you are doing essentially what the rule derived from both williams and flynn teaches us is wrong 
 but in williams and flynn and all of the cases that we have had whatever way they went it was always the government requiring a defendant to do something wear prison clothes appear in court with shackles and in the case that went for the government the extra officers in the courtroom we havent had a case have we where it is spectator conduct as opposed to government conduct thats being attacked 
 that is correct justice ginsburg there isnt a case that is that where the state action element if you will is not present however i would posit that in this case where you have a judge a trial judge who denies a lawyers motion that you have implicit in that state action that the court has endorsed the practice of 
 that certainly goes beyond where our precedent leaves off that is we are dealing with direct impositions by government in a way that poses an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant 
 thats correct 
 yes and you are having the judge say that you cant wear certain signs you cant make certain demonstrations if the family were there and they and one of the members of the family was sobbing with tears coming out of her eyes i that 
 justice 
 much it has much more impact than a button 
 it and it might but that kind of behavior by a courtroom spectator can be controlled by a trial judge if when it occurs if it is spontaneous it can be controlled a rule that spectators arent allowed to emote would be implausible or would be impractical we are not talking here today about controlling the emotions of spectators we are talking about an impermissible factor like a message or the risk of a message 
 yeah but there is a first amendment problem when you are dealing with activities of people other than the prosecution people other than the state who is bringing this prosecution 
 there is no question that there is a first amendment issue here 
 so that makes it a different case it makes it very hard to say well the supreme courts already decided this matter 
 well in the first amendment context though theres a balancing test that needs to be employed and it 
 sure it may come out the way it may come out the way you want but its hard to say that the supreme court any supreme court case bears upon it when we havent had a case that involves weighing the first amendment right of the people in the courtroom to wear buttons or cry or 
 i believe that mr cohen in new hampshire wearing his sign regarding the draft 
 well but that cuts against you 
 i understand that but 
 this reason suppose hypothetically i would think well the rule should be no buttons no buttons no signs no banners a courtroom is a place of fair trial not a place for a demonstration of any kind now if i were to think that and i also were to think its just too difficult to figure out case by case whether there is or is not an improper influence suppose i thought both of those things now you have heard quite rightly the other side says one you are supposed to decide whether this was clear in the law two if you are worried about the future you cant lay down a rule thats clear in the law either because of a aedpa and b the case that was cited which said its holdings that count not dicta all right you write for me the words im supposed to put on paper to achieve your position 
 justice breyer i think that the rule derived from the williams and flynn cases is that courtroom courtroom behavior that creates an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors have or have caused a jurys verdict to be based not solely on evidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial and unless it advances some important state interest some compelling state interest like the concern that i believe justice ginsburg raised about the forcing a defendant to appear in prison garb or the shackling cases that rule i think allows the opinion in this case of the court below to not violate the prescriptions of the aedpa i think thats clear i think what the court below did was essentially apply the rule that i just discussed and i think 
 so what about what if the issue was mourning the trial is being held and the families appear and they are all in black because they are still in mourning does that violate this clearly established rule 
 i think you are getting mr chief justice i think the hypothetical gets closer to it as well i think a defendants excuse me a victims family wearing appearing in court every day wearing black gets closer to the kind of message import again the risk not the reality that this case is that the court below was concerned with 
 no my question is under aedpa if the state court said you know im not going to keep the family out even in mourning that would violate the clearly established rule that you have just articulated 
 yes 
 even if it didnt though i suppose you could draw a line between people who were doing what they naturally do and some people do wear mourning and some people will come into a courtroom and be reminded of the person who died and sob but in this case they are going out of their way to do something that people in mourning do not normally do 
 thats correct 
 and so you have got i think you have got a stronger argument the problem that i have in this case is that number one i view the wearing of the buttons as i just described it as something that is abnormal and something that is intended to presumably get the jurys attention i dont know why otherwise they would be doing it and from whatever source we do know that the button was at least two inches wide and maybe larger so its reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and understood perfectly that these were people who were raising in effect an issue of sympathy i can understand that and under the general rule out of williams and flynn it seems to me theres a pretty darn good argument for saying yes an unacceptable risk has been raised of emotionalism in the jurys deliberations as opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom evidence what however do i make of the fact that not one single court has ever reached that conclusion and you know as a constitutional matter am i in the position of sort of being jim and they are all out of step with jim im raising a question about my own judgment in relation to the fact that no other court seems to have come to that conclusion what do you think i should make of that 
 i think it is a factor to consider in the courts analysis however i think the facts of this case are unique precisely because this typically doesnt we dont get this far because most trial judges dont allow this kind of conduct 
 but there have been havent there been court decisions that have held that buttons didnt compromise a fair trial right 
 thats correct 
 so in assessing the reasonableness of the california supreme courts decision how could we say federal law was clearly established when other courts considering our precedent have gone the other way 
 because i think that under i think that this court looking at the contrary to prong of the analysis would can come to a conclusion that the state courts decision wasnt im getting ahead of myself i think the court can properly in looking at it from a contrary to analysis come to the conclusion that even with that body of case law that the state court got it wrong that it misapplied the clearly established law of this court 
 you dont want to put your hang your hat on the contrary to prong though do you your argument i thought was an unreasonable application argument 
 i think its both mr chief justice i think its both i think i dont need to hang my hat on the contrary to because i think under either prong 
 well but as justice ginsburg pointed out we have never even had a case involving spectators so its not contrary to clearly established law we have cases stating the general principle on which it relies so maybe its an unreasonable application but contrary to seems an awful stretch 
 i wouldnt go mr chief justice i would not go as far as an awful stretch but i would think that we under the unreasonable application prong we certainly win i think that there is also an argument under the contrary to 
 the record is confusing at least as i read it please correct me if im wrong on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn a is it clear from the record how many days the buttons were worn 
 it is not it is not clear at all from the record how many days 
 so it may have been for just one day of the trial 
 it may have been but according to the declarations that were submitted in the petition for collateral review those are petitions those are declarations of the trial counsel and of respondents mother it is that they were worn on multiple days by several members of the family and that the buttons were anywhere from two to four inches in diameter and thats in the record 
 where does it say that 
 those declarations appear 
 these are in the joint appendix 
 these were declarations filed with the united states district court in habeas 
 they were filed actually as part of the state collateral review proceedings they were filed with the habeas and it appears that they are at the ja N and N 
 where does it say in there that the buttons were worn every day 
 if i did im sorry that question 
 it says that the family members were there every day or for many days it doesnt say they wore the buttons every day unless im missing 
 no justice alito if i said that i misspoke i was trying to say that the record is not clear as to the frequency 
 there was a time when the trial judge said stop was there not he initially denied the motion 
 correct 
 but i thought that there was a time in the course of the trial when he told the family members to stop wearing the buttons 
 i dont believe so justice ginsburg i think that they were never admonished not to wear them but that the original ruling of the trial judge stood as far as the wearing of the buttons was concerned 
 in his opinion on denial of rehearing judge kleinfeld on the ninth circuit made the point that at criminal trials and i suppose at other trials it is an accepted feature of the proceeding that there are going to be spectators who identify with one or the other party and there may be relatives of the defendant in a criminal case there may be relatives of the victims and its apparent from their behavior what they think about the case and which side should win and thats sort of a baseline that has to be accepted in judging not whether wearing buttons is good as a whether we think it would be good if we were announcing a court rule but whether theres a violation of due process do you accept that 
 justice alito i do as far as it goes accept that as a baseline i think judge bea in a separate dissent likened it to a family wedding that we all know who is here for which party that we have no quarrel with 
 so what is it about these particular buttons thats reflected in the record that shows that it goes significantly beyond what would be inferred just from that rather common feature of trials 
 i think in looking at the rule again derived from williams and flynn we dont have to go there its the risk not the reality i dont know what could be inferred and we dont know what was in the jurors minds as they saw those buttons but the point is that it could affect the outcome it is an impermissible factor that causes the possibility that the jurors verdict is based on something other than the evidence 
 why is there a greater risk why do the buttons convey involve a greater risk than the kind of behavior that judge kleinfeld was referring to 
 because you can imagine as a juror jurors are very attentive during trials that they look out into the audience and see in the jury box i mean out in the audience a group of people wearing buttons what are those buttons whats on there whats the point of theres a degree of scrutiny thats naturally going to occur by an attentive juror thats really the issue 
 lets assume risk of what thats what im puzzled by lets assume that the buttons were big enough that they could recognize that the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose murder the trial was about lets assume all that what risk is that you know during sentencing i can understand oh he caused so much grief to so many people once we found him guilty we should sock him with a stiff sentence but during the guilt trial i mean i see gee the victims family loved him a lot this guy must be guilty that doesnt follow at all in the guilt phase i dont see how that can have any effect on the jury 
 well justice scalia i think its a risk of a factor that is not subjected to adversarial testing it is the possibility that it could have an impact 
 i dont see the possibility you tell me that 
 here you have 
 is there a real possibility that a jury is going to say since this mans this victims family loved him so much this guy must be guilty 
 but thats only one possible message of this button and again thats where im contrasting the risk versus the reality its that it could be any message thats sent 
 do you have to depend on there being a message isnt it enough if there is an influence that is conveyed i mean what i thought the problem was was that there was as a result of the obtrusive wearing of the button that it created a risk simply of an emotional approach to the determination of guilt or innocence the jurors are more likely to feel sorry for the family members sitting there a few feet away from them perhaps they may be more likely to feel sorry for the victim but certainly for the family members and it would be that improper influence of emotionalism as opposed to a particular message that is the problem here isnt it 
 i dont disagree with that 
 do you accept that 
 i do accept that and i dont need to rely on a message i would agree with the argument that you have advanced 
 okay 
 the i think it is important here to look at the fact that no party in this case that the state has not advanced that this is a practice that should be endorsed or adopted it is clear that everyone involved has had a concern with the wearing of buttons or any other kind of introduction into the proceeding that would otherwise not be subject to meaningful adversarial testing and i think thats the problem in this case and i do believe if you look closely at the state court opinion in this case you will see that the court belows opinion was correct that they did not tease out of the opinion or parse or apply any kind of tendentious reading when you look at exactly what the state court decided 
 well thats just because we havent had a first amendment case yet i mean we just have parties arguing in the context of the criminal trial for the defendant for the state lets wait until the aclu brings a case about people who want to wear buttons in court then you are going to have people arguing people ought to be able to wear buttons just as they can wear a shirt that says blip the draft 
 but this court i think could craft an opinion that addresses that concern without the need for simply awaiting that day 
 counsel im not sure you are right that nobody was concerned about everybody thought the factors were wrong i dont think the trial judge did the trial judge said he saw no possibility of prejudice 
 and i misspoke you are correct justice stevens the trial judge did reach that conclusion if there are no other questions i would 
 thank you mr fermino 
 thank you 
 mr ott you have one minute remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice if the court has no further questions i would submit this matter 
 thank you mr ott the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first today in washington v recuenco mr whisman 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court when a judge rather than a jury decides a fact that increases the defendants punishment above the applicable standard range the sixth amendments jury trial right is violated this is true regardless of whether the fact is called an element or whether it is called a sentencing factor because elements and sentencing factors are functionally equivalent under the sixth amendment of the united states constitution it follows that the same harmless error rule that applies to missing or misdescribed elements should also apply to missing or misdescribed sentencing enhancements in a series of washington decisions the washington supreme court has held that harmless error analysis may never be conducted as to a missing or misdescribed sentencing enhancement simply because it is called a sentencing enhancement this rule of absolute prohibition is inconsistent with this courts jurisprudence and should be corrected before i go on however to explain the legal basis and the flaws in the legal reasoning of the washington state supreme court i would like to take a brief moment to address a few state law issues that have been raised by the respondents brief the first is the question of whether or not at all in washington we can at present seek deadly weapon enhancements or more specifically firearm enhancements it was alleged in the respondents brief that we cannot and id just point out to the court that there is no authority in washington for that proposition and so asking this court to simply affirm the the firearm enhancement that was originally imposed in this case does not constitute imposing a sentence that would any way be inconsistent with washington law 
 on on that point i have i have one question at page N a of the petition appendix the washington supreme courts opinion is set forth and in the course of that opinion it says to the contrary when defense counsel argued the definition should have been submitted to the jury the prosecutor explicitly stated that the method under which the state is alleging and the jury found assault was committed was by the use of a deadly weapon and then he goes on to say in the crime charged in the enhancement the state alleged there is no element of a firearm the element is assault with a deadly weapon i dont this was at the sentencing proceeding i take it 
 i believe thats correct your honor 
 yes because i couldnt find it in the sentencing proceeding 
 in the in a subsequent or nearly subsequent breath the prosecutor then asked for the enhancement the N month enhancement that applies for firearms i think what you are seeing there is that the prosecutor was responding to the to defense counsels use of the term element and in in the year N before apprendi before blakely we never would have used that term as applied to a sentencing enhancement we just didnt think of it that way now we have since changed our thinking obviously after apprendi but i think if you on the on the overall point if you look at defense counsels comments beginning with the comments pretrial where he notes that i can see no relevance to to the admission of a different gun then he comments ms recuenco was threatened with a N automatic with a clip regarding the charge in particular counsel at ja page N says the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under a theory of firearm at ja N counsel said the firearm is an element of this offense as it has been pleaded and argued to the jury and evidently perhaps obviously proven to the jury so 
 it does sound as if he thinks there was the prosecutor thought there was no error a deadly weapon is a deadly weapon and then 
 thats right and and i think your honor that stems from the from the way the statutes are structured beginning many many years ago in washington we had what we called a deadly weapon enhancement and so there was no distinction made between any kind of weapon in N the law changed there was a distinction made as to firearms the the penalty was increased as to firearms and so beginning that time there was a material distinction depending on the weapon that was used but i think that 
 was deadly weapon still an enhancement at that point or was deadly weapon part of the definition of a new crime 
 deadly weapon was still called an enhancement your honor under the statute and so the statute defined deadly weapon very generally and then in the punishment section the punishment provisions which specifically were formerly under section N of the sentencing reform act now its been renumbered to be N under that provision you have two provisions one which provides the punishment for deadly for firearms and under this for this case that would be N years and then as to the rest it says if someone was armed with a deadly weapon other than a firearm you have a lesser penalty so as i say i think that for a long time we have treated in washington we have treated all of these things as deadly weapons but recognized that if it was a firearm the penalty was greater than if it were something other than a firearm 
 i thought the deadly weapon the definition of deadly weapon that that could include a revolver or a pistol you you seem to be describing now deadly weapon thats one thing and that excludes guns and then firearm a discrete category but i thought that deadly weapon includes at least pistols and revolvers 
 a firearm includes pistols and revolvers because a firearm is something anything from which a projectile is fired so 
 but but didnt the deadly weapon definition of deadly weapon include firearms 
 thats the way it was defined to the jury in this case thats correct justice ginsburg it was it was the the jury instructions went to the jury to find deadly weapon as a firearm and over and over the court reiterated especially in the instructions conference that the theres no question but that the only weapon here is a firearm and so they used the simplified version of the instructions 
 wasnt 
 but with a N N year enhancement or i thought that that could apply in a case where the deadly weapon was a gun 
 no our our position your honor is that it cannot that if you either have a firearm or you have no enhancement whatsoever if the only way that a that a gun could be a its its because of the language other than a firearm so in other words you have either a firearm and a N year enhancement or you have as i say no no weapon enhancement at all so in other words 
 well would it be either proper or required by the washington trial court to tell the jury ladies and gentlemen of the jury the charge is assault there is also the possibility of a sentence enhancement its a N year enhancement if its a deadly weapon its a N year enhancement if its a firearm and a pistol is a firearm would the judge err if he did that or another way of putting the same question would it be proper for the judge to leave out the N year deadly weapon instruction and just instruct you can you must determine whether its an assault and you must determine whether theres a N year enhancement for the use of a firearm 
 we believe thats exactly what the court did in this case your honor by by instructing the jury that deadly weapon is firearm in washington we never tell the jury 
 no no my hypothetical is he says its a N year enhancement if the deadly weapon is a firearm thats what im asking is in effect under washington law is it error if the judge allows the definition of deadly weapon also to go to the jury so it can find a lesser included offense 
 well there there are two parts to the answer let me answer that one first there our position is there is no lesser included offense of a firearm thats still a deadly weapon and if you look at state v olney olney that was one of the cases reversed in the recuenco case you will see that that they explain why thats the case in other words its either a firearm or theres no enhancement whatsoever the the other part of the question i wanted to just clarify is that in washington we would not be telling the jury the length of time that that the defendant would face 
 well then you are saying the instruction here was proper 
 im saying that the instructions that went to the jury correct were were proper what was improper in this case is that the special verdict form did not sufficiently or specifically enough preserve the jurys verdict so that in other words when the jury passed on this case and returned a verdict form that said deadly weapon that did not expressly encompass the firearm and so and that was that was the the mistake that was made in this case we should have submitted a verdict form to the jury that would that would let a jury expressly describe what the verdict was 
 could you could you clarify one thing for me i just want to be sure i have it in mind correctly is it correct that the firearm has to be an operable firearm 
 that portion of the washington law your honor isnt isnt crystal clear but what i can say is that thats not in this case because trial counsel at at trial in more than one occasion specifically said it was irrelevant to this case what we have to prove is that the firearm was a real gun and 
 but is just again im not trying to find out the answer to what happened here but just as a matter of what the law provides is it conceivable that a a gun which was not operable could nevertheless be a deadly weapon because it can be used as a club 
 in that circumstance yes your honor 
 it could be 
 but but obviously as counsel on page ja N and at ja N counsel very specifically said the state tries to say that the nonworking firearm would also be the basis for this offense and certainly it can be and then at at page N they say obviously the question of whether it actually worked or not would be irrelevant under the law so the strictly speaking the question of operability wasnt before the jury we did have to prove that it was real and of course there was never any dispute about that the defendants by the defendants own testimony for example in the in the transcript at page N that would be volume N on N or N or N page N the defendant spoke at some length about the fact that he was worried about his children getting a hold of this gun there were significant safety concerns at page N he talked about how he locks it up all the time 
 would you explain again why it was irrelevant whether the gun was operable or not 
 operability your honor is is there were a series of cases that that arose in washington having to do with with a gun that was basically a real gun but that there was something technically wrong with it and those series of cases discussed how soon it could be rendered operable to make it still constitute a real gun but i think thats really kind of an esoteric area of the law 
 but to be a real gun it has to be operable 
 well thats what the what the cases have said is that it only has to be ready could be made ready to to fire in a short amount of time yes as i say thats simply not in this case because counsel conceded this gun that operability wasnt an issue here all we had to prove was that it was a real gun 
 now did you have to prove that because as as i have assumed the charge included the statement that he had used a handgun was that the term used 
 yes your honor 
 okay 
 the charging document said the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon which establishes the general category and then to wit a handgun as i say there there was no issue either either pretrial or throughout the course of the trial that counsel knew precisely what he was facing 
 but all that the jury found was deadly weapon because thats all they were asked to find 
 thats right they only used the terms deadly weapon your honor and thats why in the washington state supreme court we conceded that technically speaking the jurys verdict didnt encompass the firearm finding the express verdict didnt encompass the firearm finding but under the facts and circumstances of this case its our our view that that error even though it could be an error is harmless 
 well you you could it could be argued that it not only didnt encompass the firearm finding but it excluded the firearm finding if as you tell us there are two categories one being deadly weapon which does not include firearm and the other being firearm wouldnt you say that the jury verdict positively contradicted 
 i think your honor justice scalia if you imagine a situation as justice kennedy was posing where the jury was presented with two options and they were going to choose one or the other you might be able to make that argument but here the jury was presented only with the definition saying deadly weapon is a firearm whether loaded or not and under those circumstances and under the circumstances where the only weapon associated with this assault is a firearm the only thing that they could have premised their decision on was the firearm so as i say its not as though they were choosing either or in justice kennedys hypothetical you might have had that situation 
 is the jury given a copy of the information 
 they are ordinarily read a copy of the information your honor at the start of the case i dont recall that being transcribed in the in the transcript as as the court has it that is the ordinary course of proceedings in in the respondents brief there is a fair amount of time spent on distinguishing this case or or trying to analogize this case actually to charging defects and as i have indicated already for the past few minutes i believe that this case simply doesnt present that issue because it was readily apparent that this defendant was fully advised of what he was facing now if there were other defects if there were true defects in the charging document or if the defendant was surprised by the sentence that the judge ultimately imposed then we would have to analyze separately analyze whether or not the charging document was sufficient and under this courts jurisprudence and under washington law that is a separate analysis a separate analysis 
 why was deadly weapon put in by the prosecutor at all if if you are right that this is not a deadly weapon case this is strictly a firearm case its not a lesser included here the prosecutor charged deadly weapon 
 correct 
 to wit a handgun and then the special verdict form doesnt say one word about firearm so couldnt the defendant expect well they charged the main thing they charged me with deadly weapon and they asked the jury to find deadly weapon 
 and and i think to answer that question your honor again we have to step back to the year N and preapprendi et cetera at that time there were a series of cases meggyesy olney and rai rai that that are overturned quite frankly by the recuenco opinion where the appellate courts had quite expressly said that it was sufficient to submit the deadly weapon verdict form in that form to a jury where its clear that the only weapon at issue was a firearm in each one of those cases that was what was done and in fact in at least one of them the victim was shot so there couldnt be any question so there was there was a wellestablished practice in washington law at the time of proving that sort of thing now its true that the more thorough practice the more precise practice would have been to submit a verdict form that said firearm but that wasnt done in this case but it wasnt done i believe pursuant to those cases unless the court has any additional questions id like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal 
 thank you counsel ms millett 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in neder this court held that the failure to submit an element to a jury an element of a crime to a jury is subject to harmless error analysis because it is a nonstructural trial error in apprendi and blakely this court held that the sixth amendment right to trial by jury recognizes no distinction between elements that set a maximum punishment sentencing elements and elements of the underlying offense for that reason the failure to submit an element that sets the sentence to the maximum sentence available should be subject to exact same harmless error analysis that was applied in neder the exact same constitutional value and constitutional right is at stake the exact same analysis of the effects of the error will be applied by the court and its the same sort of discrete error in time that you had in neder theres no functional distinction between neder in addition in schriro v summerlin this court held that the failure to submit a sentencing element to a jury is not the type of error that calls into question the fairness accuracy or reliability of the underlying proceeding in cotton this court held that that same type of error does not impugn the integrity public reputation or fairness of judicial proceedings and in mitchell 
 ms millett can i ask you this one question would there ever be a case where it was not harmless error when the judge makes the finding isnt it wouldnt it be reasonable for the appellate court to assume well if the judge made the finding its probably supported by the evidence and presumably the jury would have come out the same way 
 no i dont i dont think thats true justice stevens that there will be times i dont think this is one of those cases but there will be 
 but there might be a rare case but in about N percent of the cases wouldnt it be true that the fact the judge made the finding is pretty good evidence that the jury would have made the same finding 
 i think it will depend on whether the evidence was disputed before the judge in a in a in the federal system would have been sentencing hearing and remember sometimes 
 the judge doesnt have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt does he 
 exactly exactly justice scalia theres not only there may be disputed evidence but the standard may be different its not clear whether it was here but at least as to some factors its clearly not enough that theres sufficient evidence to support the judges determination the question would be whether theres any a jury could have found any doubt or when its clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the outcome would have been the same but i do think in a case like this its important to keep in mind that its this case illustrates that these things are not categorically or necessarily unamenable to harmless error review and in fact what would happen in cases like this and a lot in the federal system where you have undisputed uncontested facts and we know that because they had the incentive to contest them at a sentencing proceeding and so to hold that automatic reversal is required would mean it would go back for a retrial that would have nothing to do nothing to do with the element that was not decided by the jury that would be undisputed theres not going to be any contest back here that the firearm the semiautomatic that was handed to the jury loaded and passed around to the jury was a firearm it would just be a second bite at the apple to contest things that were decided properly and beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury consistent with the defendants constitutional rights 
 what what do we do about the problem that is raised by by counsel on the other side that washington law is such or at least at the time the briefs were written washington law is such as they understand it that the that the issue could never properly have been submitted to the jury and and therefore if if washington courts are going to follow washington law in every case in which a firearm is an issue the case is going to be handled exactly like this its not the firearm issue is not going to the jury the firearm determination will be made by the judge if the state of washington decides not to amend its law we would have a situation in which in effect apprendi is read out of the the constitutional law simply by state procedure and in every case the the response would have to be harmless error analysis on your theory that is a pretty neat way to undercut apprendi is that not a good reason to say we shouldnt have harmless error analysis 
 no its not justice souter first of all the hughes opinion on which they rely is crystal clear that the only thing the court found was that there was no procedure to reempanel a jury on remand and i point the court to page N thats a pN d citation and N in the washington reporter citation where the court specifically said we are only talking about remand and not deciding whether these things could ever be submitted to a jury in the first instance 
 so you are im sorry you are saying their argument is wrong in effect as a as a statement of washington law 
 i think thats right but even if it werent if if you had some state that decided not to fix its law in light of apprendi and blakely i expect that what would happen is defendants would bring sort of there would be a facial constitutionality problem with any attempt to prosecute under that and that may be the way to deal with it theres no question of willfulness here this is decided at a time when in good faith preapprendi even this isnt even the apprendi or blakely window that it was acceptable to have this sort of twotier proceedings much like we are used to in sort of a death penalty context and theres theres been no im sorry 
 i dont understand what what you meant by a facial unconstitutional facially unconstitutional problem you mean a federal court would enjoin the criminal prosecution because its unconstitutional on its face we wouldnt do that would we 
 i cant imagine the federal court would intervene in an ongoing state proceeding 
 neither can i 
 but state courts are perfectly capable of of applying and we assume that they would apply and adhere to constitutional law from this court 
 so that thats not really an adequate answer that it would be facially unconstitutional 
 well my understanding was that the washington law washington legislature didnt amend its law to say that this could be submitted to a jury and then every defendant at the outset of the case would say you need to you know strike the indictment dismiss this charge 
 a motion in limine kind of 
 right i think there would be a way im im confident there would be a way to deal with it and i dont think the way to deal with it is to assume that thats a reason to make harmless error not available to these types of errors across the board 
 the assumption of the hypothetical is i take it that the washington state judges would deliberately violate our holding of a matter of constitutional law in imposing the enhancement 
 they would and i think thats not a fair assumption and its certainly not the way to decide whether harmless error analysis should apply i mean blakely has been on the books for a couple of years neder has been out there for N years and we havent seen people deliberately trying to get around peoples sixth amendment rights 
 do you agree in this case that the court did have the obligation to submit a special verdict form indicating that the defendant asking whether the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon 
 yes thats required by washington law the jury 
 no as a matter a constitutional matter 
 that 
 suppose the suppose the judge didnt ask about deadly weapon at all just just asked whether theres an assault 
 well the its assault in the second degree which requires itself requires use of a deadly weapon so it wouldnt even be assault in the second degree under washington law without the jury finding a deadly weapon 
 but you so so there had to be an instruction that there was an assault in the second degree 
 there had there had to be a deadly weapon to have assault in the second degree and then and i may not get all the nuances of washington law but then the jury had to have the sentencing enhancement had to make a separate finding that the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time im not sure again if its essentially redundant in second degree assault cases or not its a little confusing but the the law required that you find a deadly weapon but it wasnt which deadly weapon it was just a baseline eligibility and then it was up to the court to decide which deadly weapon which would then dictate the sentence and one other point id like to make clear is theres been some argument that this case is different from neder because you have a completed defense that is no different at all you had a completed verdict for a nonoffense in neder and the distinction between a judge making findings that make a verdict that support a nonoffense into offense is not one that makes a structural difference and in carella v california rose v clark you had elements that stood on the fault line between lesser included offenses and greater included offenses and now there they werent missing they werent technically missing elements but they were elements that were subject to mandatory presumptions by the jury and yet this court said that they are subject to harmless error analysis now obviously the type of the element is going to affect the governments ability to prevail under harmless error analysis and there may well be times when the government will not succeed in that process especially as you get elements that are more central to you know the the crime and and traditional elements like the intent issues that were at issue in both carella and in rose v clark the other point i wanted i wanted to make is that the fact that the jury verdict form here came back consistent with with the or the jury verdict form in neder came back with the completed crime shouldnt make a difference the change in the that jury verdict only came back because of a second mistake the jury was wrongly and mistakenly told that if it found elements a b and c it would it would establish a a completed crime the fact that in this case you dont have that second error isnt again a difference that makes one error structural and the other nonstructural the important thing is that the right is the same the cost the right to the same the ability of courts to analyze this error is the same and on the other hand a rule of automatic reversal will impose an enormous cost on victims and the public thank you 
 thank you ms millett mr link 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the washington supreme court correctly held that as a matter of federal and state law the error in this case as in blakely cases generally could not be subjected to harmless error analysis i think its important to clarify that as a matter of state law and and as recognized by the washington supreme court in its decision in recuenco the deadly weapon enhancement and the firearm enhancement are in fact lesser and greater offenses of one another we know that based on on what what action the court took on remand it didnt dismiss the the enhancement altogether it said the only thing that could be done on remand was imposition of the lesser enhancement 
 how could it be lesser included when as we have heard firearm does im sorry deadly weapon does not include firearm if deadly weapon included firearm then certainly im sorry deadly weapon would would could be a lesser included offense somehow but the two are exclusive categories arent they 
 under washington law its important to understand that under washington law a handgun is is a deadly weapon per se but that handgun is only a firearm if the state establishes the additional fact that it has the capacity to fire which is which is why the statute the deadly weapon statute and the definition of deadly weapon in in the statutory provision specifically includes handguns revolvers and other guns 
 but if it has the capacity 
 but the statute does say deadly weapon other than a firearm 
 the definition statue of of deadly weapon doesnt its 
 but the enhancement section does 
 its a separate provision on the enhancement or excuse me as to the length of the enhancement that would be imposed does 
 well do you think in this case youd be entitled to a lesser included offense instruction as a matter of law 
 i believe that as a matter of washington law the answer would be yes and again i think it turns on the fact that theres this additional factor additional element of capacity to fire that differentiates a handgun from a firearm 
 well was there any evidence that it didnt have the capacity to fire 
 there was no evidence i think to suggest that it did 
 you are not entitled to you are not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction for which theres no evidence 
 under washington law a defendant gets a lesser included instruction so long as the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to him would support the fact that the lesser was was included now it cant turn on whether or not the state or whether the jury simply disbelieves the states proof but it can when looking at the the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant look at holes in the states evidence such as the fact that there is no evidence before this jury about this guns capacity to fire 
 no but there there is evidence from which the jury could find that it was a real gun and in the absence of any indication to the contrary that is competent evidence for the jury to use in concluding that it would function like a real gun its not they didnt have to put in further technical evidence an issue might have been raised i mean your the the defendant might have come up and and presented evidence to the effect that it was only a starter pistol in which case okay there would be a real issue but in the absence of any reason to doubt that the handgun was what it purported to be there would be no reason to there would be no requirement of further evidence about functionality would there be 
 as a matter of washington law and as of the fact that this is indeed an element of a greater offense there is a requirement on the state to come forward with additional proof of the capacity to fire 
 whats whats your authority i mean that doesnt seem as a matter of factual common sense that doesnt seem required is is there a washington case that requires that 
 there is not its the statutory language of the deadly weapon enhancement itself 
 and what exactly in the language is it that you hang your hat on 
 the fact that the deadly weapon enhancement can apply specifically to a handgun regardless of the manner in which its used for instance it a a handgun that does not have the capacity to fire could be used to to strike an individual and in that context would be a deadly weapon regardless of whether it was likely to cause a serious bodily harm 
 no no question but if there but if there is no reason to question its apparent functionality i mean you know its a handgun it looks like a handgun somebody is holding it like a handgun there there is no reason it seems to me as a matter of fact or based on the statute to doubt that it would be functional and therefore it would seem to me that the proof would be competent that it was a functioning handgun in the absence of any question raised 
 again if we compare the definition of a deadly weapon under washington law with the definition of a firearm under washington law a handgun is by definition a deadly weapon but a handgun is not by definition a firearm 
 counsel you asked for an instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm under that provision of washington law does the firearm have to be operable as well 
 it would seem that the the same definition of firearm would apply 
 so you ask for an instruction assuming that the firearm at issue in this case was operable 
 no again i believe that he he asks an individual could ask for an instruction in that case and still maintain that the state hasnt met the proof of of establishing even the lesser and theres nothing tactically contradictory about doing so if if one if an attorney can convince the court to to allow the jury to consider a lesser and then still challenge that the proof of that lesser 
 but if the firearm were not operable you would not have been entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm correct 
 if the firearm if looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the state he may not have been entitled under the the factual prong that that the washington courts use on lesser and greater offenses 
 lets say a new case comes up tomorrow and the person is charged in an information with assault in the second degree and its clearly alleged in the information that a firearm was used but then when the case is submitted to the jury the judge just forgets to charge on the firearm factor or element would that could that be harmless error is that any different from the case thats before us 
 i think that if the parties litigate the question of whether or not it was an assault with with a firearm as opposed to litigate the offense of assault with a deadly weapon and then theres merely an omission from the elements i think thats a different case but i dont 
 well its a different is it a materially different case 
 i think its a materially 
 is it just like neder or is it different from neder 
 i think that scenario would be closer to neder but i think thats a different scenario than what we have here and i think the reason why its different here is because the jury returned under washington law returned a complete verdict there is no there was no error in either the verdict or in the jury instructions as a 
 take justice alitos case and nobody litigated it because nobody doubted that it was a loaded gun now whats the result 
 in that scenario if the evidence is overwhelming as as perhaps it was in neder one might assume that the error is uncontroverted but 
 all right so so therefore its harmless so therefore we use harmless error analysis so whats the difference between that case and this case 
 because i think unlike neder this case involves a jury or excuse me the a the wrong entity has determined the defendants guilt not on the crime at issue 
 yes i quite i quite agree with you that there is the difference that in the alito case as amended it all happened before the jury got its verdict in our case it happened after the jury reached a verdict now absolutely true and my question of course is why does that matter 
 because in a scenario where the jury has been properly instructed and has returned a complete verdict 
 no no it was improperly instructed the judge forgot to give this instruction about the nature of the firearm i take it at least my case the judge forgets to instruct about the firearm he just forgets all right and then the jury goes out it comes back and the lawyer says judge i handed you the instruction why didnt you give it he says oh my god i forgot now does harmless error apply to that case 
 i think that scenario is closer to neder than it is to this case 
 and i want to know why that matters because the only thing i have tried to create the hypothetical to matter is the one thing happens before the jury goes out and the other happens after and why does that matter 
 i think it matters because in a scenario like this as opposed to either neder or or the hypothetical the only offense that has ever been litigated to the parties or by the parties to the jury was the lesser offense the parties understood that only the lesser offense was at issue and we know that because in response to mr recuencos motion to vacate the state told the judge you arent required to give the firearm instruction because thats not an element of either the substantive charge or the enhancement 
 no but its also the case as i understand it and as counsel on the other side confirmed a few moments ago that the charge specifically specified that a handgun had been used so this is not a case as i think you were suggesting in which there has never been a charge of the offense plus the enhancement they now claim the the problem was in the jury verdict not in the charge not in notice to the defendant and if thats the case why isnt it just like neder 
 because again i go back to washington law and the fact that handgun is alleged in the information does not establish that its a firearm because a handgun 
 well a a firearm as i understand it is defined to include a pistol or a revolver is that correct 
 it is 
 all right isnt the natural reading of or understanding of the word handgun that its a pistol or a revolver i mean isnt that what people would normally take it to mean 
 that may be but as a matter of washington law thats not the case and it may defy common sense but thats what it does 
 yes but you are asking for a you are asking for a federal constitutional ruling and right now if i understand you correctly you are arguing that you ought to win because if you dont win as a matter of federal constitutional law we would be condoning a verdict for an offense that was never charged but if in fact handgun is properly read properly understood to mean a pistol or a revolver and thats what a firearm thats thats what a firearm is is defined to include under washington law then in fact the offense has been charged the enhancement has been charged and as a matter of federal constitutional law it seems to me that ought to be enough to bring it within neder regardless of what the quirks of washington law may be 
 if in fact the allegation of handgun is sufficient to bring it in the context of neder then there there was no error at all there would not have been a blakely violation in this case and the wrong the state was wrong all along to concede that there was because apprendi doesnt just involve doesnt just say that sentencing elements are the equivalent of elements in the traditional sense it says they are the equivalent of elements of a greater offense and the state concedes and the washington supreme court has found that in fact there was a blakely violation in this case 
 and thats because it it didnt go to the jury 
 thats because the judge as opposed the jury 
 yes 
 decided mr recuencos guilt on a greater offense 
 right 
 so so as a matter of washington law mr recuencos jury was properly charged and properly returned a verdict on the only offense litigated and that was the lesser offense of assault two with a deadly weapon 
 well when you say its not litigated do you mean simply that nobody none of the witnesses none of the counsel in argument disputed that a handgun was there in other words it was just one of those things everybody understood is that what you mean when you say it wasnt litigated 
 what i mean by saying it wasnt litigated is that it was the understanding of the parties at trial that the firearm element was not at issue because that had not been charged that that was not the charge in front of the jury 
 and and what do you what do you base that statement on in other words i i think you are now arguing that the understanding was that although it looked as though the the most serious enhancement had been charged the understanding of the parties was that it had not been if thats your argument what is your basis for saying that 
 again i could point to the the prosecutors response in the motion to vacate i can point to the courts judgment and sentence which i dont have the cite for right off the my head but it is in the joint appendix on that form as is common in washington there are two boxes for the court to check one says that a verdict regarding a deadly weapon or excuse me that a firearm other than a deadly weapon was returned the other says that a a excuse me one says that a verdict form for finding that the person was armed with a firearm was returned the other says that it was merely the verdict form for being armed with a deadly weapon other than the firearm the trial 
 counsel what your trial counsel said was that the im quoting from the joint appendix page N the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under the theory of firearm it seems inconsistent with your representation that nobody had an idea that they were trying this under the theory of a firearm 
 i think its it would be equally inconsistent with the states current position if we look at ja N where the prosecutors response was we didnt need that instruction because firearm was not an element of the crime charged 
 do you think it would have been error in this case based on the evidence presented and the way the the case was argued would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury that if they found that there was a firearm involved they should make a they could make a a finding on that 
 well its interesting because post recuenco after the washington supreme courts ruling in this case yes that would be an error because after the washington supreme courts decision in this case what they said is that 
 but as a constitutional matter would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury in this case based on this evidence that they could return a verdict that a firearm was used as part of the assault 
 as a matter of constitutional error no i dont believe it would have been but as but under washington law it was a verdict they couldnt as we know from recuenco now its a verdict they couldnt have returned 
 ms millett tells us that that only applies on remand under under the hughes case 
 under washington law when a court as i think is common under federal law whenever a court interprets a statute determines what it means that is what the statute has always mean means and and that is what that statute will mean in the future until such time as the legislature amends it as of this date while the the legislature has amended the statutes at issue in hughes it has done nothing with respect to this statute so as it stands now based on the recognition of the washington supreme court that at the time of the entry of that decision there was no provision to submit that question to a jury in mr recuencos case there was also no provision to submit it to a jury in another case because prior to recuenco the only means by which the firearm enhancement could be obtained was pursuant to the decisions in meggyesy rai and olney and that was the very manner that was used here and that was the very procedure that the washington supreme court found violative of blakely 
 mr link will you just maybe i i should know this but the information charges an assault in the second degree using the deadly weapon if they had charged use of a firearm rather than a deadly weapon what would the crime have been would that also have been assault in the second degree 
 well thats an interesting twist under washington law because the deadly weapon is is actually two elements of assault two under the substantive offense its a component of of assault and also an element of the but to allege a firearm it is possible that the substantive offense could have been elevated to assault one its also possible that it could have simply been an assault two with a firearm enhancement so 
 the firearm enhancement itself would not covert it from second degree to first degree 
 no and and i think this illustrates a point under washington law the state could charge assault three with a firearm enhancement in in a case in which a person used a gun theres nothing under washington law that requires the prosecutor to charge the greatest offense theres nothing under federal constitutional law that even if that greater offense is charged that the jury must return a verdict on that greater offense in fact the jury as the circuit breaker in the system has always always has the right regardless of the strength of the evidence and regardless of of what the trial court might view as the correctness of the charge to return the verdict on the lesser 
 you say regardless of the strength of the evidence how about no evidence at all 
 i think this courts jurisprudence on on questions of of lenity and interpreting jury verdicts would allow a jury to return a verdict that that isnt necessarily supported by the evidence its the understanding that its their 
 well the question is whether or not it requires it 
 i dont think this court requires that the jury but i think what what im trying to say i guess is that it requires not requires it it imposes deference on the trial courts that they cannot secondguess the jury that because the jury is always free to return a verdict on the lesser offense there simply cannot be a situation in which the trial court based on its own assessment of the facts gets to enter the greater 
 well doesnt isnt that true in neder as well 
 i think in neder neder is a different case and for a number of reasons unlike neder there has never been a claim that theres any incorrectness in either the verdict in the charge or in the jury instructions in fact mr recuenco from the outset had no reason to suggest that there was anything wrong because the state was free to charge him with the lesser offense and they did there would be no motive on his part to say excuse me your honor i think im really guilty of a greater offense please ask the state to amend its information 
 you keep saying a lesser offense and a greater offense but under washington law theres just one offense isnt that right its second its assault in the second degree 
 its assault in the second degree with the additional deadly weapon enhancement 
 and if we accept going back to our earlier exchange if we accept the proposition that charging that he used a handgun was sufficient to charge a firearm then the charge against him was assault in the second degree with the maximum enhancement for use of a firearm 
 again had 
 you you and i may disagree on on how to read how to understand firearm but if you read it the way i just suggested then the charge was assault two with the maximum enhancement isnt that correct 
 i think if the information and and the instructions were read in that manner the state was wrong to concede that there was blakely error here at all because if as a matter of law a handgun is automatically a firearm there would have been no blakely violation at all but thats not the case 
 well i thought the i thought the reason they conceded the blakely violation was that in the instructions to the jury the instruction only went to deadly weapon and the instruction did not specifically refer to firearm i thought thats why they they stipulated that there was a blakely error as a matter of the fact about the instruction is is my description correct 
 im not sure i can answer right i believe the instruction mentioned handgun the instruction 
 all right and it didnt it didnt use the lets put it this way it didnt use the word firearm right 
 no it did not 
 thats thats why they conceded a blakely error 
 but again if if under washington law a handgun were automatically a firearm the instruction wasnt erroneous at all 
 well but the special verdict form still was 
 but the instructions for use of the special verdict form would not have been and and its because of that that quirk in washington law and the state offered us some suggestion of why that quirk exists the deadly weapon provisions have been a part of the washington sentencing scheme since its enactment in the midN s it was only about N years later that the additional enhancements for firearm were added and and they were enacted by by a citizens initiative and theres very little reference between the two of them but they still exist together because theres nothing that suggests again that the state couldnt allege the lesser offense even where a handgun is is involved because it is the difference between a handgun with nothing more and a handgun that has the capacity to fire and its that additional component of capacity to fire that truly creates the greater and lesser offense in this case 
 may i just clarify one other thing capacity to fire doesnt mean it had to be loaded though 
 capacity to fire does not mean per se operability it it means that this instrument has the capacity to fire whether or not 
 an unloaded gun could be a firearm 
 an an unloaded gun could be a firearm so long as it has the capacity to fire 
 in the charging document where it says that he was armed with a deadly weapon to wit a handgun and then it cites the washington statutes those citations include the N year enhancement provision 
 the the citation to what is now 
 it cites rcw N aN and N aN is one of is one of those the N year enhancement 
 N is is the definition of deadly weapon the other one excuse me N 
 N aN 
 that includes both the firearm the additional time for firearm enhancement as well as the time for the deadly weapon enhancement 
 so it includes the N years 
 it it cites both depending on what subsection its citing so it doesnt necessarily identify one as opposed to the other 
 but it does include it 
 it is in that that statute yes 
 and do you know if the information went to the jury in this case 
 as is consistent with washington law its read to the jury at at the outset but it it would be inconsistent i think with practice in washington to have actually submitted the the information to the jury in a situation like this where the wrong entity has determined a persons guilt despite the jurys complete verdict on a lesser offense the application of harmless error simply eviscerates what blakely sought to draw as the limits or excuse me as the as the outer boundaries of the jurys right and in fact it its the equivalent of a second sixth amendment violation because in each instance the jurys complete verdict on the lesser offense is being set aside in the first instance its based on the trial courts review of of the strength of the evidence and in the second instance its based on the the appellate courts review of the strength of the record to support not the jurys verdict but instead the trial courts assessment of the proper charge 
 well the other way of looking at it is its based on trying to understand what the jury meant when it said deadly weapon when the only evidence of a deadly weapon they were presented was a firearm 
 it assumes i think that that the it assumes the correctness of the judges of the trial courts assessment of the facts rather than simply accept the the jurys verdict for what it was because again as a matter of washington law mr recuenco could be found guilty of assault two with a deadly weapon even if he used what appeared to be a handgun absent some proof of capacity and again as a matter of of sixth amendment jurisprudence even had the state put together evidence establishing the capacity of the instrument to fire the jury would have been free to return a verdict on the lesser offense of deadly weapon even if it were to contradict washington law on that point the jury would 
 and in neder even if the jury had been asked to rule on materiality it could have decided not to rule according to the evidence the same argument applies in neder 
 but but again in neder the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the offense that was litigated to it and based on the parties understanding of what offense was at issue in this case that doesnt happen and again its illustrated by the prosecutors response to mr recuencos motion to vacate and its illustrated by the courts judgment and sentence which is at page N of the joint appendix where it specifically finds that the only verdict and and again doesnt question the verdict that the only verdict returned was deadly weapon other than a firearm it doesnt assume that the jury found that it was the firearm verdict it doesnt make that assumption it recognizes that verdict for what it was but based on thenexisting washington law which recuenco overturned it concluded it had to impose the firearm enhancement so theres no suggestion by either the parties or the trial court or the washington supreme court for that matter that there was anything wrong with the jury returning a verdict of deadly weapon because as a matter of washington law and as recognized by each of those those entities the jury the jury could do that and they did refusing to apply harmless error in this case doesnt require a single retrial of a single individual unlike the normal case unlike neder itself in in those cases had harmless error not applied the defendants would have been entitled to a new trial thats not true after blakely at best what would happen is is defendants would be remanded back to to the various trial courts for the reentry of the sentence thats supported by the the jurys verdict there will be no need to conduct new trials there will be no need to do anything other than that simple ministerial act there simply is no prudential reason there wont be the flood of of retrials or or the prison doors thrown open for for people to walk free with no convictions 
 well i i take it washington wouldnt have the option suppose that you prevail washington doesnt have the option to give him a whole new trial do they because theres been double jeopardy i take it 
 as it exists now and based on the washington supreme courts decision in hughes and recuenco those individuals sentenced before the washington legislature amended the act would simply be entitled to have their cases remanded back for entry of a conviction based on the jurys verdict 
 what im saying you dont concede do you that washington would have the option to retry him to try to obtain the N year enhancement 
 i i certainly dont 
 i wouldnt think so 
 and both as a matter of double jeopardy and as a matter of washington law i dont think that that would could occur the washington supreme court correctly held that harmless error analysis could not apply where the trial court has set aside the jurys complete verdict on a lesser offense in favor of a judgment on the greater both as a matter of state and federal law and mr recuenco would ask this court to affirm that decision 
 thank you counsel mr whisman you have N minutes remaining 
 mr whisman can i can i ask you a hypothetical which i think puts in starker form what the what your colleague here says this case involves suppose that that you have a statute a murder statute which applies to the murder of a single individual but but you have another statute with a death penalty called aggravated murder and its a different crime and it it requires the the killing of more than one person in in the same in the same event lets assume a trial in which somebody came into a bank with a machine gun only one person came in and five people were killed but the prosecution only brought a prosecution for simple murder okay and the jury comes back with a verdict for for simple murder certainly a judge would not be able to say well no jury could possibly have found simple murder here without also thinking that this person was guilty of of this greater offense of of aggravated murder and therefore im going to enter a judgment of aggravated murder thats what the the defense says happened here that there was just a verdict of of the lesser offense thats all the jury found it could have found more and maybe maybe in finding that it it must have thought that the greater offense also existed but it never came in with a verdict for the greater offense now tell me why what happened here is different from from the hypothetical 
 i think the key difference is the charging part of your hypothetical your hypothetical assumes this defendant was never put on notice that he was facing aggravated murder and if that were true then under your cases and under under our washington law we would analyze that as a failure of notice the and it could have any number of implications for a defendant including the evidence that they marshal at trial but also including perhaps his interest in negotiating a plea agreement if a defendant doesnt know that hes facing aggravated murder at the end so 
 well suppose under justice scalias hypothetical aggravated murder is is in the charging documents but the judge doesnt say aggravated murder when he submits it to the jury 
 then i think that is susceptible to harmless error analysis your honor and it would be there would be an open question as to whether or not of course it is harmless but then i think that we are back to the neder situation 
 but then wed have justice scalias case if this information left out the words to wit a handgun 
 you would be closer to justice scalias case justice stevens yes although under washington law we analyze the charging document and the sufficiency of it and ask whether or not it was the words used sufficiently appraised the defendant but i think the defendant would have a stronger argument for the fact that he didnt know what he was facing if you had that hypothetical 
 and those are the sort of considerations that can be taken into account under harmless error analysis right the absence of notice the prejudice i would have put on this evidence if i had known i was accused of using a handgun 
 they can be a component of the harmless error analysis ordinarily in washington we would handle that as a charging document challenge in other words the defendant would say i was never charged with this crime and therefore i didnt marshal my evidence et cetera its a due process violation either way i dont think that the the conviction stands much chance of surviving i did want to answer first a question that had been raised by pointing the court to ja N where the defendant says my proposed instruction makes clear that the deadly weapon in question is the firearm that not that some other kind of weapon might have been deadly so i think that focuses the issue appropriately i also wanted to point out that justice alitos hypothetical is really the state v williams case that we cited at page N in our reply brief where the defendant was expressly charged firearm and the victim was shot during the course of the crime and the issue didnt go the the same verdict form as we have here in other words it said only deadly weapon was given to the jury and the washington court of appeals feeling itself bound by recuenco reversed that finding so i think that the opinion of the washington supreme court is unduly broad and should be overturned 
 thank you counsel 
 thank you your honor 
 the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in environmental defense versus duke energy corporation mr donahue 
 good morning mr chief justice and may it please the court the clean air act requires that the owner of a major emitting facility obtain a prevention of significant deterioration permit before engaging in a modification which is defined to include any physical change that increases the amount of any pollutant emitted by such source since N epas psd regulations have measured such increases in terms of actual emissions in tons per year 
 thats a disputed point i gather central to the case whether or not the regulations measured psd emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions 
 thats correct mr chief justice but the text of the regulations refers pervasively and im referring to the definition of official major modification which is in N cfr N and subsequent paragraphs of that regulation refers pervasively to actual emissions and measures emissions exclusively in tons per year 
 it is a little of an exaggeration though to say that epa has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer in fact the director of the psd program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the interpretation that opposing counsel took 
 yes justice scalia respondent has relied heavily on two early applicability determinations 
 rightly so i think i mean it was the earliest application of the regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in charge of the program 
 well justice scalia as we point out in our brief director reich does not adopt dukes theory in fact contradicts it he doesnt say that a new source performance standard modification must precede a psd major modification instead in both he relies on the express exclusion in the psd regulations for increases in hours of operation and the production rate and as epa explained in its contemporaneous official preamble that provision by its terms is an exception from the definition of physical change it is not a provision that says increase is attributable to a physical change to increased hours that are enabled by physical change are not considered the plain language of the regulation actually contradicts this reading these determinations themselves are quite ambiguous and of course they are two of dozens of such determinations 
 well whatever the reason he gave was it these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations in which duke did not participate when that challenge was brought were these were those opinions already out there 
 those opinions were out there but the plain language of the regulation and the preamble which explain that the increased hours exclusion was simply to allow companies to respond to demand and to link the coverage of psd to construction activity what we have here is a physical change in the plants massive renovations of these elaborate networks of pipes and tubes that compose a central component 
 i understand that and i think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the psd regulations but what i official am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed they dont challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor and then some years later when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation you have the jurisdictional bar 
 well justice scalia these regulations were challenged early on and there was a as the court is aware there was a settlement agreement in N to which duke was in fact a party that proposed to add the hourly rate test that is completely absent from these regulations 
 but could duke have had a challenge to the N or N regulations could they have reopened the issue at that point 
 they did in fact precisely that justice kennedy and that was resolved in the new york proceeding by the dc circuit duke didnt challenge the very prominent aspect of the N regulations which was to move away from the potential emissions test of prior 
 i dont want to jump ahead to the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about the modification substantive point first but it is not clear to me whether duke should have acted in N official N or N or all of the above 
 well the regulations were clear on their face i mean to determine the effect of N 
 thats an audacious statement 
 we have wrestled with these things for several days its disappointing to hear you tell us they are clear 
 they are clear in this respect they did not include an hourly rate test as judge posner in the cinergy opinion this summer said the argument that the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a challenge to the validity of these N regulations because they dont say it they dont provide for it and they are very specific and detailed and instead turn on actual annual emissions and the entire rationale epa offered was linked to that effort to capture real world changes in emissions 
 if they are so clear how can you account for mr reichs interpretation hes an expert in the area 
 right he misapplied he didnt adopt this theory the theory that an nsps official modification precedes at all in fact he contradicted it he misapplied in quite sort of anomalous circumstances the increased hours 
 i know you say hes wrong but if somebody in his position with his expertise can interpret the regulations in that way doesnt that show that they are not clear on their face 
 we think that this court can resolve can interpret can address the reasonableness of epas construction of the increased hours exclusion what it cant do is certainly what the fourth circuit did which is to say that the psd regulations must be the same they are obviously not the same they are different in multiple respects and certainly that challenge could have been raised and certainly that challenge was barred and of course the court of appeals expressly called the regulations irrelevant the texts and interpretations of the regulations thats exactly what a court is supposed to be doing 
 right in deciding whether the regulations are reasonable however is it proper for a court to take into account that the regulations must follow the prescription of the statute that the psd definition be the same as the nsps what is it nsps definition i mean thats a usual tool of statutory official or regulatory construction cannot a court give great weight to that in interpreting these ambiguous regulations 
 well that they are not ambiguous as to whether they are identical and to hold that they have to be is certainly an invalidation and the dc circuit of course held that the statute doesnt require identity as between the two sets of regulations and we are not here on certiorari from the new york decision we are here on an enforcement action in which a court leapt over the express limitations imposed on it declared the language of the regulations irrelevant and indeed misapplied them rather dramatically 
 well i dont think the same argument has necessarily to be made but the question still before us is how you interpret the regulations lets assume thats just a regulatory interpretation question its not a statutory question 
 right right 
 but in deciding that whatever was argued in prior cases it seems to me that we are entitled to take into account the necessity that the regulations comply with the statute and if they are ambiguous we should resolve the ambiguity in the official direction that it seems to us would provide consistency with the statute now does that violate the jurisdictional bar 
 no i have no problem with any of that if the regulations are ambiguous take into account the statutory text structure policies what the court below did of course was say it doesnt matter what the regulations say these have to be the same it forgot that in fact these regulations were very different the dc circuit said theres no statutory mandate of identity and that the and of course respondent was there in the dc circuit it was permitted to assert a challenge to this divergence as the court called it between nsps regulations and psd and the court said 
 if the regulations are ambiguous then the agency can interpret them in different ways and can change its interpretation over time of course what your friend argues happened here is that the agency changed its interpretation in the context of an enforcement program now accepting that premise what is the what should duke have done when that interpretation was changed in an enforcement program 
 accepting that premise they official could have sought an applicability determination duke knew very well what epas interpretation was because of the wepco decision epa had been and subsequent actions in fact dukes attorneys were vociferously charging that epa changed the rules and was acting ultra vires 
 mr donahue were there earlier enforcement actions in which epa was taking the position that it took in this action against duke 
 well in the wepco decision i mean epa has always taken the position that actual annual emissions is the standard under the N rules 
 but were they in fact enforcing that standard so that you said that duke could have asked for a nonapplicability ruling but at the time duke started up its 
 certainly i mean wepco was an applicability determination that was in N puerto rican cement was an applicability determination duke instead knowing that epa believed that increased utilization that is caused by physical change has to be considered under this as is prescribed in these very detailed regulations duke decided not to do that to go forward and it didnt in fact come to the state or to epa official of course the increased hours i understand the courts concern about the reich memos but epas construction of the increased hours exception is completely correct under the plain language of the regulations and in wepco the court upheld so that there was no question that not only was it consistent with the plain language but whatever reich had said the express language of the regulations was as far as the exception went there was no further confusion if those early memos caused confusion id like to reserve the balance of my time thank you 
 thank you mr donahue mr hungar 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the court of appeals exceeded its jurisdiction and misconstrued the clean air act in holding that epa was required to define the term modification identically for the separate nsps and psd programs and on the jurisdictional point id like to address the whipsaw question because in fact its quite official clear that theres no whipsaw issue here for a number of reasons its true that there are those ambiguous and cursory N statements from mr reich who was a subordinate official within epa in N the administrator of epa the head of the agency in the wepco decision the applicability determination made very clear what epas position is on the application of the hours of operation exclusion and the fact that this is an annual tons per year test thats page N of the joint appendix he made that perfectly clear and it has always been clear that that is in fact the epas official position beginning with the N preamble but again 
 should a challenge to that have been brought in the dc circuit at that time or would you have argued thats too late 
 well im not sure whether it could have been brought at that time but the fact of the matter is a challenge was brought on this issue in to the N regulations true duke didnt assert it but general motors and the steel industry did assert in the N brief they filed in that challenge to the N rule 
 well presumably duke could say we looked at the reich memorandum and we were following that and all of a sudden this new N official thing came up and they are surprised by that now you are saying its already too late because somebody else challenged it in N 
 well they might have that argument your honor except for the fact that the challenge to the N rules was stayed and was not reopened until N in N duke and other parties sought to reopen and were granted permission to reopen that challenge to the N rules they filed a statement of issues in N and a brief in N challenging the regulation on the ground that if epas interpretation was correct and that it did not require an increase in maximum total achievable emissions as the nsps did test did they argued that it was invalid they raised the very incorporation theory that they advance here that is the statutory argument that congress was required to follow for the psd regulations the same regulatory approach that the nsps regulations had followed in N with the hourly maximum achievable test they made that very argument in their brief in the dc circuit in N the dc circuit addressed and rejected that argument on the merits 
 to be fair to them that very same argument was more a product of the fourth official circuit than of duke they had a somewhat different approach before the fourth circuit and then the fourth circuit came up with this insistence on the parallel construction 
 yes well i think its important to distinguish there are two statutory arguments here one is what i would call the incorporation theory that is the argument that congress by borrowing the definition the statutory definition also necessarily borrowed and mandated adoption of the regulatory definition from the nsps program that argument the incorporation argument was made by duke in its brief in N in the dc circuit the dc circuit addressed and rejected that argument at pages N through N of its decision in its N new york decision 
 why was that rejection wrong because this issue is still important to me for purposes of statutory construction is it conceivable that when congress says the word widget in this statute has to mean the same as the word widget in the other statute that the agency can effectively frustrate the apparent congressional intent by saying oh yes i mean yes that has to mean the same thing but we can adopt regulations under one statute which regulations official say it means one thing and we can adopt regulations under another statute that says it means something else i mean to say that they have to mean the same thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to say they mean the same thing 
 your honor it is a fundamental principle of administrative law and deference to agency decisionmaking that when congress adopts an ambiguous statutory phrase and charges the agency with implementing that phrase the agency has discretion has a delegation of rulemaking authority and policymaking authority to choose from among the various permissible interpretations 
 of course it does but when congress says the definition in the two statutes has to be the same whatever choice the agency makes among those options has to be applied to both it seems to me 
 no your honor because congress has not mandated as it could have done that the choice of the specific interpretation from among the permissible options must be identical across both programs 
 well then its meaningless to say the definition has to be the same 
 no your honor official 
 entirely meaningless 
 the statutory definition is ambiguous but within the limits of the ambiguity it imposes constraints on the discretion of the agency the agency must choose from among the options that are permissible given the range of language that congress used but within that range the agency has discretion think of it this way your honor if there were no psd program if we were talking only about the nsps program congress gave an ambiguous definition to the agency the agency would have discretion to adopt different tests for determining whether emissions increased for different types of equipment even within that single program because the statutory definition is ambiguous the statute therefore does not mandate a one size fits all approach and the agency in its discretion could well determine that one emissions test is appropriate for some types of equipment another emissions test is appropriate for other types of equipment as long as both of those tests are within the permissible bounds of the statutory ambiguity the agency is entitled to do that 
 and the ambiguity is the word increase which could mean different things 
 yes your honor official 
 the government as i understand it now has a proposed regulation that would align the standards with the two programs it would bring the nonproliferation it would bring the standard for the nonproliferation program in line with the new source performance standard 
 yes your honor with respect to certain types of units electric generating units like those at issue in this case thats correct they would not be identical under the proposal but would be similar 
 well since the government is now taking the position that another duke could do just what was done here and theres an enforcement action pending would you if you prevailed in that enforcement action nonetheless enforce though its those against the current government policy 
 your honor the N proposal that you are referring to is only a proposal a notice of proposed rulemaking it has not been adopted so the rules as they exist today are the same as the ones we are talking about although there was a modification in N but in any event what we are talking about here is conduct that occurred from N through N with respect to official 
 well what exactly are you seeking in these enforcement proceedings an injunction to install the bact or criminal fines or civil fine or what 
 it is civil enforcement proceedings your honor there are various remedies injunctive relief and civil penalties where appropriate yes 
 if you have an enforcement proceeding and there is a legitimate question of whether or not the agencys interpretation is consistent with the statute with chevron deference and so forth and the court looks at it and says you know i have a real problem with the way the agency interpreted the basic statute when it first issued the regulation the court cant get into that merely because the parties didnt present it earlier 
 thats correct 
 the courts almost issuing an advisory opinion in a way 
 no your honor its not an advisory opinion the court is simply precluded from considering a challenge that would invalidate the regulation because that is the determination congress made in requiring preenforcement review to avoid the official problem of inconsistent determinations and circuit conflicts and N district judges potentially construing the statute in different ways and tying epas hands the congress made that determination 
 are there other areas in the law where courts have to take as binding a legal proposition that they think is dead wrong when they 
 its quite common its quite common your honor in any regime where review of an agency decision is relegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of one court as it is here and enforcement proceedings are brought in a different court hobbs act agencies their decisions are reviewable in the court of appeals but often enforceable in the district courts the district court cannot look behind the determination of the agency to challenge its validity because that rests in the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals obviously theres a timing issue in this statute as well because of the requirement of preenforcement review whatever whatever concerns might be raised in a situation where a party could not reasonably have been expected to challenge it at the time it was originally promulgated are addressed by the afterarising provision in section N which permits challenges that could not have been made within official the N day period to be brought later in appropriate circumstances and in any event if there were some concerns at the outer limits of a provision like this one they have nothing to do with this case where dukes challenge actual challenge to the agency decision the N rule it was heard in N and so duke had more opportunity than you could possibly ask for to understand exactly what epas position was understand exactly what the regulation meant and to challenge it in the dc circuit it did so and it cant do it here 
 mr hungar im curious what happens if you have a new company that wasnt around when the regulation was issued can it can it bring a challenge to the conformity of the regulation to the statute 
 well i think thats an unresolved question presumably the argument 
 well a nice question i mean all you have to do is find a stalking horse just have some new company carry your water for you 
 well presumably the argument would be that the creation of the company and the first applicability of the regulations to it is an afterarising ground i dont know the answer to that official question but certainly its not presented here 
 could it bring it up by a declaration of nonapplicability could the new company how would it 
 well it could seek a determination of nonapplicability but and it could obtain judicial review of that determination but that would not go to the dc circuit and would not permit a challenge to the regulations but they could find a petition they clearly could find a petition for rulemaking with the epa saying your regulation is invalid its been around for N years but its still invalid you need to rescind it and when the agency declined to do that they could then go to the dc circuit 
 in the midst of the enforcement action thats being brought against them by epa whats supposed to happen in the enforcement action if thats the vehicle through which epa is implementing its new interpretation 
 if this completely speculative and hypothetical situation were ever to arise a court might well exercise its equitable discretion to stay proceedings pending review in the dc circuit 
 can i ask you about an argument i think they did make i think they made this official argument on page N of your brief i think its explained well you set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase then you have little which is an exception and it excepts a physical change which leads to is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate so thats out of it now the question is whats in it if thats out of it whats in it i think what they have said is if you think about that we will tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity but just means you can run it more hours and they say their proof of that is that that was the epas interpretation for years and years and years indeed we did what we did thinking that was it and then after we did what we did they pulled the rug out from under us and said no that isnt it now it means any physical change like you change a nut or a bolt or a tube even though theres no increased capacity to emit more its just you run it more hours now that they say is basically unfair its not what this reg has been about and they made that argument according to them very strongly and the official fourth circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that its hard for even them to defend all right now thats what i think thats what i think is lying maybe thats lying at the heart of it and if it is what do you say 
 there are several things your honor first of all the language of the regulation simply does not support that interpretation what the regulation says is that hours of a change in hours of operation is not a physical change fine but we have a physical change here it is undisputed that duke made physical changes to its facilities major modifications sort of using that term in the nonregulatory sense but substantial replacements of physical equipment at the facilities so physical change has occurred the hours of operation exclusion therefore has no longer any relevance because it applies only at the physical change step of the analysis there has been a physical change here regardless of whether hours of operation changed or not therefore the hours of operation exclusion no longer applies the next question is whether the if the physical change that did occur resulted in a significant net emissions increase here it did under the plain official language of the regulations and under the test that epa applies it is true that N they were arguably mistaken to the extent one can discern what the mr reich was actually saying they seem to be simply a mistake in interpretation but in N the administrator of the agency the head of the agency made very clear epas position the very same position it is taking here today on the hours of operation exclusion the first circuit in the puerto rican cement case as your honor knows upheld that interpretation in N the seventh circuit in footnote N in the wepco decision upheld that determination in N it was restated by the epa again and again and it is well established thank you your honor 
 thank you mr hungar mr phillips 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court i think i am inclined instead of starting with the jurisdictional issue to focus initially on the regulatory history immediately in the wake of the N official rules because it seems to me it is very clear that the understanding of everyone in the industry outside the industry from N candidly well beyond N all the way up until N was that these regulations didnt apply under any circumstances in the absence of an increase in the capacity and you had to demonstrate that there would be an increase in the hourly rate of the emissions 
 then why were some companies asking for declarations of nonapplicability 
 to confirm precisely that interpretation thats exactly why ge went to mr reich and asked for a determination of applicability and was told categorically psd applicability is determined by evaluating any change in emissions rates caused by the conversion 
 but mr donahue said that there were nonapplicability applications after those early ones that came out the other way so there were companies 
 no well 
 who asked for a declaration of nonapplication and then epa took the position that it is currently taking 
 as i heard mr donahue he official was talking about wepco understand the context of wepco wepco was a situation where every one of the changes was a modification within the meaning of nsps and then the question is were they also modification major modifications within the within the meaning of the psd and thats what they analyzed so it didnt say anything about the argument we have been making which is what is a modification the only statements that i know of that are out there are the two reich statements which i just quoted to you says exactly our interpretation but even more powerful at least in my view is the quotation from the amicus brief from the state of alabama and the N states that relied on the region N statement and thats on pages N and N of that amicus brief and the answer the question is you know how do you determine what is a modification you know does something that doesnt increase the hours the emissions per hour constitute it it says no since the modification does not cause any increase in the hourly particulate emissions no increase in annual emissions should be calculated they could not have said that any more clearly than 
 who was saying that 
 that is the it is the chief of the air and waste management division james official wolburn giving guidance to region N region N is not only alabama it is also north carolina and south carolina and then in the wake of this right N north carolina and south carolina submit their sips and in their sips certainly the south carolina sip expressly incorporates the concept of modification north carolina a little less expressly incorporates the entirety of the regulatory scheme under title N under part N of the code of federal regulations 
 it looks like i went back and read the puerto rico cement case and it certainly looks as if though the issue was somewhat different it looks as if the interpretation that the epa is taking there is not consistent with what you are reading now and is consistent with what they are saying today and that was in N i guess they must have been starting on that in N so it seemed to me we have a mixed bag some people were saying the one thing some people were saying the other thing and the later in time seems to be the puerto rico cement and that was at least N years ago and 
 well justice breyer i think puerto rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem because what you are dealing with there is the elimination of two existing units the two kilns and a official replacement with a brandnew unit which would have been a modification under any i think under anybodys theory because there would have been an increase in the hourly emissions anyway so it would have been a nsps subject to the psd it didnt get analyzed that way but the truth is it would have been fully the way that decision came out would have been exactly consistent with the way that they analyzed it 
 the analysis which was probably pretty much based on what they said i think was that the reason there was increased potential here to pollute was really because this change would permit the plant to be run more intensively or more hours something like that 
 but that was based on the question of involving you know normal operations or nonnormal operations the court really didnt have to address and i dont think did address the question of how do you relate 
 no we didnt address it im not taking it as evidence of that im taking it as evidence that the epa then had a basic position similar to what they have now thats what im using it as a basis for thinking that they were not saying to have a change the official word change includes only a change in physical facilities that increases the amount of emission per hour am i right or 
 i dont think they were really arguing that particular point i mean thats not the way i would have read the argument that epa was making but and the bottom line is they didnt address this issue in wepco to the extent they came close to addressing this issue in wepco they lost it in the seventh circuit because wepco adopted an interpretation thats much closer to what we are asking for the answer given on the other side at this point that we should have we should have sought a determination well the problem with that of course is every one of these projects was being inspected the record is replete with examples from north carolina and south carolina and epa inspectors on site looking at every one of these projects 
 so then they will say your argument here even if you are right i think they think you are wrong but even if you are right they will say well thats an argument that it is arbitrary capricious abuse of discretion for them to change horses in the middle of the stream ie for them to take an interpretation of a reg that was longstanding and without official adequate notice and comment and so forth radically reverse that interpretation now thats not the issue in front of us now 
 but that is the issue in front of you i believe 
 because 
 because 
 they say because the fourth circuit didnt go really on that it went on some statutory thing and 
 to be sure but thats the opinion thats not the judgment the judgment of the court of appeals is that this enforcement 
 may i ask a question mr phillips focusing on this question in the amicus brief which the epa representative answered no supposing the epa had answered yes at that time would that have been a permissible answer within the meaning of the statute 
 if im not sure i understood the predicate of the question justice stevens which question are you asking 
 you know whats that page N and N of the of a source to modified have to have a significant increase in the soN elements official 
 oh i see 
 and they answered no you say they were right 
 right 
 im just asking want to know under the statute could they have answered yes and would that have been a permissible answer 
 no our position would be no that would have been an inappropriate under the rationale of justice scalia 
 so you are not basically relying on the fact that you were misled you are basically relying on the fact that they have interpreted the statute incorrectly 
 yes actually we are making both arguments our basic argument is that all along they have interpreted it in a certain way and then N years later they reversed course and that is arbitrary and capricious justice breyer and it is a basis on which to defend the judgment of the court of appeals 
 well is what the government is saying here is that suppose the regulation can be interpreted to say x or y x would hurt the company y would not is the government saying if it is official foreseeable that the agency might take the unfavorable position you then must challenge it in the dc circuit 
 i think thats exactly what they have to be arguing and it seems to me that that cannot be what N means justice kennedy you asked a great question should we have raised this in N N N when were we supposed to bring this up and the truth is in N we interpreted this statute the regulation exactly the same way epa did it would have been silly for us to raise that it is true that this issue comes up N years later in a bizarre proceeding but thats not what N is all about it says you are precluded from making a challenge in an enforcement action if the action of the administrator was subject to challenge well the action of the administrator was not subject to challenge in N and when we did have the subsequent rulemaking 
 just a pause under your view or the fourth circuits view if you read judge tatels opinion in new york versus epa he suggests suggests he says that epa adopted different interpretations of modification from the outset and so if what you are saying couldnt have been challenged official was the fourth circuits view that may not be accurate but if you are saying what couldnt have been anticipated was the argument you actually made to the fourth circuit that might be a different story 
 yes well i think that that is precisely what we are saying but you know judge tatel with all due respect to him is dead wrong because the interpretation of modification under nsps and under the regulatory psd was identical the regulations couldnt be any clearer in that regard because if you look at N a of our appendix you know the modification this is the nsps definition im sorry better go back a page N a N modification defines emission rate and the emission rate is expressed as kilogram per hour so that is absolutely clear that that is the nsps dobbs modification 
 thats the nsps section 
 thats the nsps section then you go two pages earlier to N a and you have the psd regulatory definition and it comes right back to emission rate or the regulatory history that says the emission rate as used in this provides is identical 
 they say that that provision only applies when there is no sip and thats official not this case 
 well in the first place it would apply in at least south carolina immediately because there is a sip that incorporates exactly the same language and second of all the notion that this regulation is inoperative on one side and fully operative on the other side make no sense it makes much more sense to recognize that modification is the trigger for construction which is in part N and that that incorporates this entire modification language 
 i dont understand that it seems to me each part has had different definitions and this definition only applies to part N which applies when there is no sip 
 okay 
 i dont know how you can say it automatically applies when there is a sip 
 the way that would apply 
 part N in other words 
 right go back to then you have to go back to N i think it is where we talk about the interpretation and we get to construction this is construction means a modification okay of an emissions unit so that and modification if it is undefined in title N right according to N official means whatever it means under the statute so that just takes you back to the statute and this is the interpretation under the statute the N interpretation is also an interpretation under the statute so it is completely circular and brings you right back to the same definition i agree by its terms it doesnt apply to N but going through the definitional provision in part N through the definition of the trigger for construction which is modification it takes you right back to the same meaning of the same provisions so there is no difference between the two and to me it is really critical and it seems to me there are sort of two points to make here one is nobody on the petitioners side of this case answers the state the dozen states who say we relied upon you when we adopted these sips we realized that you are asking us to take on enormous burdens and you should have told us that before we went down this path in the first place 
 mr phillips before you get away from this section N because i think that is the best section for your case N is there is there any sensible reason why you would want to have a different definition of modification for nonsip official situations than you would for sip situations 
 no absolutely not i mean you would you there is no rational 
 that occurred to me when 
 and i have not heard the other side make an argument that there is a rational distinction between the two and the truth is if epa wanted to achieve what it thought it was achieving that is to eliminate the concept of modification what it should have done is two things it should have it should have deleted N and it should have adopted the proposed regulation that it didnt adopt from the N regs this is on page N of their brief this statement is astonishing to me the term major modification serves as the definition of modification or modified when used in the act in reference to a major stationary source if they had adopted that regulation in N i wouldnt had to litigate this issue N years later we would have litigated this question in N because then we would have said thats flatly inconsistent with the statutory scheme because you are not entitled 
 you are quoting page N 
 page N of their reply brief 
 oh in their reply brief official 
 the sgs reply brief i apologize the gray brief where they seek to get some support for the idea that modification was dropped out of this analysis but the truth is that was a proposed rule that would have done exactly what they say that the N rule did without adopting that particular regulation 
 mr phillips can i ask another sort of basic question in your view would it be permissible for the agency to interpret the word to adopt a regulatory interpretation of the in the psd regulations of the word modification that was different from the definition it used under the new source regulations 
 substantively different 
 substantively different 
 no i think that would be impermissible 
 you think the statute required the regulation to be identical 
 yes i dont understand how its possible that congress says in the statute that you take the nsps trigger remember this is not just some random definition we are talking about construction is the trigger for this part of this entire regulatory scheme and modification is the trigger and say it is official as defined in and they did it twice 
 your answer is no 
 my answer is no 
 i thought i said that first 
 its definitely no 
 thats a no with some emphasis 
 would it have been permissible for the agency to adopt one definition for N years and then change the definition to the other definition for all programs 
 for all of it 
 yes 
 yes i think there is plenty of room within that 
 so either definition could comply with the statute 
 yes i think as long as you maintain consistency between the two there is a fair amount of discretion for 
 the obvious reason to do it is i guess you have an area of the country lets say which is quite clean in the air and there is a power official plant and what somebody works out which is normal is demand for electricity is increasing and so what we will do is we are going to take these turbines and system and we are going to change it really radically it doesnt produce one more particle per hour but now we can run it N hours a day and previously wed run it N hours a day so theres going to be twice as much pollution in the air now the whole idea of the psd system is you dont have twice as much pollution in the air and i guess thats why they wanted to do it 
 well i think the premise of that is the real question is if congress had meant that why would congress have adopted the same word modification as the construction trigger that existed in nsps 
 because you can use the same word you can apply the same word in different places differently depending on what your basic object is in the different place its very hard to say what kind of modification might exist over here there the other place and you put your finger on a very difficult question for power companies because those turbines do go at different amounts of rates and so forth during a day during a month during a year so its hard for them therefore you have a complex official definition whats wrong with that 
 because by the time the statute came up for review by congress and the psd program the new source review there was already a very extensive regulatory history about the meaning of the term modification 
 well i think whats wrong with it is that you could have achieved that same result by simply not saying that modification in one program has to mean the same as modification in the other if you didnt say that that would be the result you give modification whatever meaning you think is reasonable here you give it whatever reading you think is reasonable in the other place but when you say the two have to be the same it seems to me you have something else in mind 
 and it also seems to me justice breyer it clearly creates an obligation on the part of epa to be very explicit if its in fact going to do what you say its going to do you dont go about saying i am going to define modification in one statute fundamentally different from the way i define modification in another statute without discussing the word modification official and to put this in context you will remember these regulations were adopted in the wake of the alabama power decision alabama power didnt deal with the issue of modification that wasnt before the court nobody had challenged modifications definition the hourly emissions rate was a perfectly valid one what the court in alabama power said is you cant use this threshold for major modification and then the case so then the matter comes back and if epa immediately adopts a new set of regulations that deal what with what major modification not with modification and then they go through this entire elaborate analysis of major modification none of which candidly do we challenge we have no quarrel with their interpretation of the concept of major modification if anybody does my guess is the state environmental groups would 
 they make a kind of interesting argument major modification is not a subset of modification 
 yeah and if the solicitor and if epa had enacted the regulation that they proposed but didnt enact that says major modification means modification then we might have an argument there but the concept that when you have modification as a core official baseline construction i mean trigger for the applicability of this portion of the scheme and then you take that same and you not only do it once but you do it twice and you do it in the context of an entire regulatory scheme that was designed to implement this statutorily or implement this before the statute was enacted and you have congress saying well you didnt get that right but you did get this right and they leave this language exactly in the way it is the only fair inference you can draw from that it seems to me 
 why because the language i dont see anywhere in the statute where the words of modification are its a physical changing or change in a method of operation which increases the amount of any air pollutant now those words physical change which increases the amount of any air pollutant could mean different things in different places 
 sure 
 where does it say in the statute that they cant 
 where it says in the statute is where it makes this specific crossreference because if all they wanted to do was get that definition all they had to do was use the word modification they official didnt have to use modification as defined 
 mr phillips i want to be sure i understand your position are you saying the statutory text in effect says every regulation using the word modification must employ the same definition or are you relying on a general principle that when the same word is used it should be used in the same way 
 its a general principle that 
 so theres nothing in the statute itself that says that principle shall apply to this case 
 no but the general principle is that if the same language is used in two different portions you presume they have the same meaning when you go beyond that because otherwise their interpretation rendered superfluous the specific crossreferences to as defined in and as used in and while i know some dont like the legislative history the legislative history is quite clear that they had in mind and regulatory history as well 
 your answer is you are not relying simply on the general principle it is not just that they used the word modification in one place and the word modification in the other its that official in the latter place they said modification as defined in the first place 
 it depends on which general principle i suppose you are talking about im not relying on the mere presumption i think this is much stronger than the mere presumption 
 but your reference of modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the scope of the statutory meaning thats not the same as saying every regulation that is a modification must be the same no matter what the program 
 i think if you read it in context when you recognize that what congress was doing is adopting a statutory scheme that overlays on a regulatory scheme that was well established with very specific meanings and where congress quite clearly picked and chose i think thats the way to say it from the regulatory scheme and said we will take these and not take those and has a provision at the end N says all the regulations remain in effect until they get changed at some point suggesting 
 let me just be sure i understand the point if instead of saying as defined in x the second statute had merely quoted the same words that were in x would your argument be the same official 
 no it would not be nearly as strong as it is we would still have a presumption 
 so you are saying that if you used the definition as defined in another statute that implicitly says all regulations defining this term must be identical 
 i dont know if i have to go quite that far because i have more evidence than that in this particular case because i have the fact that they say as used in which suggests that its more than just a definitional point we do have a legislative history that seems to have in mind this regulatory background and we have been told by epa that when congress incorporated modification it really did incorporate that luggage baggage as well 
 this is very helpful to me because the government has accused you of abandoning the court of appeals approach to the case and i think you are endorsing the court of appeals 
 i do endorse it the only question i have i mean i dont think that it necessarily has to be that every word has to be identical in the two provisions but i do think they have to be congruent and so thats the strong version official of our argument and thats pretty close to where the fourth circuit was the weaker version of our argument which gets i think some mileage on the arbitrary and capricious part of the argument is at a minimum if congress adopts as the trigger point the same word in two statutes and epa then purports to be implementing that statute it has some obligation to explain how it is that they are doing a N with respect to the term modification and the reason 
 its not just a matter of using the same word 
 yes you are right 
 its a matter of a statute which says it shall have the same meaning 
 right they owe us some responsibility to explain how do you not follow that course 
 well could they have said that construction means both modification and then come up with a new word alteration because the statute says the term construction includes modification so i construction can be broader could it be an alteration they would come up with a new term of art and add that official 
 absolutely 
 to the psd 
 could they have gotten away with that i mean that would have been a much stronger argument it seems to me the better argument and but see the point here is if they had done that or if they had done what they proposed in N which is just to simply redefine major modification to be modification then we would have taken that issue directly to the dc circuit at that point in time 
 but you do have a brief here you have a brief filed in the dc circuit which is brief for industry petitioners on actual emissions definition 
 yes 
 and throughout that brief it refers again and again to the problem their proposed reg is not taking ie the potential capacity which is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or whatever but rather its using actual emissions even though you dont change the capacity of the machine theres a whole brief on that so you already argued that whole brief that what they were doing was inconsistent with the statute et cetera 
 the other side has not argued official collateral estoppel if thats the argument you are trying to make justice breyer 
 no as being outside the statute at that time and you did 
 well you have to put that into context we are talking about a matter that was closed for N years and then was reopened and this argument and it is true a variant of this argument was made i dont think its the full argument that we have made before this court and it was rejected by the dc circuit but if you are arguing that as a N argument my answer to that is this is still not action by the administrator that would trigger a N bar if you are asking about collateral estoppel my argument is 
 no i was just thinking then you are left with what you called the weak argument arbitrary capricious et cetera because i dont see how you make the stronger one what you think is stronger since you made it before or a version of it before the dc circuit 
 well again if you are arguing that as a matter of collateral estoppel then 
 no not collateral estoppel but you know id be repeating myself official 
 but if its not collateral estoppel and its not N then 
 thats what it is 
 so you are doing it as see i dont think it i think if you read N s language it talks about action of the administrator and what action of the administrator are we in fact challenging here nothing because in our view the N regulation quite clearly says what we want it to say the only thing thats changed is that the preambles have interpreted the N we challenged that and the dc circuit said no we are not going to address that issue thats an issue when you get back up when you get back on your enforcement action then you can complain about that aspect of it that issue is not ripe and that is exactly what we are trying to argue in this case and its a variant of what i think 
 mr phillips can i go back for a second to the meaning in includes the same meaning as in is it not correct under your view of the statute that that meaning can include either of the two definitions that the two regulations identify so that either whether you start with or the second statute either statute includes both may include both alternative regulations official 
 as long as they are consistent 
 yes 
 yes that is my position justice stevens 
 could you explain to me again why this isnt a N problem you said this is an action by the administrator 
 right because there is no action of the administrator that we would challenge the only action of the administrator was the N regulation which we interpret as not changing modification if you read N it clearly retains modification we have no quarrel then with what the administrator did in N then they adopt preambles to the subsequent regs we do challenge those but the dc circuit said we are not entitled to do that thats got to wait for an enforcement action the only thing thats left out there is this sort of inchoate interpretation by the administrator but theres no final action by the administrator for us to challenge then the only question would be do we have some obligation 
 you cant challenge in the dc circuit the administrators interpretation official that led to the enforcement action 
 i dont know how thats a final action the filing of a complaint as this court held in harrison is not a final action so that doesnt trigger it and i dont know what else is out there for us to serve as a hook i would think at a minimum the court would want to be very very loathe to jump on a expansive interpretation of N where it operates in a context like this as a pure gotcha you adopt regulations that nobody has a quarrel with you change the regulation afterwards and then you come back and you say you cant challenge it at this point that just cannot be a sensible interpretation of that statute if there are no further questions i would ask the court to affirm the fourth circuit thank you 
 thank you mr phillips mr donahue you have N minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice you just cant read the N regulations to achieve the result duke is seeking here there is no hourly rate in there and its important to note that these provisions that they now state misled them into official their nonchallenge they didnt even cite to the fourth circuit or the district court and on their face they are not its not plausible that these provisions which are totally nonspecific were intended to vary the very detailed and specific instructions on how to measure an emissions increase laid out and the preamble 
 well the one in part N surely does you have to give them that 
 no i dont give them that 
 you dont give them that 
 because it says rate and the N psc regulations say that the relevant rate is tons per year they use the word rate pervasively i would also say the preamble to the rule makes conclusively clear that major modification is epas definition of the statutory term this idea that epa its completely inconsistent with not only 
 major when you say the statutory term you mean modification 
 correct 
 so then why werent those proposed regulations saying just that adopted 
 i dont know the answer to that but its absolutely clear epa has never said official otherwise and of course the idea that an nsps modification is required first it would have been a big deal there is no sign of it and in fact there are specific examples the example cited at page N of the governments opening brief in the preamble is a psd major modification that would not be an nsps 
 thats a tough sell isnt it i mean the idea is you propose regulations saying major modification means modification those regulations are not adopted and then the industry is supposed to be on notice that thats still what you mean 
 i think that theres no other reading of what epa meant from the regulations no one was confused by this chief justice roberts no one was confused this argument its a new argument in this court about how to read the rules the N N N and N all uncited below its really not plausible the court would have to abandon a lot of very basic principles of how to interpret legal texts to read the rules this way and i think judge poisner was right on that he was right to say this is the natural reading of the rules 
 where is rate defined official im still troubled by N where is you say rate is defined where 
 rate is used as an annual rate in N and 
 its not defined you say its just used that way 
 its the only its tons per year consistently the other thing i would point out as the court is aware is that N applies it bars courts in enforcement actions which includes this court this case is not up on cert from the dc circuit in new york thank you very much 
 thank you mr donahue the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in case N powerex corporation versus reliant energy services mr frederick 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court in N the government of british columbia created powerex to perform a variety of public functions including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated by development of the provinces natural resources pursuant to bilateral agreements with the united states the ninth circuit however denied powerex its rightful status as an organ of a foreign state entitled to remove this case from state court to federal court before addressing the appellate jurisdiction issue id like to highlight briefly the two key errors by the ninth circuit in rejecting powerexs organ status first the court articulated the wrong test for determining an entitys status as an organ of a foreign state the factors the ninth circuit found dispositive are inconsistent with the fsia and second the court overlooked crucial evidence of powerexs public functions that are the best indication of its sovereign status the british columbia government receives and distributes the proceeds from powerexs operations supervises powerex through bc hydro subjects powerex to provincial laws not applicable to private companies and grants powerex special benefits including exemption from taxation 
 mr frederick are you going to get to the N problem 
 yes let me address that now the courts the district courts remand order was appealable because it was not issued under N 
 the district court thought it was and one we did the district court said i have no authority in under over any of these people so back it goes 
 the district court made two mutually exclusive statements that remand was proper and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because of that inconsistency the court of appeals 
 removal removal was 
 talking that where are these statements 
 you said remand was proper thats the 
 sorry that removal was proper under the sovereign removal provisions of N and N it also then said it lacked subject matter jurisdiction 
 but at the point it was acting it was remanding and its basis for remanding was not that it thought the removal had been proper the basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants 
 but immunity was the basis of the district courts thinking that it had to remand 
 it may have been leaving aside the question of whether it was right or wrong it may have been wrong but what it thought it was doing it seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a jurisdictional reason 
 and what this courts cases say justice souter is that the remand has to be a ground cognizable under N 
 those cases are all all based on thermtron you dont have any doubt that thermtron would come out the other way today do you 
 i certainly do 
 in light of in light of the statutory language as it exists now 
 mr chief justice the thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four times by this court notwithstanding two statutory amendments it has been reaffirmed and stare decisis on the basis of statute is the strongest form of stare decisis so i do 
 but stare decisis on the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the statutes been changed 
 mr chief justice the thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the osborn case has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead from the time it was decided even through statutory amendments our submission is that if congress intended to change that rule it could have done so clearly and we note that the respondents here dont ask for thermtron to be overruled and it is clear from the amicus on their side that the only way you could rule in favor of the respondents in this case would be to overrule thermtron 
 but thermtron was such a far cry from this case in thermtron the district judge said yes i have jurisdiction but im just too busy so im going to toss this case back to the state court 
 but here justice ginsburg the court did have jurisdiction because removal was properly effectuated once the entities that we moved were identified correctly as sovereigns either foreign sovereigns in the case of bc hydro or federal sovereigns in the case of bpa 
 but we go into that question all the time N is a nullity i mean if in every case you are going to be able to appeal whether indeed there was lack of jurisdiction you are going to be able to appeal every case 
 no you are not justice scalia and heres why immunity is not a ground for remand because it is not a precondition for a removal by a sovereign it is a separate freestanding issue it is a status determination that determines whether removal is proper by those sovereigns 
 that would be fine if N said that there is no appeal so long as the basis for removal was proper but thats not what it says 
 but if in thermtron the court the district court had said my docket is too busy i therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and remand under N i dont think theres any doubt that the courts would look beyond the label given 
 i dont think the court said in thermtron so therefore i have no subject matter jurisdiction 
 im speaking hypothetically justice ginsburg my point is that the label the district court attached here was the wrong label and thats why the court of appeals to satisfy 
 why why was it wrong when with respect to the sovereign parties the district court said i have these people are totally immune from suit therefore i have no jurisdiction over them 
 because it is inconsistent with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive effect to remand a case on the ground that the sovereigns are immune and force them to relitigate their immune status in state court that is precisely why congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions 
 then what you are really arguing for is in effect a separate rule and that is that N has an exception when we are dealing with foreign sovereign immunities 
 thats our backup submission justice souter you do not need to reach that if you agree with our principal submission and 
 but the trouble with the principal submission it seems to me is that we have said that even if the district court has come to an erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction if it understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling that is not appealable 
 but justice souter it did so the case the cases in which the court has said so have always been grounds jurisdictional grounds cognizable under N immunity from suit is not such a ground because the purpose of having the removal provision on the basis of status is to allow the federal courts to decide the immunity status if the court sends the case back to state court on immunity grounds it does not have preclusive effect in the state courts the state courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign immunity status and there will be no recourse except through appeal through the state court 
 well you are into your backup argument now 
 no 
 the backup argument that you are now making that not your principal argument 
 no justice scalia thats not our backup argument our point is that in this case the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of the successful removals which everybody conceded were correct that the label that it attached immunity is subject matter jurisdiction is not a label for a ground recognized in N so it was appropriate for the court of appeals to exercise appellate jurisdiction to determine whether or not the remand was a mandatory remand under N or a discretionary one of the type this court has recognized in the cohill case 
 did you request when the question of powerex authority over powerex was before the district court did you request that the district court give you a N order before the court remanded the case so that you could have gotten the case the question up on appeal 
 i dont believe that we did justice ginsburg this case was remanded a motion motions for clarification were subsequently brought but a N order was not requested by powerex 
 because that would have taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay the remand to allow this question of law to be determined by the court of appeals 
 it is certainly the case that in searching through the docket entries you will discover that there was a holding by the district court of the remand which is in itself an unusual procedure but the point that is important here is that even apart from that when the court had jurisdiction pursuant to the removal provisions it did not lose subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity claims upon the part of the federal and foreign sovereigns and it is their theory that the district court never had subject matter jurisdiction and that has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in federal court 
 they dont care whether it had subject matter jurisdiction or not its not an essential part of their case their case is even if it did it mistakenly thought it didnt and remand it end of case 
 their submission in this court however is that there was no subject matter jurisdiction 
 thats their backup argument i think 
 well their backup argument should be rejected by the court as wrong 
 if in fact it goes back to the state court and you litigate it you lost can you raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two things the statute guaranteed you one was a determination in the federal court that you are an organ of a federal state and second a bench trial 
 justice breyer theres no provision 
 no but could you 
 by the time the appeals in the state court would have been exhausted the very benefits 
 no im just asking could you yes or no i 
 we would certainly make the argument 
 yes okay now if you lost in the state court could you then use that as a basis for asking this court to accept jurisdiction and if they if we did we took it and we heard the case reverse and send it back for the proper tribal under the statute 
 justice breyer i would not want to foreclose any arguments that we might try to make but let me point out to you that in the years that it would take to march through the state court system powerex as a sovereign would be denied its right to have a bench trial 
 see what im getting at is whenever theres an erroneous remand the practical problems that you raise are present and they are awful i dont deny them i mean they are right there in the statute it foresees them so i wonder is there any difference in this case from every case where the remand is erroneous 
 i do think foreign sovereigns are different and congress intended to treat 
 in terms of the legal right to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your view of the law there is no difference 
 the foreign sovereign is entitled to a bench trial it is entitled to other procedural protections with respect to treatment of garnishment other 
 and you would get those eventually it would just have to happen 
 it would be after it would be 
 but thats purely pure question begging i mean the whole issue on the merits is whether its a foreign sovereign or not and you cant assume that you are correct when the remand provision or the provision barring appeal when its been remanded doesnt care whether you are correct the idea is you can get a correct determination in state court through up to review by this court eventually as you can in federal court theres no reason to assume that the federal court is the only place you would get a correct determination 
 but mr chief justice the point of having congress enact these removal provisions and to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for sovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to vindicate those rights and interests if powerex were sued for not 
 its its the same with diversity jurisdiction you can make the same argument theres nothing distinctive here this statute says that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a right to be tried in federal court fine but the statute also says that if you are a defendant in a diversity suit you have a right to trial in federal court and i dont know why this is any more demanding of an exception to N than is ordinary diversity jurisdiction where congress has said you are entitled to trial in federal court 
 diversity is different justice scalia and heres why when a case is removed on diversity grounds the court of appeals the district court is obliged to examine the bases of diversity that is what the courts removal duty is when a foreign sovereign removes a case the district courts duty is to determine is this a foreign state within the meaning of the fsia if it is i have jurisdiction 
 mr frederick may i just follow up on justice breyers question it seems to me that your answer suggests that you have two bites at the apple because you all the way along you might win and if you won then it wouldnt matter if you lose you always have the argument that you have made here lets go back and start over again 
 justice stevens i dont think we would win at all in that circumstance because we would be forced as a foreign state to litigate in state court contrary to congresss will 
 yes but 
 whatever arguments that may be preserved 
 but you might win that litigation its not impossible is it 
 it is certainly not impossible but the point 
 and if you lose you always have a point on appeal and may start all over again later on 
 it is unclear to me and im not sure that i have seen any of this courts cases that would suggest that the denial of that kind of procedural right would be grounds for reversing a state court judgment and our position is that congress intended to protect the bench trial right the immunity defenses of a foreign sovereign because the organ status questioned 
 did anybody in this case did any of the defendants in this case request a trial by jury 
 i dont recall whether the defendants do but it is clear that the plaintiffs would be entitled to a jury trial 
 and have they asked for it has any party asked for a jury trial if not that part of the case seems academic 
 well the case has settled justice ginsburg prior to the formal invocation of trial procedures and so 
 the case is settled 
 as explained in the cert petition papers the case is on appeal in the state court system on objections to the settlement and it will not be mooted during the course of this courts action on the case but the invocation of jury that would be done normally just before trial has not been an issue thats been presented 
 well thats different than it is in the federal courts you have to cant wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury 
 well what the plaintiffs here assert is that they would be denied their right to jury trial and i presume that that means they intend to ask for one and to perpetuate that request our position as we explain in a footnote in our reply brief is that they have a jury trial right as against duke and reliant they do not as against the foreign sovereigns that they have sued so at root the case is about the kind of comity and dignity that the courts of the united states will accord to foreign sovereigns if powerex were sued on the basis of noncommercial acts it would not be entitled to have its immunity defense vindicated if the district court is held to have no jurisdiction notwithstanding the proper removal under N id like to save the reminder of my time for rebuttal please 
 thank you mr frederick mr hallwarddriemeier 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this court has recognized repeatedly that the bar on appellate review in N applies only to remands under N this court has held that the courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a remand order was in fact one within the authority of N in fact just this term in osborn the district court remanded the case on the basis of N for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
 osborn made it very clear that was an extraordinary case where congress had explicitly ordered two conflicting things one it said no remand of a case of this type and then it said no review of remands so the court was as clear as it could be that only when you have those conflicting signals does that court does that case have any application 
 your honor is absolutely correct osborn concerned a particular kind of categorical exception from N our argument is that as a categorical matter the basis of remand in this case was not one within the scope of N that although the district court termed the sovereign immunity of the defendants jurisdictional it was not jurisdictional in the relevant sense and this court held precisely that in the oliver american trading case there a case removed by mexico was dismissed by the district court on the basis of its immunity and the district court certified that holding as a jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this court yet this court looked beyond that label attached by the district court and held that sovereign immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense because it does not limit the authority of the federal courts qua federal courts but rather is a general rule that would preclude suit in state court as well likewise under N it is not a basis to remand that the defendant is immune when congress authorized sovereign defendants to remove cases to federal court to vindicate their immunity it did not intend that when the district court upheld that immunity it would be remanded to state court which would be free to disregard the federal courts decision 
 one technical question the same one i would to be imagine it is a diversity case imagine that a federal court erroneously remands it a trial gets up to this court and we say it was diverse it shouldnt have been remanded now whats is that like can that happen i guess and is the remedy then wipe out the state proceedings go back to federal court what happens has that have ever been a case like that 
 yes 
 what happened 
 the missouri pacific railway case holds that even this court on review of a state court judgment following remand cannot review the remand order itself it can review issues of federal law that were decided by the state courts on remand but 
 and it is called the case missouri 
 missouri pacific railway case 
 counsel what what do you do about N which says that if after removal joinder might defeat subject matter jurisdiction the court can deny joinder or permit joinder and remand the action in other words you have got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute contemplates it may later later you may lose subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there and i suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari materia with so that the remands would not be subject to review it seems to me the same situation here you have got allegedly subject matter jurisdiction it is later defeated and it is remanded why shouldnt that be covered by 
 what whats notable is that congress enacted N at the same time that it amended N it provided in N for an authority to remand in a particular instance where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction postremoval it had of course been the rule since this courts decision in st paul mercury indemnity that postremoval events did not defeat the removal courts jurisdiction and in the statute it was made explicit that N authorized remand only when the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction and when congress amended the language in N to make clear that nonjurisdictional defects in removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited it at the same time and added the language or changed the language in the second sentence that raises problems for our argument at the same time it added N to provide as i said a particular authority to remand based on postremoval events that would have been unnecessary if as respondents urge N was intended to confer general authority to remand on the basis of postremoval events 
 but you dont have any doubt that a remand under N would be covered by N do you 
 no and the courts of appeals that have considered that question likewise hold that a remand under N is right in pari materia with although the courts seem to be split on whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable decision appealable under waco or not but but that issue is not presented but what is significant is that had congress intended by the amendment of N to authorize for the first time remand on the basis of postremoval events N would have been unnecessary and yet the legislative history the N makes clear that congress believed that in the absence of that provision the court would have been limited to two alternatives authorize the joinder or deny the joinder or dismiss the case 
 how is that relevant here where is the postremoval event 
 the postremoval event here is the recognition of the defendants sovereign immunity 
 well thats not an event thats thats an epiphany its not an event 
 well according well apparently the district court viewed it as a postremoval event that deprived it or defeated divested 
 very strange meaning of event 
 well i your honor 
 i mean the sovereign immunity didnt exist from the outset nothing changed 
 but but the district courts order is clear and it is absolutely correct in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed at the outset so the court does not lack removal jurisdiction the reference in N second sentence to lacks subject matter jurisdiction refers to lacks removal jurisdiction and in fact this court used that shorthand repeatedly in the kircher decision to describe N lacks removal jurisdiction this court 
 when did it say that i really find it very hard to accept that argument when its says you know it doesnt use lacks removal jurisdiction thats what it means it is such an easy thing to say 
 well the court has to go back to the history of the statute how its evolved clearly preN authority to remand was only if it was removed without jurisdiction and so the question is when congress changed the language to lacks subject matter jurisdiction did it mean lacks removal jurisdiction which it 
 under the under the district courts view would there have been original jurisdiction against powerex 
 no it would not have bit thats because of the peculiarities of the difference between original jurisdiction under the fsia section N and removal jurisdiction under the fsia whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a conclusion that the defendant is not immune congress conferred removal jurisdiction whenever a foreign sovereign is defended 
 then can you 
 likewise in N which was about the federal 
 can can you tell me if the petitioner does not prevail here the case goes back to the state court can the immunity argument be raised in the state court 
 the immunity argument could be raised in state court thats what this court held in kircher but the defendant would be forever denied its right to a bench trial under federal law that right is limited to suits in the federal courts by its term N 
 in other words the state court couldnt say well you know this district court was wrong theres really immunity under the federal statute the state court cant hold that 
 the state 
 because then youd have constant eternal shuttling back and forth thats why 
 the state court could reconsider powerexs status as a foreign sovereign but it wouldnt have many if any implications in the state court because powerex isnt claiming immunity in this case its only invoking the procedural benefits of the fsia which include that the case be litigated in the federal court before a judge rather than a jury and it would be forever denied the benefits those important procedural benefits of the statute if this court doesnt uphold review of the 
 well we dont know 
 in other words the the federal determination bars the state court from redetermining that theres immunity that the state court cant say federal court you are wrong 
 the issue of immunity of powerex was never raised in this case it can review the question of whether it is an organ of the state it but it cannot review the remand determination that powerex can never be granted the procedures benefits of federal foreign order bench trial thanks your honor the court thank you counsel mr simon 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court there are two reasons independent and sufficient reasons why there is in appellate jurisdiction in this case the first most narrow and simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of jurisdiction is to follow this courts precedents which accept the district courts remand order for what it is and what it says it is a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under N unremovable under N that is a simple direct route to that result there is a second approach suggested by a lot of the briefing and some of the argument your honors have heard this morning and i want to lay it out briefly for the court and it is that as the law professor amici have suggested there is some amount of confusion in the lower courts i might say with due respect evasion of N in the lower courts by judgemade exceptions to N created by some but not all of the courts of appeal and the court could clear out some of this underbrush mooting many of the issues that mr frederick and the that solicitor general have raised thermtron after carnegie mellon addressing the question justice kennedy raised in his concurring opinion in things remembered versus petrarca thermtron does not say what many of the lower courts think it does thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it does because thermtron has been partially overruled by carnegie mellon the notion that the only proper remand is a N remand is ancient history after carnegie mellon and therefore the notion that the only remand covered by N is a remand under N is also ancient history congress has given us a simple and strong message which is when we are disputing the forum when the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith disputing forum state court versus federal court congress has said take one shot at it let an article iii judge determine whether the forum is state court or federal court and move on to the merits 
 well what what reason would congress have for wanting a system that says and there are many many many people in the united states who would like to sue pakistan they would like to sue china they would like to sue russia there are all kinds of places they would like to sue and why would congress want to have a system that says to those countries you can come into federal court and get your claim adjudicated whether it is really you china a but by the way if the federal judge makes a mistake there you are in mississippi alabama illinois any one of N different states in front of juries the very thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldnt have to do now what would their theory be 
 it 
 can i im not sure it is even that he made a mistake it is even worse than that if he gets it right and finds that you are a sovereign 
 let me try to answer it 
 you can go back to state court i mean thats even worse he gets it right 
 let me try to answer both questions the problem is whether he gets it right or wrong we spend two years in a court of appeals but your honor you are assuming theres an immunity issue in this case with due respect my adversaries are arguing someone elses case there is no immunity claim in this case by powerex there is one petition one petitioner 
 they were saying they were an organ of 
 they were saying they were an organ 
 yeah and therefore they are immune unless unless they fall within an exception and it may be they do is that not right 
 no they conceded that they fell within the exception 
 well im saying thats how the statute works 
 right 
 but i take it if you win this its precisely the same in respect to a person who has total immunity 
 no 
 why not 
 i would disagree your honor 
 why not 
 a party who has total immunity 
 yeah 
 would have removed the case the same way 
 yeah yeah 
 and it would have presented two arguments to the district court it would have argued number one we are a foreign sovereign maybe it wins maybe it loses and number two we are immune 
 yes 
 there is a solid line of cases that suggests the decision on immunity first of all let me say i think it is somewhat farfetched that a party that would actually be immune say the king of saudi arabia would end up being in this third lowest category of foreign purported foreign sovereigns and end up in the position powerex is in but if it did in other words we have three categories we have immunes we have nonimmunes who got federal court and then we have wouldbe foreign sovereigns like powerex who end up in state court and im suggesting for a party to fall from the first category to the third in front of an article iii judge 
 and a judge makes a big mistake 
 makes a big mistake 
 china comes in 
 right 
 and says of course you are china and then it signs a remand order 
 i would submit your honor the question has never been addressed by this court the lower courts suggest that that is a collateral order the immunity issue not the remand issue we actually now have a waco type case 
 no well after all if you are going to say you say that one is reviewable on appeal 
 the immunity 
 is it or not in your view 
 in my view the immunity issue but not the remand is reviewable on appeal 
 fine and now all they want here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal 
 right and the difference is 
 and whats the difference between the one and the other 
 the difference is that the immunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a line of court of appeal cases a majority not a unanimous majority never blessed by this court which suggests that immunity is so important dont need a lawyer you dont go to court you dont say a word you dont spend a dollar you walk away so important that you are entitled to an immediate 
 okay and you agree with that 
 and i agree with that 
 fine then why is it in your opinion that the immunity thing is so important that they get this collateral appeal but the organ thing is not so important since all what turns on that is whether they are going to have their nonjury trial 
 well i want to come back nonjury trial and answer justice ginsburgs question because i dont think she got the right answer but the reason its more important is this is as justice scalia said like a diversity decision this is a litigation who sells power in the pacific northwest and admits that it competes with enron duke and reliance and it is disputing whether it belongs in a state court in san diego or the federal court across the street in san diego leaving aside the jury issue and that is precisely the kind of dispute that congress suggested in N and its predecessors which have been on the books for more than N years ought to be done once what do they say one and done is that what they say in the district court 
 you are saying this all turns on our assessment of the strength of the interest in remaining in federal court is that what it boils down to 
 no it turns on the strength of getting an immediate decision on the immunity question the immunity question i think is a question of an entirely different nature than the question of forum in the 
 the immunity question the immunity question is the same as state or federal court because the statute as its written any foreign sovereign china whatever is as immune from state court jurisdiction as it is from federal court jurisdiction because congress said so but with respect to the commercial enterprise congress said we are going to give you a federal court and we are going to give you a judge trial that doesnt apply to state courts 
 thats correct but congress said we are going to give you a federal forum and a bench tribal if you convince us that you are an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state this this corporation powerex failed to make that convincing showing having failed to make that convincing slowing again they are debating in the appellate courts and tying litigants up for two five years over whether this case should be litigated in state court or in federal court 
 there was a sovereign party who said im out of this i have suit immunity and that was the bc 
 bc hydro 
 what happened to bc hydro because as i understand the district court sent that party back too 
 the district court found that they were immune properly followed the law but determined because it believed it had no subject matter jurisdiction that it should then stop at that point that it should just walk away from the case and remand it over the vehement disagreement of bc hydro and the parallel vehement disagreement of the bonneville power administration the ninth circuit when it erroneously took the appeal on the remand also clarified or straightened out that issue 
 yes but it couldnt if you are right then the ninth circuit never should have touched this case so what happens to the three parties two us parties one british columbia who are entitled to suit immunity 
 well whats happened so far is nothing which might tell us that in the practical world when a federal district judge says that bc hydro is immune and then remands a multiplaintiff multidefendant multicross defendantcross defendant case to san diego superior court it is exceedingly that the san diego superior court will reconsider the immunity but if it did 
 but could it 
 i suppose it could but if it did that matter is subject to appeal and subject to ultimate certiorari review in this court so i think we are talking about a frolic 
 i thought the argument you were making a few minutes ago if i understood it correctly was that bc hydro would not have been barred by N from taking an appeal to contest the remand is that correct or not 
 i think bc hydro could have taken a collateral order a collateral order appeal 
 whether its a collateral order or not just goes to whether it falls under N it doesnt speak at all to the issue of N 
 bc hydro could have attempted to appeal the immunity decision under a series of decisions which suggest that immunity is so important that it ought to be decided right then 
 the difference between that immunity and powerexs status is what its simply the fact that theres a stronger interest in allowing immediate appellate review federal appellate review of the determination of the remand of a party that claims to be a sovereign as opposed to powerexs status as an organ 
 among several other things there is a stronger interest in that and we are not debating about the forum again we have the kircher case from last term saying state courts are perfectly capable of resolving this issue that is a quotation actually from the missouri pacific case 
 if we think that powerex that theres a strong interest in having powerex remain in federal court if its entitled to that under the foreign sovereign immunities act that would be suffer to get around N 
 i think justice scalia was correct to say there is just as strong an interest in a diversity case in having a new york corporation trying to escape 
 but im having im having the same problem as justice scalia and justice breyer can you say in just a few sentences the difference between the case where there is sovereign immunity china the china hypothetical and this case where its organ immunity 
 yes if i could 
 you are telling us that one is more important than the other but theres no textual basis in the statute for us to make that distinction 
 i think there are two differences so if i could one is textual and one is important let me start with the textual difference the textual difference is that N speaks to remands and so to the extent the district court remanded the matter to state court the remand is untouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of N and if the foreign if the foreign relations body lobby doesnt like that if the state department doesnt like that they can go to the capitol and get that fixed quite easily there are half a dozen exceptions to N for class actions for native americans for civil rights cases and they can get their own exceptions so to the extent what the trial court did was remand it is untouchable that is my textual answer its a remand ie waco in which the court says the remand is untouchable the dismissal of the unnecessary or indispensable party is reviewable so what i would say is although the remand is untouchable the denial of immunity and thats why i kept saying collateral order i apologize if that confused you justice alito i meant that line of cases about going straight up even though the case was continuing while the case continues in state court where it belongs under N it would appear under this line of collateral order cases that the denial of immunity per se could go up on its own 
 im asking why is denial of immunity for sovereign status different from denial of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial etcetera 
 possibly possibly this could would decide that question the other way but 
 we have this very old judge like me china is there and he says this isnt china formosa is china so he says remand so there we are china is now in the western district state court for illinois and they are suing them for a lot of money now you said i thought before that where that happened and they wrongly ly denied immunity they could china appeal in the federal system i thought you said that 
 yes 
 all right 
 but not the remand 
 what 
 but not the remand 
 all they want is a definitive appeal that this is really china all right now can they do that yes or no you said yes so i thought justice kennedys question was if they can do that why cant powerex appeal in exactly the same way on the question of whether they are an organ whats the difference 
 the first difference is what i said in response to your honors question was i think they could do that under some cases from the courts of appeal i know they cant appeal the remand because we have an act of congress which 
 i dont care i dont call this an appeal of a remand what this is it is an appeal of the determination precedent to remand that powerex is not an organ 
 well justice breyer 
 that would make them just as happy i believe 
 justice breyer think about a multiparty case and maybe my answer will be clearer to you in a multiparty case my position is the remand stands the case goes back to missouri or mississippi or wherever your hypothetical was but at the same time i do believe that the potentially immune party which is not here in this courtroom today the potentially immune party could seek to review of what is a dispositive ruling remember thats a dispositive ruling they win the case thats very different than a venue ruling 
 regardless of how they would get up on it assuming they could get up on the immunity question our series of questions is why do we draw or why should we draw a distinction between immunity and federal bench trial and your answer is i take it immunity is dispositive federal bench tribal is not 
 immunity is dispositive and federal bench trial is not and is no different from the day to day decisions district courts make all the time about the choice between a state court and a federal court in the area of remands and removals 
 immunity suit immunity is you cant be sued anyplace not in state court not in federal court you cant be sued period but now it is admitted that you can be sued thats not in dispute in this case right 
 thats correct 
 so the only question is where 
 and that is my core 
 the question is if 
 excuse me that is my core point that congress told us when the only question is where we stop after one level and we move on to the merits 
 can you help me with 
 i would like to answer your question about a jury but i think i interrupted justice stevens 
 i just want to be sure your position assume that there is a remand that was improper and cannot be appealed under your theory and the powerex argues all along i was entitled to a federal forum and a nonjury trial and the state court says no all the way up can they file a petition for certiorari saying we had a federal right that was denied us not the remand but our entitlement to a bench trial can they petition for certiorari at the end of the state proceeding in your view 
 other than the jury question i think the answer would be no because of N because i think N would suggest that thats an appeal of a remand but again you are asking questions that i believe have not been addressed by this court or even lower courts 
 im just wondering what your position is 
 a clever enough lawyer i suppose could argue that at that point that we are no longer challenging the remand the remand has happened and been completed and the trial has taken place we are now simply challenging the results and maybe that clever lawyer would win the day 
 and in effect he would say i mean i assume what the clever lawyer would say is state court cannot try me at all the feds can do what they want about remand and it gets back here but because im entitled to a bench trial you cannot try me at all isnt that the argument 
 oh i think in state court a clever litigant could argue all these points over again because N 
 but his clever opponent would say 
 that what N means is that you can be tried in state courts thats precisely what it says 
 and ultimately when the two clever parties got to the state supreme court they would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if we granted cert this court would decide it wouldnt it 
 this court would ultimately decide it and they would ultimately decide questions such as whether the jury or to put it the other the bench trial issue has been preserved 
 why not say depending on the clever lawyers or nonclever as the case may be why not just say congress intended that you do get an underlying appeal in the federal system for what is at stake is not simply where the case will be tried but rather significant and important rights attach in the federal court that do not attach in the state court and therefore it is right the appeal you get when they when what is at stake is immune or not and by doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and the necessity to hire clever lawyers 
 well congress has said congress has said the contrary and there are often important differences between state and federal courts justice breyer i think you have some experience in california we have N to N jury verdicts you will have a litigant here next year saying that the difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous jury verdict or a N to N jury verdict and thats really important now i would just briefly like to go back to justice ginsburgs question about a jury because i dont think she got the full answer let me give it to you justice ginsburg the jury issue is virtually i would say not virtually the jury issue is out of this case based on my adversarys reply brief i will tell why you we did ask for a jury trial in our case and we were upset about the whole notion of this case being removed on a crossclaim we were not involved in we never sued powerex losing our right to a jury trial on this important case mr fredericks reply brief says at footnote N page N or footnote N page N i apologize that our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that under certain lower court decisions which he is correct they do exist im not sure they are unanimous our right to jury trial would survive even though he would have a right to a bench trial under his theory well there is no right to a jury trial on the cross claim against mr fredericks client the cross claim in the california court which got this whole ball of wax rolling is a cross claim for equitable indemnification and declaratory relief equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury trial so i think we are all now in agreement on a jury trial we are arguing someone elses case some day a litigant will appear in this court and present the issue of jury trial 
 but they raise that there is still the question of federal forum over state forum 
 there is and thats the issue that i think congress has clearly and definitively said the state courts have pretty good judges pretty good juries pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to this court in kircher the courts opinion says the state courts are perfectly competent to resolve these issues the cost of this case being frozen for N or N years while we debated these issues and these issues are very difficult i would say we dont only have a backup position we have a backup backup position because we think number one the court should be taken at its word we think number two the court had no subject matter jurisdiction removing jurisdiction is not subject matter jurisdiction if you look at the book chapter N section N et cetera its titled removal of cases from state courts you wont find the word subject matter jurisdiction in there anywhere a removal petition removes a case from the state court to the federal court where if its a foreign sovereign immunities case the federal court decides if it has subject matter jurisdiction thats what N says in haec verba its what this courts decision in verlinden versus central bank of nigeria says in haec verba verlinden says every court that gets a foreign sovereign immunities case must determine at the outset whether it has subject matter jurisdiction by determining if the foreign sovereign is immune which means that judge whaley was correct when he decided that by concluding he had an immune party in front of him he had no jurisdiction and it was equally correct for bonneville when he determined that united states versus myers says the same thing so that he had no subject matter jurisdiction and in addition there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine this notion of removal jurisdiction quote unquote its a term we all use the court used it in kircher i use it other people use it but if you start getting serious about your words its meaningless in this context we have subject matter jurisdiction and it is conferred in the area of N N N it is not conferred in N N or N its simply not there so my backup argument is he was right on every point and my backup argument beyond that is again please reread carnegie mellon put it next to thermtron and look at what the lower courts have done they have found excuse after excuse to take appeals in cases that have no business being in the courts of appeals they dont have immunity issues they dont have foreign sovereign issues they dont have anything 
 well the reason why they may have done that is because they have seen case after case where absolute power corrupts absolutely and because district judges know that remand orders are not reviewable on occasion they will remand cases for reasons that are clearly improper that may be the reason now on your first argument you say that what the district judge says is dispositive you mean if the district judge says i lack subject matter jurisdiction because my docket is crowded thats not 
 no 
 thats not 
 no your honor i overstated let me say it more clearly kircher decided last term makes clear the line between what can and cant be done it discusses precisely this point and it refers to the ryan versus contra case and it refers to the principi case and it says that when the court is patently wrong about whether the issue it is discussing is subject matter jurisdiction then this court may enter into 
 counsel its a good thing you have got a lot of fallback arguments because you fall back very quickly i would have thought your answer to justice alito would be the statute says if its remanded its not reviewable on appeal or otherwise and if its remanded for a silly reason that will be corrected on review of the state supreme court by this court 
 that would be my first answer and the chief justice said it much better than mine than i have but i think your honor looking at kircher to be fair looking at kircher i believe that is the position justice scalia took it is concurring opinion and i didnt want to suggest that justice scalias concurring opinion was the opinion of the court the opinion of the court wrestles with what i thought was justice alitos question what do you do if the trial judge says he has no subject matter jurisdiction and he has not simply made a garden variety jurisdictional error but he has missed what the issue is its really failure to state a claim its really something else and we of course have the steele case which says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often get confused about them and the court answered the question by saying only when the trial court is patently wrong patently wrong not about the jurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a jurisdictional question only when the court is patently wrong do we second guess the court so 
 that certainly changes the argument so the notice of appeal thats filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court wrong it was patently wrong and the court of appeals has to consider that before determining whether it has jurisdiction to review the remand order 
 if the court wants to adopt justice scalias view in the prior case in the kircher case my clients would be pleased with the results 
 i recommend that 
 but i think justice roberts i think mr chief justice i apologize because my time is running short i would say the key point in this case came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in the ninth circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing and argument and it was denied that was the point at which if a litigant simply parroted the phrase this is patently wrong would likely in most circuits before most panels have lost and this matter would have gone back to the state court N or N years before it got affirmed by the ninth circuit and five years before today unless the court has any further questions i think i have completed my comments 
 thank you mr simon mr frederick you have three minutes remaining 
 mr chief justice a nonjury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity this courts cases have recognized that in footnote N of the governments brief the government cites the lehman case which makes this point clear and argues that the point should be applicable to sovereigns in the context in which we are faced here the question of whether a foreign entity and its more complicated often in the real world justice breyer as your questions identified not simply with questions but with the kinds of entities that foreign governments create to advance public purposes the intent of congress was not to have those kinds of entities tested in state court to determine whether or not they enjoyed the privileges and procedural protections of the fsia and it is not simply a question of whether or not an elderly judge might choose to recognize china or formosa but rather the kinds of instrumentalities that were created by those governments to advance public purposes to serve as separate political entities and who would be performing the kinds of acts that might lead them into litigation and 
 and congress said those entities dont get any immunity they get two things they get a federal forum and they get a judge trial thats all thats at stake 
 thats not all thats at stake justice ginsburg there are also rights with respect to foreign states to be free of punitive damages there are rights to have certain property of the sovereign that would be subject to different attachment rules the fsia has a whole string of procedural protections that are afforded to foreign states and their instrumentalities and this case ultimately is about the fact that powerex is being subjected to multiple suits in state court but as a result of the ninth circuits holding in 
 are those have they been sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or have they always been brought in by defendants 
 they have been directly sued by the people of the state of california whom my brother here represents they have been sued by the california attorney general they have been sued by the california department of water resources and under the ninth circuits precedent in this case which i urge you to overturn powerex has been remanded to state court has not been permitted to appeal the remand order and is stuck in state court in these cases without any opportunity to test what is a clearly erroneous and what my brother doesnt make any attempt to defend the merits of the decision that powerex has performed public functions its serving at the direction of the government of british columbia and is performing these functions to advance clearly public purposes and yet we are now in this kafkaesque work world between state and federal court where if we try to litigate all the way up through state court it is not entirely clear whether we will ever have our organ our status as a foreign organ ever vindicated thank you 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in hill v mcdonough mr doss 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in nelson v campbell this court held that a challenge to procedures to execute an inmate may be brought in a section N action unless the challenge would necessarily prevent the state from carrying out its execution mr hill does not challenge the states right to execute him by lethal injection but instead only challenges the particular protocol florida department of corrections in their discretion has adopted mr hills claim thus does not necessarily prevent his execution and his claim falls squarely within the scope of nelson as announced by this court the current claim the only focus of that claim is the discretionary choice of the particular injection procedure that has been chosen by the florida department of corrections therefore it does not violate nelson because the relief sought would not necessarily prevent the state of florida from carrying out its execution the state could still carry out the execution through a more humane means by altering the particular protocol that that they have adopted 
 which you decline to specify right 
 im sorry justice i didnt hear the first part of your question 
 by a means which you decline to specify so that if they come up with some other means you could you could object to that as well i assume 
 well there in in answer to your question theres never been a a requirement that a section N plaintiff must plead a constitutionally acceptable alternative 
 no i understand that but im just im just pointing out what what becomes available to you if we if we give you the relief you request 
 well this 
 you we we say this this procedure is no good the state comes up with another procedure and you challenge that one right and and another few years go by 
 i i respectfully disagree with the fact that it would just leave open a total series of challenges 
 why 
 the state the state would have the opportunity to come in and propose a acceptable alternative just like any other finding of unconstitutionality once they propose that alternative we can challenge that if something is is not acceptable or accept the the proposed alternative and the court enters a a consent decree 
 you you think that the the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial court finds that this is no good and and then the trial court proposes an alternative or or invites the state to propose to the trial court an alternative and then asks whether you agree to that alternative and if you dont the trial court makes the decision whether the alternative is is constitutional or not 
 this thats 
 thats not bad 
 thats entirely correct and i think we have seen that in in a couple of the cases that are out there mr browns case out of north carolina followed that track mr morales case somewhat followed that track although through no fault of mr morales california wasnt able to carry through on the alternative that they chose because the anesthesiologists decided to not participate but it but it just proceeded to basically an up or down ruling upon the proposed alternatives so i i would disagree that theres a seriatim effect of of just perpetual litigation over whether the alternatives 
 you are envisioning that one case will take care of it that is if the court rules against you thats the end of it you cant come back with another inadequacy because youd be barred by claim preclusion on the other hand if the state comes up with an acceptable alternative you agree to it thats one thing the court holds but there wouldnt be a second episode i think one way or another this proceeding would end it 
 the only the only way i would foresee a second episode is if they if they proposed a second unconstitutional procedure 
 well that probably will be what will be alleged of course you dont know when at this proceeding we have no idea if we rule in your favor what alternative the state is going to provide and i am willing to bet whatever that alternative is that it will be subject to a challenge under a new N suit there would be no claim preclusion if you didnt know what the alternative was at this point right 
 thats correct although it would proceed to basically an up or down ruling just as it did in in the brown case and the the morales case 
 in this very case you are saying the court would would rule on the states proposed alternative right 
 thats correct 
 but if you disagreed with that you could appeal it up again right you can go to the court of appeals 
 thats correct 
 and then seek cert up here right 
 that that would be correct 
 may just as a maybe this is technical but what did you ask for for relief did you ask for relief that the state be enjoined from using this method or that the state be enjoined from executing him until an acceptable method had been found because in the first case the door theoretically is open to seriatim N actions and in the second case presumably the issue would be resolved in this one case as you suggest so which did you ask for injunction against this or injunction until an acceptable alternative came up 
 we asked for for two two injunctions one a preliminary injunction allowing the the court to be able to consider the case and then the way the prayer for relief was worded is is that we asked for a permanent injunction barring the state of florida from executing mr hill as they currently intend 
 well if thats if thats the relief you get then the door would be open to successive different N actions every time the state comes up with with a new protocol whereas if what the if if the trial court if you succeed at this stage if we say yes you are you are properly in court and you go ahead and litigate it if the trial court in fact awards not the injunction that you asked for but the injunction saying do not execute this person until a constitutional protocol has been proposed and accepted by the court then everything will get resolved in this one action as you suggest so would would you consent to as it were to an amendment of your prayer for relief so that the injunction will be in such a form that everything can get resolved in this one case 
 in in the sense of of the state of florida proposing a a hopefully a constitutional way of executing 
 yes 
 mr hill where it wouldnt give rise to another N action 
 right 
 yes 
 you you would agree to that 
 yes 
 well do you have confidence 
 you said 
 do you have confidence that florida can do that 
 based upon the litigation that we have seen around the country yes i think there are acceptable ways to to do it out there whether they would choose that way or not i dont know because the way floridas system is designed is is that its not statutorily mandated as to as to particular protocol thats utilized its left totally with the secretary of the florida department of corrections its not subject to any rulemaking or any administrative procedures as far as promulgating those rules its its just within the secretarys discretion 
 do you 
 well one one of the circumstances that that was raised by the questioning is this states generally have the defense of laches they they require the petition to be filed within a reasonable time with changes in pharmacology the laches defense will not usually be available and under the proposal that the the state resolves it once and for all i suppose the state couldnt adopt a new protocol that it thought was better more humane without risking more litigation so it it really is a disincentive for the states to try to make the procedure less painful for the for the accused 
 well within within the eighth amendment jurisprudence of of the evolution of of eighth amendment jurisprudence we have seen hanging go by the wayside we have effectively seen electrocution go by the wayside as we advance as a society and as we advance within our knowledge of whats going on 
 precisely and thats going to be true with every new protocol 
 thats an thats an evolution over time its 
 you said there were other states you mentioned california there was a proposal by the state it couldnt be executed what was the experience you mentioned a couple of other cases where the particular combination of drugs was successfully challenged but then the state did what 
 in mr browns case in north carolina my understanding was is that the state had went and purchased a device to make sure that he was actually unconscious during the procedure and wasnt subject to the excruciating pain thats been detailed within within the briefs that actually was challenged because mr browns attorneys didnt think that the the people that were monitoring the machine were properly trained the court ruled against them and as we know mr brown was was executed it didnt result in the series of challenges as as many are obviously concerned about 
 do you agree that that was not a that method of execution is not a violation of the eighth amendment 
 as far as using the machinery that was used in brown 
 yes 
 i i dont know enough about about that machine to to accurately comment on on that i know that the challenges that were brought in brown wasnt necessarily regarding the machine itself but it was the qualifications of of the people monitoring the machine and whether they had the authority and ability to intervene in the execution itself and i believe that that was the challenge that was ruled upon by the court in mr browns case before he was executed 
 do you know of any method that has been used used throughout the country that is not a violation of the eighth amendment 
 as far as as far as this particular protocol this particular protocol thats thats utilized and that we are we are challenging is unconstitutional because of the excruciating pain if the if the sedative works and theres no and and the person is not in not in wanton and gratuitous type of of pain as as this courts precedents hold that would be constitutional its the its the evidence thats coming forward that this is not whats happening that gives rise to our claim that that we would like to be able to litigate in a N action so that we can get those facts before the court 
 is it only excruciating pain that the eighth amendment prohibits or is it any pain does the eighth amendment require painless execution 
 no absolutely not its its that its its that its wanton and and gratuitous pain 
 well when you say wanton and gratuitous you are you are saying any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated otherwise its gratuitous i assume 
 its its gratuitous when its beyond whats whats necessary and whenever the 
 yes so if theres any way of of execution that is totally painless that that must be pursued 
 if there were a way to do that i i would agree with that 
 where where do you derive that from i mean gee you know that that was certainly never the principle evident in in executions in the past hanging was was not a you know a quick and easy way to go you would have thought they would have required a firing squad instead or something like that i i just dont know where you are deriving this principle that there cannot be any pain associated with the execution 
 i 
 i can understand excruciating pain but but you you want to press it to the point where there cant be any pain associated any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated that seems to me a very extreme proposition 
 the the what what we have detailed here in our complaint is an extreme and tortuous method of of death at this point 
 no i understand what you are challenging here but what what alternative would be acceptable to you only one only one that that to the maximum extent possible eliminates all pain isnt that right 
 well when you look at the when you look at at morales and brown both of those that that were proposed were eliminating for instance one of the options within mr morales case was that only the sodium thiopental be used eliminating the pancuronium bromide and the potassium chloride the state of california for for whatever reason did not did not choose that and went instead and tried to use the same protocol and bringing in anesthesiologists that were properly trained and qualified to determine whether or not mr morales was in fact anesthetized to to a degree where he would not feel that pain that that is that is an example of a proper procedure being being come up with or being dealt with as well mr brown and and thing is is that for theres theres never been a requirement for for us to plead this the reason being is is this courts case law within for example lewis v casey shows the the strong deference that this court gives to states in in coming up with the prison procedures thats not an execution case but here the florida courts not florida courts but the florida officials within the department of correction they know their facilities they know whats capable of of being done there or not 
 would it be if if in the future if states specify the method of execution in the sentence then you would not have a N action is that correct because you would then be challenging the sentence and it would have to be brought under habeas 
 if the particular protocol that was alleged in the sentence yes it would be ripe at that point in time as opposed to floridas system where its within its within the discretion of the department of correction to change it at any time we have seen that happen whenever the electric chair litigation was going on that they changed these procedures over time adding and detracting different things 
 well but but you you their procedure was set forth in a in a notice a regulation or something you you had notice of what procedure they intended to use several years ago didnt you 
 the only 
 now you are saying they could change it in the future but sure of course any any agency can change its its regulations but didnt you know that this is the procedure they intended to use several years ago 
 no your honor it was what they relied upon was what was what was detailed in sims which was N years ago but with the with the discretion that florida department of corrections has and that they have exhibited in the past that they have utilized that discretion whenever we were having the electric chair litigation going on we cant presume that the added problem is 
 so you have to wait to you have to wait to the eve of execution before before you think you have a a ripe claim under under habeas 
 under under floridas scheme yes we have to wait because they have the complete discretion we have no access to be able to get the public records in fact we have been denied throughout 
 congress has the complete discretion to change the statutes its enacted but that doesnt mean that you cant change you cant challenge a statute now because it might be changed before before the action you want to take occurs you can challenge it now and it seems to me its the same thing with the method of execution prescribed by by an administrative agency in in a state 
 if congress has the situation set up that florida does not engage in in rulemaking they dont go through an orderly administrative process taking public input and having people come and participate in that its totally 
 well what did they have there was the sims case no no certainly not in the legislation theres no rule that emerges but you did know that there was a lethal injection procedure that had been prescribed for another prisoner and yet you didnt challenge the lethal injection at that time why did you wait until so late 
 because because that claim was not ripe at that time because we didnt know what would be utilized whenever it came to mr hill being executed our knowledge as to how florida department of corrections utilizes that discretion has been that they actually used that discretion in the past we have not been able to get any records postsims regarding their procedures regarding the protocol 
 have they in fact changed the procedure for the lethal injection 
 i dont have any public records to to be able to say one way or another we were denied all public records whenever we were proceeding in state court 
 when did you ask for the public when did you ask for the a a statement of the protocol that would be used in your case 
 it was december the N th is whenever it began and then pursuant to the courts the trial courts order that was entered in that case the states response came on december N th the court ruled on december N rd the rehearing was denied on the N th and we filed our briefs in the florida supreme court on january N rd 
 i dont understand how did you get into the court if you didnt know what protocol they were going to use 
 once 
 you say you didnt know it until the N th when your case was already in the court what what were you challenging 
 what we what had happened is is whenever the whenever the death warrant was signed on november N th that put into play florida rule of criminal procedure N which then entitles us to more records that we are not entitled to before a warrant is signed at at that point we filed our records request and the trial court indeed put forth their order as to when everybody was to respond and have various pleadings in we 
 excuse me how did the trial court get into it does the records request go through through a trial court 
 yes 
 what what is the the action that you are bringing an action for records request 
 yes its under florida rule of criminal procedure its geared specifically to deathsentenced individuals as opposed to being we dont have available whats under florida statute chapter N is not available to a deathsentenced inmate so we must proceed through the N procedures and that was not activated until the point in time that the warrant was actually signed we filed other pleadings in the court that were denied regarding mental retardation regarding a roper claim and various other other claims ultimately we also filed in regards to the public records claim and us being denied the public records and the ability to assess the protocol florida 
 may may i ask you to clarify one thing i take it at this point there isnt any question about the the amounts and ingredients that will be used in if if the execution goes forward but my recollection is that you said that your your request for a specification of this formula or protocol was denied by florida did you ever as a result of your records request or otherwise get a statement directly from florida to you that the following proportions of chemicals will be used 
 within the within the public records proceeding it was referenced that it would be the same as as sims florida department of corrections 
 but until you went into that proceeding i take it you had asked florida to specify and florida said no it would not do so 
 we had asked for the records and had requested the records that would specify and any written procedures and protocol as well as the records from from prior executions they fought that and prevailed in the trial court and in the florida supreme court we had also sought records from the medical examiner that does the autopsies on executed individuals as well as various other officials we thought might have information we were we were given nothing and they objected to us receiving any records whatsoever 
 did did you ever say to to any florida official please tell me what the chemicals are and the amounts that will be used 
 we 
 not asking for records just asking for a statement about what they were going to do 
 it it came forward at the at the hearing regarding the public records that it was going to be the sims that it was going to be the sims procedure 
 but i guess before you went into court with a public records action did you ever say to somebody tell us what you are going to do 
 by our public records request yes if if your honor is asking if i spoke to the 
 what what im getting at is 
 department of corrections no 
 there there are ways to find out one would be to ask one would be to chop the door down with an ax to find out if theres a statement hidden inside did you ever try the easy way and simply say to them will you specify for us what you are going to do and how you are going to do this 
 that was essentially done at the public records hearing on december N th whenever they came in and said it was that it was sims 
 okay 
 the the thing is is 
 well you you alleged in your complaint im looking at footnote N that you assumed they were going to follow the same protocol as in sims 
 because of their because of of the representations that were made during the public records litigation that was based upon that was what we based our assumption on knowing that they still had the ability to change it all the way up until the date that mr hill was scheduled to be executed 
 well they still do but you are here i mean they they still have the opportunity to change it but you are here challenging it even though it is still changeable right 
 they yes because of the way florida operates with the total discretion and and the refusal to give any public records regarding this yes we are in the dark regarding it they could they could alleviate that situation by doing an administrative rulemaking process that that rule is then in place and with that rule in place it would be ripe at that point because at that point they are constrained to follow the rule as opposed to having the liberty to to change the procedures as they as they deem fit at the last minute 
 can i just clarify one thing for myself do i correctly understand that the federal district court im not talking about the state court did not rule on the merits of your claim but merely held that N is not the proper method of pursuing the claim 
 thats correct 
 so that there hasnt been a decision by a federal judge on whether or not theres merit to your case 
 that is correct 
 its just a question of which whether you do it by way of habeas corpus or by N 
 that is that is correct and it was recharacterized as as a successive habeas petition rather than a N action 
 and i suppose its entirely possible that if the judge then decided it is really if we said it should have been a N action the judge could say well okay even under N the state has the defense of laches and you still lose i mean you we dont know whats going to happen if we find out if we agree with what your argument in this court is is that right 
 it would go back for for an analysis as to the equities of the situation and and that being an intensely factbound procedure the district court is actually in in a better position to go ahead and and be able to make that analysis there at the district court level a gomez analysis as to the equities that are involved within the situation so as as we sit here today there has not been any ruling on the merits of of this and there hasnt been any evidence produced in in any court through testimony whatsoever regarding the issues of the protocol and and things of of that nature that we have been discussing here this morning and i think that that whenever whenever you you look at actually if the court doesnt have any more questions im going to reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you counsel ms snurkowski we will hear now from you 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court the state is here today to suggest that the method that to challenge these claims is by habeas corpus and that the federal district court as well as the eleventh circuit was correct in finding that the district court had correctly found it had no jurisdiction because in fact it was a functional equivalent of the habeas corpus but to to address some of the issues that were currently brought before the court today with regard to the ability of the defendant to come forward and discern what exactly was the method by which florida was intending to execute him the record bears out that in fact the sims case was in the public domain and in fact is the method by which florida does execute individuals there was 
 but theres no statute and theres no regulation that requires florida to do that 
 these there is no specific statute the statute itself merely says that lethal injection is the method by which florida is to execute individuals the department of corrections through rulemaking process internally provides protocols for the execution day and other protocols with regard to the execution team performing its function on that given day and and hours leading up to that and that has not been changed nor modified nor has it been challenged 
 but there is no statute no regulation that means the executive can do what it will theres nothing that binds them to the way it was done in sims case 
 that is correct to the extent that theres no statutory provision or regulatory rule because in fact under florida the florida legislature has exempted rulemaking of the department of corrections with regard to executions 
 and i suppose thats thats the complaint if there was a procedure in place we could address it if florida reserves to itself the ability to change at any time well thats we want to be told what it will be in our particular case so we have a target that we can aim at 
 and i understand that but the state would contend that based on the fact that there have N executions since the time that sims has occurred and all those executions have been performed exactly as the manner in which sims has occurred and that there has not been any challenge to a deviance from that and in fact the florida supreme court has ratified again in this case when mr hill brought his eighth amendment claim that sims was the method of execution in florida i think we have a very reasoned determination that in fact the method of execution as it has been proposed in sims is currently the method of execution that we utilize 
 but what he i i take it the ripeness issue is he delayed in bringing it because he wasnt certain what youd do and and one of the reasons i think would be that its only recently there was an article in the lancet 
 correct 
 that says the in the opinion of the doctors who wrote it a significant number of executed people are conscious when they die and thats painful and then its been suggested there are ways around that just give them more sodium pentothal or have a doctor or somebody there to make certain the individual is unconscious at the time that the deathcausing drugs take effect all right now that doesnt seem too difficult maybe its difficult but it doesnt seem too difficult so why cant they think you know florida they can read there too they have people who read these articles and indeed maybe they will just do it they dont have any real interest in in causing suffering why dont they just do it and so he thinks up until the last minute that maybe florida will just do it and lo and behold when the death warrant is actually executed it now begins to appear that they wont and therefore at that time he brings the case now i have spun out a story which seems probable but if its true it would be very understandable why this wasnt ripe before the execution warrant is issued and thereafter it is now what is your reply on the ripeness question 
 well my reply on the ripeness question is first of all that i dont believe that your scenario while i will accept your scenario as your scenario it is not accurate with regard to what occurred in florida but apart from that there has not been a change and nor has there been any allegations by the defendant he certainly as you have indicated could have read and in fact did read the lancet article and made no statements with regard to his allegations 
 my my little story was inaccurate as to florida or accurate as to florida 
 im sorry 
 is the kind of thing i was explaining why it would be ripe i think is that accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what happened in florida 
 no and my answer i would suggest to you is no 
 no 
 because i think its part of the pleadings i mean he certainly had the wherewithal if he felt that there was another manner by which it could have been changed or that the department of corrections in this particular instance was suddenly going to now aware of the lancet article would change its method he has not made any allegations of that nor has he asked and that was one of the questions that was postulated to him the fact that in that he never asked 
 would he have to come up 
 excuse me 
 with as you suggest an alternative that would be acceptable suppose there had been a hearing and it was proved more probable than not that in some cases not in all but in some cases use of this injection would cause excruciating pain would the petitioner who is objecting being exposed to that have to come up with an alternative in order to avoid the risk of excruciating pain 
 well it seems to me based on this courts decision in nelson that that was the focal point of why relief was granted in the fashion it was that it was a proper issue to rely in N because in fact there might be a he had proposed a mechanism that might be alternative mechanism that was accepted by the government in this instance its the record is silent and which goes 
 well my question to you is i take it you are answering yes that if they prove that some people will be subject to excruciating pain thats not good enough unless the petitioner proposes an alternative that its all right for the state to expose someone to the risk of what has what has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain as long as the petitioner himself doesnt come up with an alternative 
 well i think the answer is twofold first of all the fact that the articles out there reflect that theres a potential that that could happen theres not been evidence that it has occurred or has happened which has been necessarily what is the precursor to when there has been changes in the method of execution because there has been a history where in fact a botched execution has occurred no matter what the method may have been the second part is that there has not be a a specific showing in this particular case nor an allegation for that matter that any kind of event in this particular case would in fact cause excruciating or any kind of pain 
 well because theres been no hearing we have never gotten past is this can you open the door through N and i i still dont understand what your answer is to my question now im supposing that we do have the N hearing and the judge says yes i agree with the petitioners experts in some cases there will be excruciating pain then you say but judge they havent come up with an alternative 
 correct 
 and the judge says you are both right some people have excruciating pain but theres been no alternative suggested bottom line of that particular case would be 
 that in fact i think that he has to make some colorable showing of an alternative that would be acceptable to him based on the procedures because again the second prong of that seems to me 
 so the answer is yes 
 yes your honor im sorry 
 the court having found that some people will be subject to excruciating pain still no eighth amendment violation because the petitioner hasnt come up with an alternative 
 yes 
 what is the source of his obligation to do this i mean why does he have an obligation under the eighth amendment or under any other ground to tell the state how to execute people 
 well i think the court in its nelson opinion suggested that that was a means 
 that that was a fact in nelson but my question to you is if if we were to agree with you and say that that in fact is a is an element of a N action here what would be the source of of the the conclusion that that he has to propose a less painful alternative 
 i guess part of the source would be the fact that in overcoming the qualifications while maybe his pleading may be simple the notion is that he has to overcome those things that may have happened in the past for example in this particular instance whether in fact theres been any violation as to a a res judicata collateral estoppel 
 no but i mean thats not thats not the issue im not asking you about res judicata im saying that if he comes into court and as justice ginsburg suggested in her hypo his experts demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fact finder that there will in a certain number of cases be excruciating pain and he is at least within the risk of that your response is we are still that is no grounds for enjoining the execution under N we can still execute unless he comes up with a proposal for a less painful way of doing it and what i want to know is why does he have such an obligation why isnt it enough for him to show that there is a probability that he will suffer excruciating pain 
 well i think for one point it would be that in fact if the state had chosen or selected a method or a change in the modification of the method that was not acceptable to him then wed be still back at square zero 
 no justice souter and justice ginsburg can protect their own questions part of that allegation in here is that the state wasnt forthcoming with the with with the information requested and you are not very forthcoming with the answers what is the source what is the legal source what is the precedent for the proposition that the that the condemned man has to come up with an alternative what case do you cite what principle do you cite 
 the principle im 
 thats what we are asking 
 yes your honor and im sorry that i was in any way disingenuous but the bottom line is i think that nelson is the bottom line source of of concern that we would bring forth to this court that if in fact 
 but it was mentioned it was mentioned in nelson but what would be the reason for for elevating that that fact in nelson to a requirement what is the legal principle that would support your argument 
 i think the legal principle being that the individual who is coming forth and seeking to have the execution or requesting some relief he has to come forward with some evidence some some body of law 
 but isnt there evidence in i noticed the brief filed by some veterinarians call our attention to the statute that prohibits the euthanasia of dogs and cats unless they follow a certain procedure so there must have been a legislative feeling that unless that procedure were followed theres a risk of undue pain to the dogs and cats why isnt there a similar basis for believing that if you dont follow a similar procedure that such a risk might be present for human beings 
 and that that has been an allegation and that has been raised before the courts over the years with regard to that 
 and whats your response to it 
 that in fact recent recent development and i mean we are talking about an area that has not we have not gotten that far we dont have a record 
 but your procedure if i understand it would be prohibited to be applied to dogs or cats 
 but the procedure that procedure there is there is legal information or or scientific information out there that or refutes that and that in fact theres a different mechanism and thats 
 well at least it was sufficiently convincing to get the florida legislature to pass a statute 
 thats thats correct with regard to that particular aspect because it was one needle being used and all the drugs were being used in that needle but that is again 
 counsel i would have thought your your answer to the line of questioning earlier was that the reason that the petitioner has to come up with this an alternative is that otherwise its plausible at least to suspect the reason hes bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution itself rather than the particular method and that if its a challenge to the execution itself it has to be brought under habeas if its just a challenge to the method it can be brought under N if hes unwilling to say there is a valid method then it starts to look like a challenge to the execution that has to be brought under habeas 
 and and that is the core position the state has taken and im sorry if i did not articulate that in a fashion that 
 but in respect to that core position i can understand the states concern with the possibility of abuse but in nelson what the court says is it points to gomez and gomez was a N case and there the court denied a stay of the execution because it looked into the history of the litigation and they said that this particular individual had done just what worries you though in a somewhat different context he kept bringing the cases and every time you know hed lose then hed think of another way of making the same point and in your context it would be first he challenges this method and he says there are others that are fine so we go to another then he challenges that then he challenges that then he challenges that always at the very last minute so theres a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that you worry about occurs so why do we need something else like an absolute rule of some sort that the petitioner has to think of a method of execution a matter on which he is not necessarily expert that would turn out in the future to be not painful i mean you dont need to put on your overcoat and also turn up the heat 
 but 
 you have got the case that helps you if that occurs why do you need to argue for something else 
 well and the only reason we are arguing for something else it seems to me that the basis upon which we are here today is to determine whether N or habeas will lie and apart from that im trying to make an argument to the extent i have or not that that this is more in keeping with habeas as opposed to N litigation thank you 
 thank you counsel mr shanmugam we will hear now from you 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court where a prisoner challenges a particular method of execution but fails to identify a permissible alternative that claim is functionally equivalent to a claim challenging the prisoners death sentence per se and therefore must be brought 
 why is that why is that that that in which case it would be like like heck right it would come within the heck principles 
 well our view is that the heck principle is not applicable here where a prisoner is seeking relief that is indisputably available in habeas our view is that the governing precedent and really the touchstone here is this courts decision in preiser v rodriguez which drew the distinction that the court has long recognized between claims challenging the conditions of a prisoners confinement and claims challenging the fact or duration of that confinement now to be sure that analogy is not exactly apt in the capital context but we believe that where a prisoner identifies a permissible alternative it is that which renders the claim 
 well well why but i mean suppose he doesnt okay but its absolutely clear hes not saying all methods are unconstitutional hes saying this method is unconstitutional if he says this method of constitutional and he wins then his challenge will not necessarily prevent the state from carrying out its execution and of course im reading to you directly from nelson v campbell that would seem right in point and why isnt that the end of this case 
 well we do believe that where a prisoner brings an openended claim of the type at issue here it would necessarily prevent the state from carrying out the execution in one relevant sense namely it would prevent the state from carrying out the execution 
 yes and if i bring a claim that my prison cell is so cold i actually get pneumonia and die or near it and then i challenge the coldness of the cell im preventing my confinement in one particular way 
 well thats exactly 
 its a cold cell and so that would similarly on your theory be habeas but we know it isnt 
 well no i dont think that thats true and i do think that the 
 my cold cell is habeas 
 no i think that the cold cell case clearly is a conditions of confinement claim and let me explain to you justice breyer if i may the reason that the identification of an alternative is so critical it is the identification of an alternative that renders the claim the functional equivalent of a conditions of confinement claim because a conditions of confinement claim is really necessarily predicated on the assumption that the prisoner will continue to serve exactly the same sentence even if the claim is successful in your hypothetical if a prisoner claims that his cell is too cold the necessary implication is that the prisoner will be able to continue to be imprisoned at some higher temperature even if the prisoner does not specify in his complaint that he wants to be held at N degrees or N degrees and that is the reason why the identification of the alternative is so important 
 why more than in nelson 
 well in nelson it was important and we would submit that it was really the dispositive factor in the courts analysis the court noted the fact that the state had conceded the prisoner had identified and the state had conceded that an alternative method could be used to administer the execution 
 i didnt i didnt get your explanation had you finished it 
 yes 
 let me try let me let me try again through a different route though where a prisoner fails to identify an alternative the risk here is that such a claim could delay and may in fact prevent the ultimate execution of the death sentence 
 what about the risks that the prisoner will die an excruciating death im asking you the same question that i asked cocounsel what happens then he hasnt been able to come up with an alternative but the judge finds it credible that he may be exposed to an excruciating death what then 
 well in that case he may very well have a valid eighth amendment claim but our principal submission 
 but would 
 is that he cannot proceed in a section N action presumably what would happen 
 why not because hes saying i am not asking for this to be one day further along im just asking the state to give me a death that will not require me to suffer excruciating pain 
 well again the concern with the claim that fails to identify a permissible alternative is the risk of seriatim litigation and i think that the history not only of the nelson case but also of some of the ongoing litigation most notably the morales case in california demonstrates that that risk is a very real one where a prisoner fails to identify an alternative method it is not 
 except let me just interrupt supposing he did identify say you can only use pentobarbital on me the same way they do it for a veterinarian and the and the judge says well i dont think thats required but he would then be satisfied the N requirement 
 well the state would at least have the option in that case 
 of saying no 
 of acquiescing in the alternative the state would of course have the option of saying no and litigating it 
 but do you agree if he had said i propose alternative x even though its highly unlikely the state will accept it that would make it a N action 
 that would make it a N action and the critical point as this court recognized 
 even though theres no functional difference in terms of future litigation between that case and this 
 well the only reason that there would be no functional difference is if the state chose to in fact litigate the issue notwithstanding his identification of the permissible alternative and in nelson 
 so you are saying saying then that the defense bar the capital punishment bar and the prisoners are the group of people that have to go and do the research on humane methods of putting people to death rather than the government 
 well i 
 that strikes me as a little odd doesnt it 
 i would i would respectfully submit justice breyer that that is exactly the kind of research that they would have to do in order to bring the claim in the first place 
 why 
 i dont think i dont think thats the research they would do i think the research they would do would be to come up with another method that the state certainly would not find acceptable thereupon rendering it a N action and and leaving everything in the same status that its that it is here i mean i dont see that you have accomplished anything by simply demanding that they that they come up with an alternative they are going to come up with a with an unacceptable alternative 
 well the alternative at a minimum has to be 
 it it might be malpractice not to come up with with an unacceptable alternative 
 at a minimum the alternative has to be one that is permissible under currently governing law 
 old age they will come with that alternative old age right 
 well that would not presumably that would not be a method of execution at all 
 this this is a death case it was not that amusing let me ask you this doesnt the state have some minimal obligation under the eighth amendment to do the necessary research to assure that this is the most humane method possible doesnt the state have a minimal obligation on its own to do that 
 im not sure whether it it would have an obligation to use the most humane method under the eighth amendment because this courts cases have only suggested that the gratuitous infliction of pain is barred by the eighth amendment im not aware of any cases 
 well i can define gratuitous i dont have the dictionary here but gratuitous means essentially unnecessary if there were other other means other alternatives that might be used it seems to me that the state might have some minimal obligation to investigate those 
 well i think more broadly justice kennedy that one reason that states do have discretion in this area and i think that florida is not unusual in that regard is that prison officials are expected to adopt to evolving methods of execution and to take into account changes that might suggest that a particular method is problematic and so whether or not there is a constitutional obligation i think that there is every reason to think that states will in fact do that i think that it is noteworthy 
 but is there is there in this case i mean the lancet article has been out there for a while and it certainly is enough to suggest in your words that there is something problematic about the manner in which florida proposes to do this and yet we have not heard a word that florida has made any effort whatsoever to find an alternative or for that matter to to disprove what the lancet article suggests and so its one thing for you to say the states have discretion i dont think that answers justice kennedys question as to why the state does not have an obligation to fulfill its constitutional duty to execute without gratuitous pain and i dont see why you have given any answer to to the proposal that that obligation requires the state to do some investigation of its own 
 well whether or not the state has that obligation it may very well have that obligation as a constitutional matter but putting that to one side it does seem as if the critical question is whether or not the state in fact has adopted a method that inflicts cruel and unusual punishment and where a prisoner has a claim of that variety a prisoner has other options if the prisoner is unwilling to identify a permissible alternative to bring that claim besides 
 we have we have never held that anyway have we 
 and the court has never held that 
 that the state must in in imposing the death penalty use a method that inflicts the least amount of pain 
 the court has not held that instead it has 
 and presumably theres some range between most humane and whats cruel and unusual right 
 well i think that that is presumably true based on the formulations that this court has used which have repeatedly focused on the gratuitous or wanton infliction of pain as opposed to the least painful method 
 mr shanmugam several of the emergency death proceedings we have had involving this question the district court judges have assumed that it could proceed under N but then denied relief because it was brought on the eve of execution as this one was is that option available to the district court in this case if its sent back 
 it is available to the district court and indeed it would potentially be available even to this court as a matter of first instance as it was in the gomez case thank you 
 thank you counsel mr doss you have N minutes remaining 
 you know it it is true that the N is a civil action and the plaintiff has the burden of proof burden of producing evidence 
 that is true that is true and we would be prepared to do that if we were allowed to go back and and proceed we have produced evidence at the at the pleadings stage and as we sit here today since there hasnt been an answered filed our our pleadings are are accepted as as true for as a matter of procedure the interesting thing is is that is that florida created this problem they can they can lay it out as to how to euthanize dogs and cats but they cant do it for humans thats perfectly in the open yet they shroud this in secrecy we cant get public records we cant N of the florida code of criminal procedure prevents us from going and getting these records before 
 do you think there was adequate time for the district court to fully consider the evidence you intended to present and consider your claim and still proceed with the execution that was scheduled 
 no 
 you filed your case N days before the execution 
 no but we were put in that posture by by the way the state of florida has chosen to to vest this total discretion shroud everything in secrecy and then complain that we didnt bring it earlier when we 
 the sims protocol was there as a matter of public domain you said in your complaint yourself when you didnt get any information you said well i assume they are going to follow sims why wasnt that assumption valid N months before N months before or a year before 
 because at that point i knew that they had total discretion i knew that before they had changed their protocols when the electric chair litigation was going on indeed the florida legislature changed the entire statute when this court accepted mr bryants case 
 well it seems to me that you might you might have alleged that that you have read articles lancet articles and so forth and that there is a substantial risk that they are going to do this i think that might suffice 
 that 
 and and it would it would mean that the as the chief justice indicates the court has more time to look at this 
 as far as as far as the the ripeness issue its not because of the way florida chose to do their procedure it was not ripe and it doesnt comport with this courts basic ripeness doctrine that we are going to presume its going to be done a certain way when the state can come in and say its not ripe for review we we still have the ability to change this rather than us coming 
 suppose you suppose you never were told by florida what the how exactly it was going to be done does that mean you never could have brought a N claim even on the day the scheduled day of execution 
 if they if they never told us i guess we would be in in a position of of assuming sims is in place but the thing is is that its an equitable its an equitable argument and florida is not coming forward with clean hands they created this and then they just want to say well you should have known we are not going to do anything to help you we are going to shroud this in secrecy and not tell anybody 
 suppose suppose they did set it forth but reserved the right to change it they promulgated a regulation without public notice without hearings or anything this is our regulation this is how we intend to conduct executions in the future period we reserve the right to change this would you claim that that this was not ripe you couldnt challenge it at that point 
 at that 
 because they could change it 
 if your honor if your honors fact situation includes a presumption that thats going to be the presumed method i think at that point yes 
 no this is the current method that we intend to use in all future executions period we may change our mind 
 at that point yes because they they are stating that they intend upon using that rather 
 dont dont you think you you 
 rather than playing hide the ball 
 dont you think effectively had that knowledge when you knew knew about sims and you knew about all of the cases after sims is that very much short of of their saying this is the the procedure we intend to use 
 absolutely not we only knew about sims we asked for records regarding all the executions since sims we have not received it 
 i i understand your your argument to be and i dont think you are making it here but i understood your argument elsewhere to be we knew about sims but when they stonewalled us and said we wont tell you what we are going to use we had reason to question whether they were going to follow sims isnt isnt that your point 
 yes and that only came into play at the point 
 no you alleged the exact opposite in footnote N you said when they stonewalled you we assumed they were going to follow sims 
 they stonewalled us only after the warrant was signed because we couldnt do anything at at the point before the warrant was signed to be able to try to to gather evidence as to what it was going to be and we were never 
 finish 
 we were never told that and because the way florida has created their system we were prevented from doing that thank you 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear arguments next in lawrence v florida ms bonner 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court mr lawrence in this case made an application for relief in the state courts of florida that unfortunately was denied to him the relief that he sought consequently he came here to the united states supreme court on a certiorari review and the certiorari although it was denied he did present to this court an issue on which it could have acted had it chosen to act it is well within the power under N usc N for this court to modify vacate remand in other words this court can and could have affected that judgment our position is that this there is a distinction between the quote appellate jurisdiction under N and the original writ of certiorari which would lie in this court in some instances when one uses the appeal one is not making a new application we respectfully suggest that the utilization of the emphasis in N should be on application and what was before this court on petition for certiorari was the application the document the issues which had been presented below in the florida courts and this court was sitting to determine whether it would 
 it would presumably though be limited in some ways for example if the application for state postconviction relief raised arguments under state law those would not be a proper subject of a petition for certiorari 
 absolutely not your honor and the issues which were raised were the same ones that were raised in the state court and were of constitutional dimension that mr lawrence raised here but our point is if the emphasis is on the application then until the finality of action on the application 
 you are saying the application is the application the petition for certiorari is the application 
 no sir im saying the application under N in florida state trial courts which then goes to the florida state supreme court is the application upon which this court would be acting if it were not acting on that what would it be acting on 
 well we cant act on it unless unless its final we we need final action by the state court dont we 
 well except 
 how can it be final action and yet still be pending 
 to utilize the word final there would be we can use the word final after a jury determination and that in one effect in one sense is final and when florida is done its final in some sense but its not final under N because this court can modify it can remand it 
 its final as far as the application for state review is concerned 
 there it is the 
 which is the text that we are dealing with here 
 yes it is the application for state review which comes before this court we are asking you to review the lower courts rulings on the application 
 i take it you are talking about language if i followed it in N 
 yes sir 
 and it tolled the statute while the properly filed application for state postconviction or other collateral review is pending so the question is during the N days after they said no to you in the state court and you had a chance to file the writ is that application pending and you say yes that application is pending that application is pending and subject to various motions such as a motion or a petition for certiorari 
 yes sir 
 but it is pending 
 yes sir that is 
 thats where we are in this argument 
 that is exactly our position 
 thank you 
 that this application is pending 
 of course the other way to read the language is that the state application is final otherwise you couldnt file the federal petition for certiorari and that petition may affect what happens with your application for state relief but the state application itself is final and over 
 in that sense it is not final in that it can be altered and that this court can order 
 well it has to be final before you can file a petition for cert 
 yes sir its the vagaries of the use of the language 
 does it say that i would have thought it said that there has to be a final judgment of the lower court and the final judgment of the state court concerns that application which is still pending and will continue to be pending at least for N days in your view 
 yes 
 so it doesnt require a final state application it requires a final judgment about the state application 
 yes thats exactly true sir 
 so what about the argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesnt require filing a petition for certiorari that the state procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final decision in the state court and that it makes sense to treat this this N in a parallel way with respect to the exhaustion requirement 
 well your honor first of all it would require this court to substitute the word exhaustion for the word pending in the statute there is no reason to believe and there is much reason not to believe that congress intended exhaustion has a concept which should be read into this particular context in which we are dealing in point of fact in the N proposal for habeas reform the word exhaustion was in there it was taken out in N unfortunately the congressional history and the speeches on the floor etcetera are not really illuminating except the concept of exhaustion apparently the legislature the congress felt would be subject to interpretation differently in different states 
 how do you know what is pending with respect to when the state defendant movant doesnt file a petition for certiorari is that 
 well i believe 
 is the state postconviction application still pending on the N th day 
 i believe it is your honor and i think the logic that this court has used in the context of N s obtains as well and it it is pending because the reason that we have N days its an unusual amount of time that we have to come to ask this court for relief and i believe that part of that time and part of the reason for the existence of that is that we can contemplate whether we should be filing a petition for certiorari 
 well anybody who wants the additional time this law was passed to prevent people from delaying but anybody who wanted to delay would then have to file a cert petition i assume 
 i would suggest to you your honor that it should be this should be construed the same way that the finality of a state conviction the finality of a federal conviction and the finality of a N are determined and that is at the time that either this court has dealt with certiorari by denying or granting it or that N days has has been 
 but if you filed so you say you get N days whether you file or not 
 yes i do sir 
 but if you want the additional time that it takes for an opposition for waiver of response for this court to dispose of it then you have to file a petition for cert 
 i dont that is not my position your honor i believe that the N days should obtain no matter what so that we will have a universal rule 
 right 
 that practitioners will not be making this error because they will be acting in concert 
 but the chiefs point is that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being more than N days because then you would have in addition to the N days youd have to file the cert petition the time it takes for this court to dispose of the petition and the statute of limitations would be tolled throughout that entire period not just a fixed N days 
 that is true maam 
 do you does your argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within the N days wanted to file in the district court wanted to file the habeas application in the district court within the N days couldnt do so because it would be premature because the the state application is still pending 
 i believe that the way that we have been seeing the opinions come from this court and from the various courts around the country are that there seems to be a favorable disposition to protective N N petitions i agree with the premise of your honors question that it would be pending and it would be pending here and therefore you should not go to district court and file a N now whether you can and you can do it in a protective fashion is another entire issue which isnt really raised here because he did seek certiorari review 
 do you read the tolling provision in N the same way as you read the tolling provision thats before us 
 no certainly i do not and the state really did not analogize to N as i believe perhaps they should have analogized to it N of course is the optin provision which moves things along on an even quicker track than a one year and you have N days to file and the congress was absolutely clear and this was enacted at the same time that the provisions at issue were enacted that it was N days after final state court affirmance and you had to you had to file thats it 
 do you think congress really wanted to have two different entirely different tolling concepts in these provisions 
 i think they did and one of the reasons that i believe that they did number one was to achieve their goal of moving things faster if the states were able to guarantee counsel and the second is that they told as well in N the main difference between N and is that the time when you are getting your certiorari petition ready for this court under the optin provision is not tolled but the time when this court is considering the postconviction certiorari request is tolled its tolled clearly by statute i cannot presume and would not presume that what congress did was write these in numerical order and when it got to N come up with a new and exciting idea and then not go back to N and N to change the language there i think congress meant something different and what it meant was the trigger time the time that was going to be elapsing between the petition between your final decision and when you could go to certiorari 
 you know what about N where congress referred expressly to the time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review your reading of d is that thats what they meant when they said the state application was pending the state application or the time for seeking review of the state application and in just in just a few sections above that they expressly said that shouldnt we read pending in a different different direction 
 well the distinction i have at least two things to say about that the distinction between the two sections that would be and one is dealing with one thing a judgment which has reached finality and it is determining when that judgment is final they would have had to rewrite the tolling provision because it is not speaking about a judgment it is speaking about an application which is a process and the second thing is that 
 well they would have just said during the time of the application for state postconviction or the expiration of the time for seeking review of it 
 i believe that congress is presumed to have read written its laws knowing the history of interpretation of this court and pending has a very long tradition and this courts role in the statefederal continuum obviously is of well defined N plusyearold role and the part of that role is that you as this court are the final arbiters and the only true people who can make the decision about what the federal constitution says the state would have you read this as if it says application for state postconviction relief is pending in the state court i would be hesitant to rewrite the statute since congress did not invite me to do so as the state has actually done by saying pending in the in the state court and that is not the concept that we have lived with for N years or N plus years pending means until it is cannot be any longer acted upon and it is clear here you as this court can upon it 
 do you think the final the judgment in the criminal case is still pending because it can be acted upon 
 not the judgment in the criminal case but i would suggest that the judgment in the N i mean the N procedures in florida which would be that postconviction application because thats where we are we have reached finality on the after this court has had after we have either come to this court for certiorari or the N days is exhausted 
 are you saying are you arguing that there during this period there is an application for state relief pending in the state courts or that there is an application for state relief pending in this court 
 i am saying that the application in state court is yet pending when it is here because that court can be ordered by 
 where is it pending 
 this court to act upon it 
 where is it pending 
 it is pending still in state court because this court can order that court 
 i thought your argument on brief was that it is pending here and the statute says pending it doesnt say pending as your statute you compared it with says that pending the application is pending someplace where is it pending not in the state court anymore they have reached their final judgment but its still pending in your case here because you filed a petition for cert 
 yes maam it just is also i there is some case law which speaks to the fact that it remains pending or unsettled or unsure or unfinal when a court can order another court to act on it 
 in the same sense that it is pending after the trial court has acted but before the defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants a state appeal 
 yes sir 
 i dont know where its pending whether its still pending in the state trial court or in the state appeals court but nobody denies that its pending and i understood your argument to be whatever mending means there pending means here because there is no modifier that would limit the same the same construction 
 yes that is that is so sir 
 but in what sense is it an application for state postconviction review when its pending before us we are considering a claim that the state erroneously decided a federal question 
 you are 
 but its not an application its an application for our review not state postconviction review 
 it began as a complaint this is analytically everyone seems to have a little bit of pause because of exactly the context of your of your comment of your question but there is only one lawsuit complaint whatever you wish to call it which we are dealing with and that is the one that seeks postconviction relief in florida if you are unsuccessful there you go to the florida supreme court and that same application is what we come to this court on there is nothing else out there the state seems to tell us or suggest to us that its some kind of an independent state uh federal action 
 its a federal writ isnt it its an application for a federal writ its not an appeal in state criminal state case 
 but it comes under this courts appellate jurisdiction versus its original jurisdiction for writs of certiorari 
 if you succeed you are going to get an order from this court to the state court say saying go back in this state proceeding that has been begun and do it right so the focus of it is still the state proceeding even though we may correct it under appellate jurisdiction 
 yes sir the state brings forward an argument that this certiorari before this court is not a part of not an integral part of and in fact not any part of the state process i believe they come to that conclusion because they insert what they wish the statute said rather than what the statute actually says and we are attempting as best we can to interpret what congress did not what you wish it did 
 do you have any i suppose this we ought to know better but how long the average disposition time is for a petition for certiorari in a case like this 
 i believe its like N days if you dont 
 no from the time of i suppose the pertinent question would be from the time of final state final state judgment eventual filing for petition for cert opposition waiver our disposition presumably probably five or six months 
 its not usually that long this court is very efficient with that and thats one of the points 
 well why dont you take lets just if say you take N days and you get 
 you get N or so 
 and you get a two month extension 
 yes 
 then you get another month for the opposition depending on what circuit you are from for the extension get another month for the opposition at least two months month and a half for us to dispose of it it probably comes out to about six months 
 it could your honor 
 now i guess my question is in a law that imposed a oneyear statute of limitation is this an implicit additional i realize its a question begging to some extent but implicitly an additional sixmonth period would strike me as odd 
 well your honor it is not a oneyear statute of limitations per se that may be what looks good on paper with the writing of the statute and the expressing of the statute to the public that one year is whats going to happen but when one takes into account the exhaustion requirement and takes that time out we are still not talking about a N day process 
 let me ask on that ms bonner what typically in florida is the time elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal proceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral relief 
 its quite a while your honor i wouldnt know the average 
 but its more than six months i assume 
 its a long time your honor and 
 two three four five years 
 yes sir 
 and all that time the statute has been tolled 
 exactly till its thats why i dont look at exactly 
 the question is whether there may be another six months added on to that five or sixyear period 
 yes sir and one of the important things here is 
 well the reason thats tolled is because its designed to encourage the exhaustion of the state procedures this additional period is when its pending not before the state but before a federal court 
 but its the state petition which is pending for your review and one of the things i want to point out is that the N days when they passed habeas reform they were not speaking about N days N days N days N days or even the six months that your honor posits it was N years N years N years and that was i think the major impetus to encourage the congress to put the N day on there this court has complete control over the certiorari process you know being lawyers we always do file at the last minute but of course its this courts rules which gives us the N days versus another period of time it is the petition for certiorari is not like a notice of appeal because its not just a onepage document thats laid out in the federal statutes for us to do its an application to its an application for review and it is it takes some time to fashion 
 any any statistics on how many petitions for cert from state postconviction collateral review are granted in other words if we are talking about an additional six months in every case how many of those are actually granted 
 i dont know how many are granted your honor but one thing that struck me as i was reading through these cases is that many are granted to the state and of course when the state goes to certiorari from postconviction from a postconviction loss on its side then the whole process is turned on its head and many many times this court has granted certiorari to the state and that is another problem that happens with this tolling if you read pending the way the state wants you to read pending because what do we do then what do people do 
 no but if the state is petitioning for cert it means you have won 
 it means you have won 
 so presumably you are not looking forward to further 
 no but what happens to the time how do you count that time if you lose here 
 i suppose youd have to file a protective petition with the district court saying we won but we might still lose 
 i guess and you know a protective to litigants protective and to district court judges i believe and state court judges protective petitions are kind of anathema because since you dont know what you are going to raise and in the N you have more of an idea certainly because you are limited in many instances if not all instances to those things which were exhausted but obviously there are new claims that are brought up because there would not be a stay and abey there would not even be a request for stay and abey if there were things that the federal courts find 
 assuming you make the same argument you make on questions N and N about the availability of equitable tolling 
 im sorry i didnt 
 i would be very surprised if the court found you were out of time because the state had filed a petition for certiorari 
 id be surprised 
 and have it granted 
 id be surprised too but i have practiced a long time and i have seen some very odd things happen in courts and both a stay and abey and the other procedures that have been discussed by this court have not been handed down as mandates to the lower court to require the lower court to rule in a certain way or to absolutely stay or to entertain protective motions and then permit those protective motions to be supplemented at a time later if your honors do not mind i will reserve some time 
 thank you counsel mr kise 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court petitioners case amounts to no more than a disagreement with aedpas recognized policies and procedures and an improper attempt to convert ignorance of settled law into an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable relief aedpas plain language and recognized purpose is established that tolling does not extend to the postconviction certiorari process additionally ignorance of settled law whether by an incarcerated pro se petitioner by private counsel or by appointed counsel is not an extraordinary circumstance and does not excuse prompt filing 
 mr kise can i ask you what your view in this matter would be if the court grants certiorari would the application be pending during the period that the case is under advisement in this court 
 no your honor and im assuming your question is asking me grant certiorari based on an application filed by the petitioner 
 either way 
 well in both circumstances the answer would be no and in both circumstances i think the relief that would be accorded 
 let me ask a second question suppose it were reversed we send it back for further proceedings in the state trial court would you say that its still not pending during the further proceedings 
 it may be pending in state court during the further proceedings but its not pending during the time that it is at this court because this court has not 
 so it started pending again after an interruption is that the way it would be 
 based on equitable principles i think that would be the interpretation yes your honor 
 forget about equitable principles statutory principles is there a lack of continuity where you could have it pending for a period of a couple years and then an interruption and then it can resume pending after the interruption 
 you are using the phraseology interruption and i would would 
 well period when its not pending followed by a period when it begins to pend 
 in that unusual circumstance your honor i think principles of equitable tolling would apply to keep the petitioners ability to file 
 but there would be no statutory right in your view it would depend on the equitable considerations 
 i believe thats correct your honor because statutory pending contemplates a finality it contemplates and i think that this is it is one of the fundamental problems i believe with petitioners construction is this ignoring of not only the plain language of the statute but what this court has said about this statute about N in duncan this court said that state the word state modifies both postconviction and other collateral review and established that we are talking about a state application 
 but it doesnt say state pending or pending in state court and what i want to do is go back and ask a question somewhat along the lines that justice stevens asked is the application pending in the period between the disposition of the petition by the state trial court and the determination by the petitioner whether or not to go forward for state appellate relief 
 yes your honor i believe it is and i believe thats what this court said 
 by the same token why isnt it pending between the final disposition by the state appellate court and the determination to seek cert here 
 well i have two answers to that your honor first would be thats inconsistent with the language utilized by this court in carey where the court defined pending as until final resolution through the states postconviction 
 that was the issue in that case this issue wasnt in that case 
 correct your honor but the language utilized nevertheless 
 i cant when i write something i dont think i or anyone else can if it happens to be a state case refrain from using the word state i wouldnt say there is an implication in writing an opinion that it doesnt mean federal as well as least i cant find that written in the opinion anywhere 
 fair enough your honor then with respect to the second part of my answer to your question justice souter that it cannot be both final for N purposes and pending 
 but why isnt your sisters answer to that adequate it is the state judgment that is final but action on the petition is not yet final until it has gone through the period allowed for final review by this court 
 i would i would respectfully disagree with that with that nondistinction if you will your honor in the sense that the application 
 so you are distinguishing between a state judgment and an application upon which further further proceedings can be had why is that a nondistinction 
 because i would i would disagree with the notion that further proceedings could be had on that application the basis for this courts certiorari of jurisdiction is that it is subject to no further review or correction in any state 
 lets assume that the the petition for cert is granted and this court grants relief the relief as i understand it is going to consist of a remand to the state court saying you did something wrong on this application before go back and do it over again and do it right its the it is the state application which is going to be the subject of it and that therefore it is the state application that necessarily is the subject of the cert petition 
 i would say your honor that the state application may be the subject matter of what you are looking at from a subject matter standpoint but what the court is ruling on is the petition for certiorari which was a federal court ruling on 
 its a petition for certiorari to review action taken on a state petition just as at the state level whatever may be the the nomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial court to the state appellate court is an application which relates entirely to the original application for relief that was filed in the state trial court it seems to me the two situations are exactly parallel 
 and i would respectfully disagree your honor because i dont see how it can be final for N purposes and still pending for purposes of the statute 
 but that that 
 its the application that is not subject to review we review the state court judgment not the state application correct 
 in this case your honor the application is the state court i mean the judgment is what is being reviewed and it is a final judgment in the application the florida supreme court in this case has no power at all once they have issued the mandate to go back and modify to correct it six months later if the florida supreme court decided you know we made a mistake in that application they dont have the power sua sponte to correct it it is final it is over the states province has been completed 
 but they would correct it if we told them to 
 in that circumstance yes your honor certainly they would in a circumstance in the very unusual circumstance where this court were to accept certiorari and then subsequent to the acceptance of certiorari then reverse the ruling 
 and when it got back in the state supreme court they would still be working on the application that had been pending until the end of the proceedings down there and then suddenly came back to life after we sent it back 
 yes your honor but that is again the extraordinary circumstance and that i think points out the one of the flaws in petitioners argument and that is that thats making the exception the rule that clearly congress did not intend to add what i believe chief justice roberts alluded to earlier an extra three months an extra six months 
 i think what you are saying though is when you have ambiguous language a sensible rule is not a rule it has to have a lot of exceptions to make sense surely thats a sound principle isnt it 
 yes your honor and i dont think that this would be a lot of exceptions i think this would be the only exception would be to the rule that we are advocating would be in the unusual circumstance the one in N cases the one in N cases the exceptional case where this court actually grants certiorari those cases are exceptional in and of themselves 
 those are the most likely where people are going to get mixed up i mean im not following i think i think this argument about the word is metaphysical you know and i can make wonderful arguments and you have made wonderful arguments on both sides of this i just cant get a clear answer so if i were right about that and there is no clear answer from the language then the thing id like to go back to justice stevens question because it seems to me that that puts my greatest concern my greatest concerns are practical if we take your position we have words right next to each other near each other in the same statutory provision meaning different things and i have learned out of my own experience perhaps judges and lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up and they will get mixed up all the time and when they get mixed up people will lose rights that they have the second concern of justice stevens which is what happens in the case and those are the ones who intuitively are going to cause the problem because on a rare occasion the state or the prisoner has a very good supreme court case and thats going to be the case where he forgets to file in the federal court because he thinks this thing isnt over and lo and behold the court grants it and now what happens on your interpretation i just see a mess and on the other interpretation it seems to work out fine so those i would say are the two practical problems and anything you would like to say about that id like to listen to 
 thank you justice breyer and i would respectfully answer your question i think in three ways first drawing a distinction between when the state petitions for certiorari and when the habeas petitioner petitions for certiorari under both circumstances equitable principles would apply but they would apply in i think different ways but in either circumstance the ability of the petitioner to subsequently seek habeas review would be protected and so what we are advocating is not making those exceptional cases the rule in a case where the state petitions for certiorari there isnt an ability there is no way to even file a protective habeas because there is nothing to file you have won the habeas petitioner has won in the court below there is no cause of action there isnt a basis upon which to file a federal habeas claim so even a protective one would be it wouldnt be premature it would be effectively nonexistent so from an equitable standpoint the extraordinary circumstance which the courts have recognized the circuits have recognized that the test for equitable circumstance is the extraordinary circumstance would be this court accepting certiorari and then the exercise of diligence on the part of the petitioner is if the petitioner did everything he or she could under that circumstance because there would be no way for that petitioner to file for a federal habeas review because there would be no basis for it 
 can i ask it seems very strange to me i can understand protective filings when you have lost but it seems to me a very strange protective filing when you have won in state court and the government has taken certiorari can you file file in federal district court what do you say what are you complaining about 
 exactly my point your honor you cannot 
 no its their point i dont see how its your point how can you cover yourself i mean if we come out your way how how 
 there isnt a need to cover us up your honor because you have won in state court 
 provided equitable 
 you are worried about winning in the supreme court 
 in the one in N or one in N cases equitable principles would then apply the distinction may not be clear between statutory tolling what the statute actually provides for and equitable tolling equitable principles that have been applied by the court 
 but you are asking us to say that the congress has written a statute which doesnt take account that the state might sometimes file a petition for certiorari that would be granted and you say oh thats so rare thats so extraordinary it happens its part of the system 
 would you advise a client that way would you advise a client that way 
 well 
 you have won here and the state is taking certiorari to the supreme court dont worry about making a protective filing in the district court because you know if by chance the supreme court reverses equitable tolling will apply you know you roll the dice with equity 
 i dont think there would be i think it would be ill advised to to direct a petitioner to file in federal court under those circumstances because there would be nothing to file what would be the complaint 
 i agree 
 there would be absolutely nothing to file 
 the irony of your position is that it has those harshest consequences in those rare cases where there was a denial of constitutional right 
 your honor i would respectfully disagree that it has its harshest consequences because thats where the equitable tolling principles would in fact apply 
 why do you need equitable tolling why cant you use why isnt it most sensible to use the model when for the time clock on direct appeal say there has been a conviction affirmed by the highest court of the state when does the time when does that judgment its a final judgment if you seek cert right but the time clock the one year doesnt begin to run until after the N days has elapsed isnt that right 
 yes your honor 
 so why shouldnt it be the same way for collateral review as it is for direct review direct review everyone agrees that you get the state final judgment but then you have N days and nothing starts until that N days is up or if cert is granted until the cert process is done why shouldnt it be just the same for collateral review 
 i would say its different your honor respectfully for two reasons one because this court has said that direct review is different in numerous cases and two because the statute makes that distinction congress in utilized that very specific language that included the the certiorari period and in did not use that language and it is the absence of that language that indicates that tolling is only to apply while a petitioner is exhausting relief state relief 
 well that means that means that if a petitioner who has had his state application for collateral relief denied wants to petition this court but doesnt want to lose out on the possibility of seeking federal habeas that prisoner has to do two things at the same time one prepare a petition for cert and the other is to prepare prepare a complaint to file in a federal district court thats a lot to put on a person particularly the one who isnt represented 
 well your honor i would say that in many circumstances that would be the case but not always the case it depends on how much time is left on the federal statute of limitations how much time is remaining how long did it take to get through the state postconviction process how timely was the filing in the state post conviction process and how much time is remaining assuming for what was discussed 
 here there were N days right 
 then they would need to file yes your honor and they would need to 
 theyd have to file a federal court complaint and a cert petition within the N days 
 yes your honor yes your honor because the amount of time that would elapse before this court were to rule on the cert petition would consume that N days and i dont think thats inconsistent with what congress intended here because what congress intended by this provision was to provide petitioner well what this court said in duncan what this court has recognized is that the scheme that has been put together here by congress is one which encourages petitioners first to file and exhaust their state remedies recognizing and giving deference to the principles of comity and then second to file once they are done with their state process once they have completed the state process and exhausted their state remedies to file their federal habeas in the words of this court in duncan as soon as possible and the anomaly that would be created by petitioners construction would be it would be the only time under all of aedpa where a petitioner could file in federal district court but isnt required to file and so i would submit to this court that it cannot be both exhausted and pending at the same time it would not fit within the scheme that this court has already determined the structure of is designed to accomplish the principle is that you are to as a habeas petitioner go quickly to state court and we are going to give state courts the first opportunity at these federal constitutional questions and yes justice stevens it may take some time it may take several years in federal in state court before they accomplish that purpose but thats the states issue because its the states judgment and the state is taking its time and it shouldnt be and this is what congress recognized i think in that that that the petitioner should not be penalized for that time thats why it was tolled 
 is it is it clear that he can go to district i mean im not familiar with how these things work is it possible that when there is an appeal or certiorari pending here there can be proceeding in district court a habeas action on the same on the same matter that we are considering on certiorari 
 yes your honor i believe there can i believe there is in fact 
 district courts do that i mean they would be considering the same the same issues we are i suppose 
 well i dont know that they would be considering the exact same issues your honor and there are many things that can be done petitioner 
 you are sure that happens that while cert is pending here there is a habeas proceeding ongoing in district court 
 well i certainly hope that in the N of the N circuits that have agreed with floridas position here that that is happening because if not then they are at risk depending on how 
 wouldnt a district judge who knows that theres a cert petition pending just say well i will wait this petition will be held pending the supreme courts disposition of cert 
 i would respectfully say to your honor that its not an automatic stay i mean perhaps there would be a stay at some point but there are things that can be accomplished in federal court before the undertaking of the review there is the rule N screening process in habeas there is the initial review by the district court to see if the filing itself meets the procedural requirements there is the asking for an answer by the state there is discovery that can take place all of this can take place while the cert petition is pending before the federal district undertakes any review of the merits now if there gets to be this juxtaposition where it looks like there is going to be a conflict between the federal districts courts review of the substantive merits and that is going to conflict with this courts certiorari review well then i think a stay would be implemented 
 well i will accept your view as being the personal experience im rather surprised that district courts would go through all of these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and they may not have to 
 well they may not have to 
 im not sure if i would tell the district courts thats what they ought to do is a wise expenditure of resources i will think about that 
 well i mean it sort of depends on how often cert is going to be granted doesnt it if you are a district court and you have hundreds of these habeas petitions being filed you can either hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed one in one thousand or whatever the number is because they might be granted i think youd probably take your chances depending on the petition if it looks serious and theres a petition pending you dont have to proceed if its frivolous perhaps you can proceed 
 i think thats exactly right your honor i think thats really the point and you have obviously articulated it better than i did in my previous answer but thats exactly right that 
 but isnt it true the real problem with the capital cases the states interest in getting things moving is the strongest in the capital cases i think 
 absolutely your honor 
 in the noncapital cases there is an interest in promptness but the longer the guy stays in jail is not going to prejudice the state but you do want to get your death cases terminated as soon as you can and what we are really talking about as i understand it is whether in most death cases we will add on a period of six eight nine months to the total period and in most of those death cases which is a limited number i dont know you have a couple hundred people i suppose in death row in those cases its going to be seven eight nine years anyway 
 well it may be that long it may be a shorter period but i think what we need to look at is not what we would think would be the preferred time frame but what congress said was the preferred time frame and congress is saying that its one year and the only time its tolled is when the petitioner is doing what it should be doing to exhaust state remedies thats again what this court said in duncan about describing this entire structure 
 thats if you are formally right on the metaphysical question but if you are not now thinking you just gave a response to the chief justice that said well really the federal district judge when he gets these things just has to look at them and then he figures out whether he is going to stay it or whether hes going to proceed on some issues or whether he is going to do something else and thats what you thought was fairly easy you have the experience there and i just wonder how easy it is i mean why wouldnt it be easy because i guess before doing anything the judge has to know what this thing is about and thats where it seems to me to take the time of a district judge they have many many petitions sometimes they are well organized sometimes not he sends them to a magistrate possibly the magistrate has a lot to do and the time consumed is the time finding out what is this case about is that fair characterization or not how easy is it 
 i think its partly fair your honor what i would say is the time certain time is consumed just determining whether or not under the rule N screening process whether or not the petition meets the formal requirements whether they have articulated the claim in the correct way and whether its worthy of the state response if theres discovery that needs to be had i mean all of these things can be taking place and in the one in one thousand or perhaps more than that and i dont pretend to have the exact number or the statistics but in the very very usual circumstance where cert is actually granted i think then a stay could be put in place and i dont think its fair to say respectfully that congress intended to forestall this entire process while this court undertakes certiorari review 
 mr kise there are two applications your answer to the petitioner is you have to file in the federal court within that N days if a prisoner says i cant manage a cert petition and a federal habeas corpus its hard enough for me to get any assistance so i will have to pick one or the other isnt the the reading of an ambiguous statute that you are proposing going to be an incentive or a disincentive to filing both which the prisoner has a right to do he is going to have to pick one or the other if he is in this timeline 
 well respectfully your honor and i know that that is the petitioners argument and i see that you have given me that question but i dont know that it is that much of a choice i mean i think that they can file they can file both in those circumstances and and depending on the particular circumstances and this is back to the equitable tolling principles for statutory tolling purposes i think the answer is they must file both or they forfeit the right to one or the other if they choose not to file for cert then they voluntarily if they pass the N days forfeited that right and if they dont file within the statutory period then they have under aedpa missed the statute of limitations deadline but i would i submit to you that it is possible to do both and in circumstances where there is some impediment to them doing just that if they exercise diligence if they are doing everything they possibly can and it is not possible to file both at the same time well then i think under the facts of the proper scenario that equitable principles might apply but again to say that congress built into the system this automatic time period thats going to be tacked on to a very short oneyear statute of limitations a statute of limitations that is designed to really move things through the system rapidly is respectfully i dont think the correct interpretation of the language and i dont think it is consistent with what this court said in duncan or with respect to justice breyer what this court said in carey 
 let me be clear on your answer to justice stevens earlier question where there is a reversal of the state judgment by by this court and the case is remanded to the state you dont argue that what occurs then is equitable tolling but you say that the case is again pending once it goes back to the state is that right 
 i think once its back in the state system then it would have to be considered pending because the statute contemplates that while its part of the state process it would be pending if the court has no further questions thank you 
 thank you mr kise ms bonner you have four minutes remaining 
 thank you sir i have heard the state over these many years say that a simple exception will help the defendant and dont worry we will not proceed we will ask for dont worry we wont object kind of what we are getting here is we wont be objecting to a stay if there is a stay requested however they objected to the stay here that the united states district court entered in an exercise of honesty he said im going to wait for the supreme court to decide what happens in artuz whether they accept cert or not and they vigorously objected and utilized a good little built of time litigating it on an interlocutory type appeal one of the practical problems is if this case is in both courts this one and the united states district court where is the record is its just the most practical of things and also where is the lawyer who is the lawyer 
 records dont have to typically are not filed with the petition for cert so the record would be back in the lower court 
 so that solves that the 
 just to be clear it is your position that to get you think everyones entitled to the additional N days whether they file or not 
 yes i do 
 to get the additional time for an opposition that would be considered here you have to file the petition for cert in other words if you dont file after the N th day its no longer pending 
 absolutely 
 okay so then why wouldnt the result of your position be that every person who is denied state postconviction relief is going to file a cert position to get the additional time 
 why is my position that they would not 
 wouldnt that lead to that result if congress was concerned that people were stringing out the time before they seek habeas one way to string it out under your reading but not under the states reading would be to file a petition for cert 
 well congress couldnt have been too concerned about that N days because it certainly permitted the trigger to have the N days included within it and this court has allowed the N days 
 im sorry whats the trigger 
 a N 
 yes when they wanted to include the N days they said the expiration of the time for seeking review they did not say that in 
 they did not say that but they said while the application is pending and the state did not address for this court what is pending here if its not that application from state court 
 does your argument 
 i guess you could also say that except in capital cases the defendant will not have an incentive to delay he wants to get out right 
 of course of course and you know frankly i think all of the defendants on death row 
 i mean if the defendant had no incentive to delay why did congress think it necessary to impose the statue of limitations they did that because they thought people were stringing out their and they were applying for federal habeas after too long of a delay 
 well strangely enough in this case i was looking at statistics as to the average length of time that a case was pending before between conviction and the filing of the N and mr lawrences petition was filed within days of what the average was before the aedpa that comes up in a statistical analysis i believe by the department of justice cited to by the state 
 doesnt the title of a statute indicate the category of cases that congress was primarily interested in 
 oh yes 
 the death penalty 
 oh yes when they joined together in antiterrorism effective the just the word effective was plenty to convey to us what they actually mean the other big problem thats not been addressed is these people in a practical sense do not have the same lawyer for both proceedings many people who were more than willing to practice in state court are not willing to practice in federal court its a more formalized rigorous endeavor and in this case what happened was mr lawrence had a lawyer who practiced in the state and obviously must have prepared for him that initial place holder if you want to call it N because its typewritten they cite to a westlaw site i dont think there is any way that anyone can contemplate that that would be mr lawrences doing in his own right also whether its N days or six months as your honor has said its always in the control of this court once the N this is not a frolic of unnumbered years when someone files a petition he either files it by the time N days is over or he is out of court or he files it and this court is quickly reviewing it after some input from the other side 
 thank you miss bonner 
 thank you 
 the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first today in N parents involved in community schools versus seattle school district number N mr korrell 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in an effort to achieve its desired racial balance in its popular high schools the seattle school district denied over N children both white and minority children admission to their chosen schools solely because of their race and without any individualized consideration this strikes at the heart of the equal protection clause which commands that government treat people as individuals not simply as members of a racial class this fundamental equal protection principle was reiterated in grutter and in gratz the central question in this case is not as the school district and many of its allies suggest whether integration is important or whether desegregation is compelling the central question in this case is whether outside of the remedial context diversity defined as the school district does as a white or nonwhite racial balance can be a compelling interest that justifies the use of race discrimination in high school admissions 
 mr korrell 
 do you disagree in general with the solicitor generals brief do you agree in general with the brief submitted by the government or do you have differences with it in its approach 
 justice kennedy we we agree mostly with the solicitor generals brief i believe the solicitor general might take a different position on whether race neutral mechanisms can be used to accomplish race specific purposes 
 well i can 
 but thats not an issue the court needs to reach in this case 
 well it it is a point that i id like both him and you to discuss at some point during your argument if can you use race for site selection when you have you need to build a new school there are three sites one of them would be all one race site two would be all the other race site three would be a diversity of races can the school board with with the intent to have diversity pick site number N 
 justice kennedy i think the answer turns on the reason that the schools have the racial compositions that they do 
 it theres well we can have all kinds of different hypotheticals but theres residential housing segregation and it wants it wants the board wants to have diversity 
 your honor our position is that if if the resulting if the racial composition of those schools is not the result of past de jure segregation 
 no it is a new school its a new school 
 in that case your honor parents position is that the government cant be in the position of deciding what right racial mix is 
 so itd have to take the three sites all of them in the hypothetical all of them equal and just flip a coin because otherwise it would be using a 
 your honor obviously it is not the facts of the seattle case in the hypothetical your honor posits perhaps the right analogy is something similar to the a redistricting cases where a court could look at see whether the racial motive was a predominant factor as opposed to 
 no no the school board says we want right up front we want racial diversity in our new schools illicit under the fourteenth amendment in your case 
 your honor school districts can do many many things through race neutral means that they could not do with race discrimination 
 but can they have a race conscious objective i think that thats the question that justice kennedy is asking you and i dont get a clear answer you say you cant use a racial means but can you have a racial objective that is you want to achieve balance in the schools 
 justice ginsburg our position is that that is prohibited by the constitution absent past discrimination 
 you would object then to magnet schools you would object to any system that is designed to try to cause people voluntarily to go into a system that is more racially mixed 
 justice scalia our objection to the seattle program is that it is not a race neutral means 
 no i understand but im trying to find what you know the outer limits of your contentions are it doesnt seem to me that your briefs indicated that you would object to something like magnet schools the even if one of the purposes of those schools is to try to cause more white students to go to schools that are predominantly nonwhite its just voluntary i mean but the object is to achieve a greater racial mix 
 your honor we object to the if thats the sole goal of a school district absent past discrimination we object but that kind of hypothetical situation isnt even necessary for the court to reach 
 i understand 
 well it may not be necessary for you but it might be necessary for us when we write the case we are not writing just on a very factspecific issue of course the followup question and the solicitor general can address it too is this assuming some raceconscious measures are permissible to have diversity isnt it odd to say you cant use race as a means i mean thats the next question that may in fact be why you give the seem to give the answer that you do you just dont want to embrace that contradiction 
 your honor it is certainly difficult if race if racial balance can be a goal of government then it is more difficult to defend a racial balancing plan as unconstitutional or to attack one as constitutional 
 that is true 
 and this court has said repeatedly that racial balancing is unconstitutional 
 well we have said it repeatedly in contexts different from this i mean the paradigm context in which we made remarks to that effect stated that are affirmative action cases the point of the affirmative action case is that some criterion which otherwise would be the appropriate criterion of selection is being displaced by a racial mix criterion that is not what is happening here this is not an affirmative action case so why should the statements that have been made in these entirely different contexts necessarily decide this case 
 justice souter we disagree that the analysis in the grutter and gratz cases is entirely different from the analysis in this case 
 but dont you agree that those cases left someone out of the picture entirely because we were talking about a selection of one person or another the word sorting has been used in this context because everybody gets to go to school indeed they are required to go to school so no one gets left out of the system and i think there have been court of appeals judges who have noted we have never had that case before not like the affirmative action cases 
 your honor i agree that this court has not had a case like this before i disagree however that its not like the grutter or gratz decision the plaintiff in gratz as the court is aware attended the university of michigan at dearborn he got into a school he didnt get into the school that he wanted to go to similarly in our case with the plaintiffs they wanted to go to their preferred schools schools that the school district acknowledges provided different educational opportunities produced different educational outcomes and they were preferable to the parents and children who wanted to go 
 why do you agree that this is not an affirmative action case is it not wherein does it differ i thought that the school district was selecting some people because they wanted a certain racial mix in the schools and were taking the affirmative action of giving a preference to students of a certain race why isnt why doesnt that qualify as affirmative action 
 if thats what affirmative action is your honor then 
 well i dont know what else it is what do you think it is that causes you to seemingly accept the characterization that this is not it 
 your honor perhaps i misspoke i didnt mean to accept the characterization that this case is not at all 
 let me help you out by taking you back to my question one of the characteristics of the affirmative action cases was the displacement of some other otherwise generally acknowledged relevant criterion such as ability as shown in test scores grade point averages things like that and that was a characteristic of those cases it is not a characteristic of this case as i understand it 
 im not sure thats exactly right your honor in this case the school district admitted in the response to request for admissions that had the identified children been of a different race they would have been admitted into the schools 
 i thought there was a criterion here and that is you can go to whatever school you want you are allowed to go to a certain choice of school the criterion was your choice 
 justice scalia you are right and theres another criterion which i think is getting to justice 
 well when you state justice scalia is right you are assuming i think as your brief assumed that the definition of the benefit to be received here is the active choice not the provision of an education now the active choice may be of value i do not suggest that it is not clearly the school district thinks it does or it wouldnt provide choice but it is not the entire benefit that is being provided and the principal benefit is the education not the choice of schools isnt that correct 
 your honor they are both benefits i would point your honor back to this courts decision in gratz where the same analysis would apply and if your honors analysis is correct that would mean i think that the gratz case would have been decided differently 
 but i think that the point that justice souter is trying to make as i understand it is of course there are similarities to gratz they can choose but theres a big difference the similarity in grutter or the difference in grutter and gratz is that you had to prod a school that was supposed to be better than others that the members of that school the faculty and the administration tried to make it better than others it was an elite merit selection academy and if you put the black person in the white person cant get the benefit of that here we have no merit selection system merit is not an issue the object of the people who run this place is not to create a school better than others it is to equalize the schools thats in principle and in practice if you look at the numbers you see that the six schools that were at the top their position would shift radically from year to year preferences was about equal among them they have the same curriculum they have similar faculties and i dont think anyone can say either in theory or in practice that one of these schools happened to be like that prize of university of michigan a merit selection system that i think was a major difference that he was getting at why is this not the same kind of thing that was at issue in grutter and gratz now what is your response to that 
 your honor we have several responses the first is that the premise of your honors question is that the schools are in essence fungible for purposes of providing a high school education and i would direct your honor to the district court judges decision a footnote in the decision in which she acknowledged that the schools were not of equal quality that they provided different levels of education 
 of course they are not thats why some of them were oversubscribed thats why others were undersubscribed 
 i didnt say that they were what i said was that the object of the school board and the administering authority was to make them roughly equal i said that in terms of curriculum and faculty they are about roughly equal and in terms of choice what you see is a wide variation in choice by those who want to go as to which is their preference among six schools over a period of five years and that suggests a rough effort to create the equality not an effort as in michigan to run a merit selection system 
 i agree with your honor that theres not a merit selection system in 
 fine now the question is why doesnt that fact that this is not a merit selection system put a different kind of thing a sorting system or a system designed to maintain a degree of integration why doesnt that difference make a difference 
 your honor i think that the fundamental command of the equal protection clause is that government treats as individuals not as members of a racial group and that command i dont think is suspended because of the nature of a schools admissions process that right is still possessed by the individual students and if a student is entitled to be treated as an individual as opposed to a member of a racial group at a university level its parents position they are entitled to that same protection at the high school level 
 mr korrell before your time runs out i did want to clarify something about the standing of the plaintiffs here do i understand correctly that none of the parents who originally brought this lawsuit have children who are now preninth grade but that newcomers people who recently joined do have children of preninth grade age 
 your honor that is mostly correct there is also a family that joined the parents association back in N that has a child in seventh grade that will be approaching high school by the time this court decides the case 
 but the lawsuit was originally brought by a corporate entity correct 
 thats correct your honor 
 not by individual parents 
 thats correct 
 but you dont dispute that membership for standing purposes the membership is what counts not the association but the members 
 your honor my understanding of the courts jurisprudence on associational standing is as long as a member of the association has standing then the association has it we submit that that has been established by the complaint the interrogatory responses and 
 well if it is a member jurisdictional questions generally dont we go by what the membership was when the complaint was filed and not what it has become in the course of the litigation 
 i dont think thats right your honor we cited to the court the pannell case the associated general contractors case and roe versus wade all of which look at postfiling factors to 
 yes but the transaction case situation is different 
 you are right your honor none of those were class action cases pannell and associated general contractors were association cases much like this one roe of course was individual plaintiffs 
 i have a question does the record tell us the N people who have failed to get into the schools they wanted the racial composition of that group 
 it does justice stevens the record shows that N roughly N students who were denied admission to their preferred schools were nonwhite and roughly N who were denied admission were white students if there are no further questions mr chief justice i will reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you counsel general clement 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court respondents assert an interest in addressing the most racially isolated schools in the district yet their plan does not address the two most racially concentrated high schools in their district they likewise have certain interests in diversity yet their plan does not directly address diversity other than pure racial diversity and they do nothing to assemble the kind of critical mass that was at issue in the grutter case in fact if you look at the program and how it operates in practice the triggering critical mass for the use of the racial tie breaker is when a student when a school has less than N percent white students or when it has less than N percent nonwhite students there is nothing in the record or in social science that suggests that theres a radical difference in the critical mass based on the race of the students of course what explains that difference in the triggering critical mass of white students versus nonwhite students the answer to that does not lie in educational theory the answer lies in the demographics of the district the district happens to have N percent more nonwhite students than white students so they trigger the race tie breaker at a different point under those circumstances with all respect to respondents the answer to how this program works lies not in diversity but in demographics they are clearly working backwards from the overall demographics of the school district rather than working forward to any clearly articulated pedagogical role 
 counsel if i could get back to justice kennedys question earlier how do you distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools clustering from the consideration of race in this case 
 well mr chief justice i think that those decisions are different primarily because the resulting decision is not a racial classification and if you think about it when you had an overt racial classification like you clearly do in these cases then you naturally ask the strict scrutiny questions and look for a compelling interest if instead you start with a raceneutral government action that doesnt classify people directly based on race then i suppose you could try to do some kind of arlington heightswashington davis type analysis 
 well what would you do with strategic site selection in order to create racial diversity 
 well justice kennedy i think 
 i mean thats expressed and principal purpose you know the hypothetical 
 okay and justice kennedy i will answer the hypo but let me say its easy for purposes of the hypo to say the sole reason was for race in the real world in fact i cant imagine that a site decision wont be based at least in part on concerns about the overall educational benefits and i think thats important the reason i start with that preface is because when you have mixed motives and a variety of factors i think youd be unlikely to strike down that kind of motive 
 are you suggesting there was no consideration of overall educational benefits in this plan 
 no justice stevens im saying you start at a different departure point when you have an express racial classification i think im trying to answer justice kennedys question about what if you have a sort of a raceconscious goal at some level and thats why you select a particular site or you decide that you are going to invest in magnet schools and want to put a magnet school in a particular school district my humble point is simply that in the real world i think you are unlikely to have the pure racial motive type objective i would say that 
 suppose it was faculty and the school district makes a deliberate effort to have members of the white race and members of other races represented in on the faculty of every school so you wont have one school with all white teachers so that you will have a mix and thats quite explicit thats their objective and they are using a racial criterion criterion to get there would that be impermissible to have a mix of teachers in all the schools 
 well justice ginsburg i think if what they wanted to do is have an mix of teachers that might be okay if they are going to start assigning teachers to particular schools and have sort of racial quotas for the faculty at various schools i think that crosses a line 
 well what would be okay how would you get there other than having the point im trying to make has been made by others let me read from judge boudins decision he says the choice is between openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through some clumsy or proxy device if you want to have an integrated school and you site the schools deliberately to achieve that objective its very hard for me to see how you can have a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there 
 well with respect justice ginsburg i think theres a fundamental difference between how the same intent with two programs theres a fundamental difference if one of them necessarily classifies people on the basis of their skin color and the other does not 
 general clement is there anything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of the races and establishing policies which achieve that result but which do not single out individuals and disqualify them for certain things because of their race is there anything wrong with a policy of wanting to have racial mix 
 justice scalia we would take the position that theres not and that theres a fundamental difference between whether or not the policy manages to avoid classifying people on the basis of their race 
 at page N of your brief you say school districts have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation if i put a period in there then i would get to my strategic site selection and i still havent got your answer on that you dont put a period there you say have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation through raceneutral means and this brings up this same question justice ginsburg had isnt it odd jurisprudence where we have an objective that we state in one set of terms but a means for achieving it in another set of terms unless your answer is that individual classification by race is is impermissible but other more broad measures based on with a racial purpose are all right 
 i think thats ultimately the answer justice kennedy which is theres a fundamental difference between classifying people and having the real world effect i mean in this case dont forget that there were N minority students that wanted to attend franklin high school they could not solely because of their race at the same time every white student who applied to franklin high school was allowed in solely base would on their race 
 and what is the answer to my strategic site selection hypothetical 
 we would say thats fine we would say that that is permissible for the school to pursue that just to get back though again we say that that avoiding racial isolation is i just want to make the point we say that racial isolation is an important government interest i think if you put this plan up against that objective it solely fails because there are two high schools that i think you would look at as being racially isolated they are cleveland n rainier beach and this plan does nothing to directly address those high schools 
 my question is really judge boudins question you are in effect saying that by siting the school they can achieve exactly the objective they are seeking here its a question of do the the question comes down to whether they can do it candidly or do it by clumsier that is it seems to me an unacceptable basis to draw a constitutional line 
 with respect justice souter first of all i think the kind of interests we are talking about avoiding racial isolation and the like do not lend themselves to absolutely targeted it has to be N percent it has to be N it has to be N it has to be N i would actually suggest that the danger is in the opposite direction 
 that isnt what they said here i mean they were dealing with a zone within which they operated and it was only when the numbers got to the outer limits that they said okay we are going to use a racial criterion to prevent anything more any more extreme disparity 
 well i mean in the second stage 
 thats what they do when they site the school they said you know we will get a rough whatever it is N mix 
 well i think in the second case you will see that you know the same logic that leads to this leads itself to stricter bands but let me say i would have thought the analysis would run the exact opposite way and i would think that if you got to the point which the ninth circuit did on page N a of its opinion where it says you know with this objective that we have allowed the most narrowly tailored way to get there is to expressly use race i would have thought that might have suggested there was something wrong with the compelling interest if thats the way 
 while you are talking about the way let me ask a practical question N years ago in swann this court said that a school board particularly an elected one it didnt say that could well conclude that to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of negro to white students reflecting the proportion of the district as a whole far more radical than anything thats at issue here then it adds to do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities thats what this court said N years ago thousands of school districts across the country we are told have relied on that statement in an opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration you can answer this in the next case if you want so think about it 
 you can answer in this case general 
 my question of course is simply this when you have thousands of school districts relying on this to get a degree of integration in the united states of america what are you telling this court is going to happen when we start suddenly making departing from the case do you want us to overrule it why why practically 
 general 
 if i could answer the question i think that the fact that you point to the specific language of swann is helpful because the court there in dictum i think everybody would agrees that was dictum said that you could achieve a prescribed ratio and thats exactly where the logic of the other side of the ninth circuit of judge boudin with all respect thats where it takes you and i think anybody that relied on that language in the wake of cases like crosson in the wake of freeman against pitts that said achieving a racial balance for its own sake is not constitutional and bakke and grutter against gratz that all said that racial balancing is verboten i think those school districts would have been misguided in relying on that language thank you 
 thank you general mr madden 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court when seattle was last before this court you struck down a state law that prevented bussing for integration purposes because that law prevented the school board from seeking to provide the educational benefits of integrated schools at that time you said it was clear enough that all children benefit from exposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom by preparing them for citizenship in our pluralistic society and teaching them to live in harmony and mutual respect 
 mr madden thats certainly an admirable goal could a local unit a municipality or even a state have another goal lets say what used to be great about the united states was the presence of various ethnic groups i mean there were the pennsylvania dutch there were the amish there were little italys there were chinatowns and these things are beginning to disappear and we think that we should encourage the continuation of that diversity as the federal government has done with respect to american indian tribes and therefore we are going to use public funds for such things as street festivals a chinatown street festival an italian street festival we are going to encourage those organizations that maintain that separateness is there anything unconstitutional about that objective 
 providing funding for street festivals 
 about the objective i mean think we should foster separateness is there anything wrong 
 i think that in the context that you have described it that would be constitutionally very problematic 
 fine it would be problematic 
 yes 
 why 
 because i can conceive that its not unlike education where the goal is to educate the entire community and to help to prepare the community the students to live in that community its not a traditional role of government 
 well then let me change justice 
 please let me finish the line of questioning assume with me that it is not an unconstitutional objective which i am sure its not could the could the government achieve that objective by barring people from moving into little italy or giving a preference to some people to buy real estate in little italy if they are of italian ancestry could it do that absolutely not right 
 i would agree with you 
 so it would appear that even if the objective is okay you cannot achieve it by any means whatever and the mere fact that the objective of achieving a diverse balanced society is perfectly all right although certainly not the only objective in the world the mere fact that its okay doesnt mean you can achieve it by any means whatever 
 i would submit that theres a fundamental difference between the circumstances you have described and a school system which takes all comers and is tasked to educate them by preparing them to live in a pluralistic society 
 well my slight modification of justice scalias hypothetical and it proceeds on the same theory is suppose theres a huge demand for housing a developer has a plan to build N units can the city say we will grant you the permit on the ground on the condition that N percent of all the houses go to minorities that means people will live together then we can have a school a school that can be diverse 
 i would say not because housing decisions are inherently private unlike public education and theres no way to know how those benefits are being distributed if they are going to be comparable i would say no it is not comparable to the schools 
 well your system is the one that gives a choice to the individuals 
 it does and when there are more choices than there are seats available 
 does that make a difference what if you adopted a plan that insisted on a more or less rigid N ratio at every school and assignments were made on that basis it was not a followon to a choice system 
 well i think 
 would that be unconstitutional 
 excuse me mr chief justice im sorry to interrupt i think in each circumstance it depends on the status of the school system 
 the same the facts are otherwise the same except you conclude that private choice contributes to further division rather than integration and so the assignments are made on a N basis 
 i think that is roughly the circumstance that existed in the first seattle case mr chief justice and additionally i think that you then have to move into the realm of whats constitutionally permissible and can in a constitutionally permissible use of race a school system accommodate other values like choice and neighborhood ties and family connections to the school system 
 i still dont have your answer is strict assignment N without regard to choice constitutional or not 
 i i would want to know more about the system because i think strictly if theres nothing else and theres no flexibility i think it presents narrow tailoring problems 
 and how does this not present narrow tailoring problems if if the when you get to the fact of choice the sole criteria at that level is the same as would be the case in a N assignment 
 well we have accommodated choice to the extent there are seats available and then we go to family connections and then we in operation admit everyone who lives close to the school and then as to those that live further away we look to see whats the schools racial demographic is it significantly different than the communitys these schools we have talked about have been the objects of significantly more aggressive segregation efforts and the board wanted to preserve those 
 one of the one of the factors our prior cases looked to was whether the plan has a logical end point what is the logical end point in this plan 
 well the board actually at every turn reflected in the record discussed whether it was necessary to continue the use of race whether to narrow it and eventually to end it and i think it is in the joint appendix at N the superintendents testimony of the simultaneously the measures that the board was implementing in terms of resource allocation implementation of new programs because they realized that by diversifying choice they could hopefully achieve some of these same ends not as quickly not as efficiently but that they could achieve them thats been indeed the entire trajectory of seattles integration efforts since the first seattle plan 
 but in grutter we said to shorten it just a little bit at page N of the us reports N the law schools interest is not simply to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group because of race that would amount to outright racial balancing which is patently unconstitutional and that seems to be what you have here 
 i think that the term racial balancing has two significant meanings one is a plan that does not foster a compelling interest and second a plan that is too rigid a quota for instance that might not pass narrow tailoring given the context in this case we are not after a rigid set of numbers and certainly not after a rigid set of numbers for their own sake the purpose was to have schools that had become diverse through integration efforts not stray too far from the communitys demographic because we are trying to prepare students to live in those communities 
 the problem is that unlike strategic siting magnet schools special resources special programs in some schools you are characterizing each student by reason of the color of his or her skin that is quite a different means and it seems to me that that should only be if ever allowed allowed as a last resort 
 the board here was trying to distribute sort out seats that were available at these popular schools and so it devised a system whereby every student had the opportunity to be assigned to at least one of those popular schools and as far as the record shows in plaintiffs briefing theres no material differences between those those popular schools 
 do you have quotas for for racial hiring of your faculty in these schools 
 no 
 why not 
 i dont think the board has ever found that necessary to to achieve diversity in the faculty 
 justice kennedys question i think was is this basically a kind of last report or how close to a has resort is it whats the history of this i thought the history involved a lawsuit to desegregate the schools a much more rigid system of racial abuse of race ultimately you come to this now you stop this and what happened after you stopped it 
 what happened is that that it 
 well what is the history basically am i right 
 the history is that the board had both narrowed the use of the integration tie breaker in N and N and then continued it for the N school year we were in N school year we were enjoined in N to use it in that year which was considerably disruptive but the board was also the measures that it had implemented implementing magnet schools at rainier beach and chief south high schools in the south end implementing it in 
 but thats not what im thinking 
 im sorry 
 i mean im thinking that i thought as i read this and you have to correct me because you have a better knowledge originally the schools were highly segregated in fact people brought a lawsuit then to stop that seattle engaged in a plan that really bused people around on the basis of race that led to white flight that was bad for the schools they then tried a voluntary choice plan this is part of that plan then when they abandon this plan they discover more segregation is that basically right or not 
 when when this plan has this the description is yes basically right when this plan was suspended in after the court of appeals enjoined it the board had as i said experienced some considerable disruption in the assignments because of the timing of the injunction but the board was also looking at the effect of the raceneutral if you will program measures that it had implemented such that now ingram high school in the north end of seattle is much more popular nathan hale is no longer oversubscribed theres less demand for ballard but there have been 
 do you think your do you think your schools as they are operated now are segregated 
 we have some change of conditions but the basic conditions remain the trends has not been positive for example and i think that the petitioner picked 
 to say segregated segregated you refer to some of the schools as segregated and i thats not what i understand by segregated 
 not not in the sense 
 i mean you know if you belong to a country club that that that has N percent black members i would not consider that a segregated country club so what you are complaining about is is not segregation in any in any reasonable sense of the word you are complaining about a lack of racial balance 
 we are not complaining about segregation resulting from purposeful discrimination thats 
 thats the only meaning of segregation 
 i 
 you are talking about racial balance 
 talking about schools that are on the one end racially isolated the solicitor general mentioned two of those and talking on the other end about preserving the diversity that we had achieved through these years of effort in these north end schools 
 well i think you are also 
 justice alito and justice breyer and i myself am interested can you tell us what has happened since the plans been enjoined 
 yes 
 i mean have you gone back to square one and its just theres no diversity at all or is there substantially more diversity can you tell us about that because its important it may mean that you dont need to identify students by the color of their skin in assignment 
 it it may mean the board confronted with the circumstances might well make that decision independent of this litigation but let me answer the specific lets take franklin high school to begin with in in N that school was had N percent white enrollment in N it had N percent white enrollment in the ninth grade which is really the the level at which we see the effect of the segregation tie breaker in N the white enrollment was N percent it was N percent in N go to ballard high school on the other end ballard was N percent white students in N its N percent in N the ninth grade class has moved from N percent white students to N percent white students keeping in mind that that school is now significantly less popular than it was i think those effects would probably be be more extreme but the plan i want to emphasize the plan was to try to disperse demand and to foster choices that would result in diversity not to compel it we do not 
 how do how do you square your objective of achieving racial balance with your disinterest in the situation at cleveland and rainier beach those are the most unbalanced schools under your definition and yet those are not affected at all by this plan why why are you not concerned about that 
 well they are affected by the plan in this in this way that in the past the district had used mandatory measures busing students across town to try to integrate those schools and the board decided after many years of effort that it would no longer do that but it was also of the firm conviction that it would allow students who wanted the opportunity to opt out of those schools to do so at the same time it implemented magnet schools at rainier beach theres a new building under construction at cleveland and so 
 are the students who are attending those schools getting the benefits of attending a school thats racially balanced and if they are not why are you not concerned about that if thats an important objective of your program 
 we we are concerned about improving the quality of education in all the schools we do not mandate that a student attend a school for integration purposes as we once did 
 why 
 because it its important to the credibility and functionality of the school system to have a system that is accepted by the public by our constituents and so people like choice they also like neighborhood schools they also like diverse schools and the board recognized when it set about to develop this plan that accommodating all of those values would require some tradeoffs and the board familiar with the local conditions familiar with the history did just that in what i submit was a narrowly tailored and appropriate way 
 may i go back to the cleveland school that justice alito mentioned an i correct that there were N percent whites under the plan and im just wondering what happened to it during the last couple of years 
 cleveland is now about N percent 
 and it was about half as many whites as there were under the plan 
 i dont remember the precise number in N but that sounds about right 
 mr madden there was a question raised about your categories that is you have white and then everything else and it was suggested that if you are looking for diversity what was the schools that you just mentioned had a large percentage of asianamericans but they dont count what is your response to that 
 well the the problem that the board was addressing was principally a a problem of the distribution of white and nonwhite students the as a generality N percent of all nonwhite students in the district lived in south seattle and that was true for all the ethnic groups except native americans who are a very small 
 why is that a problem suppose you have a school in which N percent of the students are either of asian ancestry or latino ancestry and N percent are white as you classify people and there are no africanamerican students at all you would consider that to be a racially balanced school would you not 
 i would say if that circumstance occurred that that would be something that the board would have to pay attention to and consider but the fact of the matter is that 
 nothing under the plan requires that does it 
 no because the numbers in terms of the distribution of ethnic groups separate ethnic groups and the benefits or impacts of the plan were spread proportionately 
 and what is the theory behind that is the theory is it that the white students there or the asian students or the latino students would not benefit from having africanamerican classmates it is enough if they have either asian classmates or latino classmates or white classmates how do you how do square that with your your objective of providing benefits that flow from racial balance 
 i may i may have confused the answer to the hypothetical with the with rationale on the ground which was that we did not have that kind of single minority ethnic group disparity existing in any school i was saying however that if that existed i think that would be something the board would have to be mindful of as a practical matter because our nonwhite ethnic neighborhoods in south seattle are themselves quite integrated that the movement under this plan did not produce disparities for or against any particular ethnic group and so i think in the end it might have been more divisive to have individual tiebreakers for the separate minority ethnic groups 
 what criteria of race does the school just out of curiosity does the school district use i mean what if a particular childs grandfather was white would he qualify as a white or nonwhite 
 i would say well the answer is 
 i mean there must be some criterion there are many people of mixed blood 
 the district has no criteria itself the district uses classifications that are developed by the federal government but allows parents to self identify children 
 it allows parents to say im white no matter what 
 that allows the parents to self identify and the record in this case through the testimony of petitioners president is they were aware of no abuse of that 
 seems like a big loophole 
 it seems like one but according to the record its not an issue id like to 
 you dont defend the choice policy on the basis that the schools offer education to everyone of the same quality do you 
 oh yes yes they offer the popular schools to which everyone had access under this plan who wanted access i think its there is no dispute 
 how is that different from the separate but equal argument in other words it doesnt matter that they are being assigned on the basis of their race because they are getting the same type of education 
 well because the schools are not racially separate the goal is to maintain the diversity that existed within a broad range in order to try to obtain the benefits that the educational research show flow from an integrated education 
 even though in the individual cases the students including minority students and i gather N to N of the cases are being denied admission on the basis of their race 
 they are not being denied admission they are being seats are being distributed to them this is not like 
 they are being denied admission to the school of their choice 
 yes but this is not like being denied admission to a states flagship university i think for that proposition i would cite justice powells opinion in the bakke case where he was at some pains to point out that a school integration plan is wholly dissimilar to a selective university admissions plan 
 if we look at the things that parents are concerned about when they are considering where their children are going to high school we look at things like sat scores for example or performance on statewide tests would we see that the oversubscribed schools and the undersubscribed schools have similar test scores 
 it depends on what school you are talking about justice alito in this case i think the most important point to start with is that there was no contention that there was any material difference in quality between the five popular high schools 
 well if we looked at garfield and cleveland what would we find 
 you would find a reasonable basis to perceive a quality difference between those two schools but this plan didnt assign any students to cleveland i want to take a moment if i can to turn to the issue of individualized consideration because so much emphasis has been placed on it in the earlier discussion it seems to us first of all that this court in grutter said that not all uses of race trigger the same objections and that the court must be mindful of the context this is not as i have said a selective or meritbased system where we adjudge one student to be better than the other we do consider individual factors before we get to race starting with choice and family connection and how close you live to the school but ultimately this is a distributive system which as justice powell as i noted justice powell said in the bakke case is quite wholly dissimilar to a merit or selectivebased system what it seems to us is being suggested by the united states and by the petitioner is a system that would force an individualized meritbased review on any kind of race conscious program specifically an assignment to public schools that rule allows the means to define the ends and it ends up i think defeating the purpose that the court had of not stigmatizing 
 but the reason that our prior tests have focused on individual determination is that the purpose of the equal protection clause is to ensure that people are treated as individuals rather than based on the color of their skin so saying that this doesnt involve individualized determinations simply highlights the fact that the decision to distribute as you put it was based on skin color and not any other factor 
 mr chief justice in grutter you said specifically that individualized review was required in the context of university admissions in this context the kind of review the specific kind of review that i understand the united states to urge and the petitioner to urge serves no purpose and it may itself be stigmatizing in the context of public schools where everyone gets a seat 
 you are saying that individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the objective here i thought thats what you were saying 
 justice ginsburg that is correct i am saying however that this plan consistent with narrow tailoring provided consideration of individual circumstances including an appeal on hardship grounds for someone who felt that they had been denied a school that they needed to be in 
 but the emphasis on the fact that everybody gets into a school it seems to me is misplaced but the question is whether or not you can get into the school that you really prefer and that in some cases depends solely on skin color you know its like saying everybody can have a meal but only people with separate skin can get the dessert 
 well like the michigan cases sometimes student in the end of the day have an assignment determined by race just like in the university cases at some point race will be a tipping factor its different though when we put someone in a basically comparable school 
 well you are saying every i mean everyone got a seat in brown as well but because they were assigned to those seats on the basis of race it violated equal protection how is your argument that theres no problem here because everybody gets a seat distinguishable 
 because segregation is harmful integration this court has recognized in swann in the first seattle case has benefits the district was 
 well it seems to me you are saying you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs can you think of any area of the law in which we say whatever it takes so long as theres a real need whatever it takes i mean if we have a lot of crime out there and the only way to get rid of it is to use warrantless searches you know fudge on some of the protections of the bill of rights whatever it takes we have got to do it is there any area of the law that doesnt have some absolute restrictions 
 there are many areas of the law certainly in the first amendment and the fourth amendment that have considerable flexibility 
 but what about the fourteenth i thought that was one of the absolute restrictions that you cannot judge and classify people on the basis of their race you can pursue the objectives that your school board is pursuing but at some point you come against an absolute and arent you just denying that 
 i think that in grutter and gratz this court rejected the absolute and instead described discretely which we feel we need and which is why we are not urging an absolute position we say that we indeed comply with the requirements of narrow tailoring and that the plan therefore should be upheld 
 and the question of integration whether there was any use of a racial criterion whether integration using racial integration is the same as segregation it seems to me is pretty far from the kind of headlines that attended the brown decision they were at last white and black children together on the same school bench that seems to be worlds apart from saying we will separate them 
 we certainly agree justice ginsburg wed go one step further and note that in brown this court said that the effects of segregated schools are worse 
 theres no effort here on the part of the school to separate students on the basis of race its an assignment on the basis of race correct 
 and it is in effect to bring students together in a mix that is not too far from their community i see that my time has expired thank you 
 thank you mr madden mr korrell you have four minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice there were some questions of my friend mr madden about the record and the statistics about enrollment and id like to draw the courts attention particularly justice breyer and justice stevens questions about what the schools look like now if the court looks at pages N and N of our reply brief we provided the enrollment data the information on page N comes from the school district website that provides enrollment data at the individual schools in N and N enrollment at the oversubscribed schools is now N percent nonwhite which is greater than it was under the districts 
 this is the as i gather the plan where race is used has to do only with the ninth grade and therefore what you would like to note is when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped using any racial criteria at all what happened to those ninth grade classes did they become more heavily separated or did they retain their diversity are the numbers that you are about to read us which i have in front of me going to do that tell us that i think they are about the whole school 
 they are your honor but they are about the whole school after four years of operating without the race preference so each of the four years they are represented in the aggregate shows the effect that i think your honor was asking about so the record in this case shows the seattle schools are richly diverse its very important in our view that the court not lose site of that we have talked about integration and segregation but i urge the court to take a look at the data the petitioners submit regarding the actual enrollment in those schools a couple of other record citations id like to bring to the courts attention justice kennedy i think asked about considering race at a last resort its simply not the case that the school district looked at race as a last resort and i would draw the courts attention to the superintendents testimony at joint appendix N and N where he said in essence the reason we didnt consider race neutral plans is because we were interested in racial diversity 
 the numbers i have here franklin went from N percent white to N percent roosevelt which was basically a white school jumped up from about N to N ballard jumped up from about N to N then garfield went down some more mixed but those were the worst ones am i right on that 
 your honor i think the numbers that you are reading are from the difference between the N and N and the N enrollments 
 okay 
 the numbers i was trying to bring to the courts attention were the difference between the enrollment under the racebased plan and the enrollment in N and N which shows significant and continued racial diversity in seattles high schools counsel suggested also that there is no material difference among the five oversubscribed schools and i would draw the courts attention to the testimony of the board president at joint appendix N to N where she discusses in detail the programmatic differences it is true that those five schools were oversubscribed and they were popular but they all provide unique programs some of which as we indicated in our briefs required children to meet certain prerequisites to be able to attend 
 was the board simultaneously trying to introduce similar programs or attractive programs in the undersubscribed schools 
 your honor im perhaps not the best person to answer that i believe the board has been trying to introduce programs at all of its schools that would make each school unique and i think that includes the undersubscribed schools as well justice breyer asked a question about the about the process of this litigation and my understanding is there was never a lawsuit against seattle to compel desegregation that they were always following a plan 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in N meredith versus jefferson county board of education mr gordon 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court crystal meredith wanted to do what most moms and dads do all across this country she wanted to put her sons hand in hers and walk around the corner and enroll her son in school but the enrollment there was a barrier and the pickaxe that barrier was person satisfied as a quota there were seats within the school it wasnt at capacity it wasnt near any one of the percentages or tipping percentages that the quota system in jefferson county public schools applied but she was not allowed in 
 was that because she applied N months late if she had applied before the deadline in march would you be here would there be any issue 
 well of course justice ginsburg she moved into the system in august when she moved into the system she was assigned to a school called breckenridgefranklin which was an all year round school then she was her choice was managed and she was sent an hour away from where her other school is she applied by transfer which is the system that you use 
 where was she living before 
 i think she was living in florida and she moved into kentucky 
 so she that was august was the first opportunity she had to apply 
 yes so thats across the board anyone that moves in they are there is a cluster school or an attempt school and if you are not a majority of the time you are not allowed there because of your race in other words they want to assign children to schools that dont have the greater percentages of either africanamerican or caucasian so in bloom elementary although it was N and keep in mind in kindergarten according to their own rules and regulations didnt even apply the plan was so inflexible 
 but she she could have if she had been there at the deadline the child would have been admitted to if she had been there in march instead of august 
 but the deadline applies to that school which presumably is closest to ones residence now whether or not you get into that school or dont get into the school still depends on the quota 
 well we are past that when she didnt get the assignment that she requested for her son 
 sure 
 did she appeal that 
 she filed a transfer the transfer was denied and at that time litigation had commenced and because litigation had commenced and routinely these appeals are denied all of her efforts were futile 
 how about for first grade did she make an application for first grade 
 me understanding is that she did that was denied because the only time joshua got into 
 and thats in the record that she made an application for the first grade 
 i believe it is i believe it is in either event if she didnt it would have been futile because we had already made her the third amended complaint on behalf of all the parties and we had asked for injunctive relief within the litigation but joshua did not get into the school because of until they moved they had to move a block away so if you live in one block and you cant get into that school your choice is managed the plan was clearly inflexibility and it didnt apply to kindergarten anyhow but it still caused our joshua to go an hour away from his home 
 do you have a claim for damages as well 
 yes your honor 
 with respect to this plaintiff 
 yes your honor i believe its the third amended complaint the may N nd complaint and there was a request for $N damages and within these schools in other words this honorable court has never applied other than in remedial has never applied compelling interest in a k through N setting in fact those rights are not coextensive the school this honorable court has previously stated in for example the hazelwood case which was a first amendment right case that that didnt apply to k through N or should it be N through N setting and in the hazelwood case that was a basic first amendment right and of course the first amendment right was exactly what justice powell championed as academic freedom within the bakke case so clearly bakke and grutter are distinguishable this falls into gratz where you clearly have a quota not less than N or greater than N percent is totally inflexible as applied to our 
 how does it compare with the system that was in effect from what was it N until N 
 im sorry its the same remedial program that this court has found even in dowd that when the remedial program has achieved its result we should no longer carve out that exemption under the equal protection clause 
 do you think that theres something of an anomaly there that you have a system that is forced on the school that it doesnt want it works for N years and then the school board doesnt have to keep it any more but it decides its worked rather well so we will keep it whats constitutionally required one day gets constitutionally prohibited the next day thats very odd 
 well i take issue that it worked very well in other words did the jefferson county 
 the board decided it liked the way things were going so it kept it or something close to it 
 well of course brown versus topeka board of education was time applicable if you use time applicable now for the jefferson county public schools 
 im talking about the plan that they have had for N years and they decided to keep it 
 and in the hampton case which i won all right they didnt go to any raceneutral alternatives at all as justice kennedy pointed out im sorry 
 mr gordon in responding to justice ginsburgs question dont you have to deal with the fact that this court said in the second swann case that the that a school district particularly a school district like swann which had been in violation had been found in violation had the same interest after unitary status had been attained in maintaining the unitary status as it had in reaching unitary status beforehand that if those interests are identical why doesnt it follow that the means to achieve those two interests unitary status from segregation in one case preservation of unitary status in the other are reasonable if they are identical 
 well justice souter this court over and over again has said once a remedial plan is accepted there should be raceneutral alternatives under the narrow and tailored requirement what this school board did after i won 
 raceneutral alternatives for what to accomplish what 
 to accomplish the same means in other words what they could have done as justice kennedy pointed out was put more magnet schools more traditional schools have more open enrollment 
 mr gordon isnt it the case that once you have achieved unitary status which means that the effects of past intentional discrimination have been eliminated the only way you can lose unitary status is to discriminate intentionally isnt that right 
 certainly thats the dow case that says you no longer 
 and isnt there a distinction between unitary status and unitary condition unitary condition is a descriptive situation it describes a district in which there is in fact enough of a racial mix so that there is no credible claim either that there is de facto or de jure segregation isnt that correct there is such a thing as unitary a unitary condition 
 certainly 
 and is the preservation of a unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling governmental objective 
 in hampton this our court found that it was unitary status as opposed to unitary condition 
 uhhuh 
 if you want to go with unitary condition then i still think you go back to brown and you say has it worked in other words lets make it time applicable does this honorable court 
 what do you mean it doesnt work i dont understand 
 it hasnt worked it just absolutely hasnt worked so we have decided 
 i dont understand what it is that hasnt worked 
 why do we have to choose between diversity and educational outcome i thought it was supposed to be both why cant we have diverse why cant we have them both its not diversity or educational outcome its diversity and educational outcome for N years in this country 
 i think thats what your friends on the other side are arguing 
 no the friends on the other side are arguing that theres some type of improvement in educational outcome solely because you sit black children next to white children 
 not an improvement exactly but maybe from the constitutions point of view that constitution wanted as they said in the slaughterhouse cases to take people who had formerly been slaves and their children and make them full members of american society and part of that was that the state couldnt insist that they go to separate schools now the question from a constitutional point of view that you are being asked is how could that constitution which says that this is intolerable that segregated school and insist that the school boards in swann and elsewhere take the black children and white children and integrate them how could the constitution the day that that decree is removed tell the school board it cannot make that effort any more it cant do what its been doing and we will send the children back to their black schools and their white schools that i take it is why the court in swann said explicitly that you could use race as a factor in the public schools when the school board so chooses now thats the general question that i think justice ginsburg began and justice souter was following it up and i would appreciate your response 
 my response is that you have those series of cases that say once you have achieved the unitary status you know longer get to carve out that exemption to the fourteenth amendment and if we are going to carve out these exemptions to the fourteenth amendment if we are going to say we are going to not apply gratz where its a quota system and we are solely without any type of individual holistic review applied to these kids then there should be some improvement in 
 how would you apply a holistic review to a kindergartner 
 well of course this system didnt apply to kindergarten anyhow but the answer is its not you have to decide 
 i can understand an approach to an applicant for an elite school and so you judge it on all these merit factors and other factors but for a child entering the first grade i dont understand this individualized holistic approach what else is there other than that the child is of a certain age and therefore will enter a certain grade 
 that it would violate your ruling in gratz 
 i want to know you said that there are alternate alternative means so im asking what they are 
 out of hampton there was no raceneutral race alternative means used for me i would use all these millions of dollars i would reduce teacherstudent ratio i would i would give incentive pay to the better teachers i would more magnet schools more traditional schools we presuppose that we are going to have bad schools and good schools in this country i dont think we can no longer longer accept that we can no longer accept an achievement gap of N to N points by the majority of african american kids in jefferson county kentucky and throughout this country by the fourth grade educational outcome is the only key the only key to unlock the chains of poverty 
 and its not that white children and black children are no longer sitting together on the same school benches 
 then lets make sure they go to the better schools in jefferson county kentucky racial politics is involved when we had so much white flight african americans in jefferson county kentucky the largest percent go to the worst performing schools the lowest percent go to the better performing schools that cant be constitutional that cant be discriminatory and that cant be an exemption under the fourteenth amendment and equal protection id like to save a little bit the remainder of my time your honor 
 thank you counsel general clement 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court petitioners son was denied the opportunity to transfer from young elementary school to bloom elementary school solely on the basis of his race 
 general clement can i ask you a question thats prompted really by your argument in the last case i wonder about the purity of the motive thats required supposing you had a city like chicago with a neighborhood school system and in one neighborhood there was a school that was N percent african american both student body and faculty and up on the north side theres a school thats N percent white both students and faculty would it be permissible for the school board to decide that it would be healthy for both schools to have five african american schools in the north side school and five white teachers in the south side school 
 justice stevens 
 and then order that hire teachers to do that 
 i think id have to i mean i think it would depend 
 the only purpose is racial integration 
 i think if you build into the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was done in a way that made it express that the teachers were going to be moved that you were basically going to have five and five you were going to have a quota at the two schools on the basis of race i would say that that would be unconstitutional i would think though that there are many ways you can accomplish similar objectives without making it so explicit and i do think that in this context i mean there is an independent constitutional value in not having these kind of express racial classifications drawn 
 i understand and im just wondering whether in your view that independent value could ever be trumped by the obvious countervailing value of having some african americans see some white teachers and vice versa 
 oh but i think thats the point which is that is an important objective but i have little doubt that that can be accomplished without the kind of five by five quotas 
 you have doubt you have little doubt are you an educational expert i mean the it seems to me from what i read that there is a terrible problem in the country the problem is that there are lots and lots of school districts that are becoming more and more segregated in fact and that school boards all over are struggling with this problem and if they knew an easy way theyd do it so i dont know whether this is exactly the only way to do it or not i do know courts are not very good at figuring that out and i guess thats why the court previously has said it is primarily up to the school district whats your response 
 whatever it takes 
 justice breyer if i could be clear though what i was saying in response to justice stevens question was really focused not on the broader problem but specifically with respect to faculties and i think that one is a little easier in the sense that i dont know of any school districts that have tried to maintain the kind of express quotas in teaching that he was indicating im not here to tell you that this problem is simple to solve im here to tell you though that i think the constitution provides an answer 
 just say some we want to we are going to make a decision there will be some white teachers and some africanamerican teachers in the other and we are going to do it no matter if the constitution permits it and thats our only motive 
 well justice stevens let me tell you what i certainly think they could do which is to say look you know we dont have any balance in these two faculties what we are going to do is we are going to mix some of them up we are going to do it in a way that looks at a variety of factors including who is good with young kids who is good with older kids 
 my example is N percent motive to avoid N percent segregation 
 and i think if what they end up doing at the end is not only a hundred percent motive but a racial classification then i think runs afoul of the constitution 
 just some any without violating the constitution 
 just to be clear our answer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation no racial classification is that it is still okay now some members of the court may disagree with us on that but what i would say is it probably doesnt have that great an import in practice because although it is easy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the absolute and sole motivating factor i think in this context in particular i mean nobody you know nobody is trying to do this solely for a racebased motive in this context they also have an educational goal 
 general clement do you know how joshua would have been assigned prior to the establishment of unitary status in this case 
 he would clearly have been assigned to one school and one set of schools on the basis of his race 
 you dont know whether that would have been the magnet or the socalled resides school or somewhere else 
 no i guess i dont and maybe im missing something but i think that you know the dual school system predated the court ordered decree which is part of where we have gotten to with resides schools and the like if i can come back to the facts of this case i think its important to recognize that he was denied transfer to bloom even though there were empty seats available at bloom school so if he had been an africanamerican he would have been allowed to transfer to bloom instead he was prevented and there was an empty seat sitting there in that school and thats why i think this case does prevent a very stark racial quota 
 may i ask you this and i think this applies to the case we have got as well as to justice stevens hypothetical you said in justice stevens in answer to justice stevens hypothetical that they could achieve a result legitimately achieve a result of racial mixture within the respective faculties of these schools if they took other things in addition to race into consideration you mentioned ability as teachers and so on but at the end of the day the object of doing this which justice stevens hypo assumed and i think the object of doing it which your answer assumed was the achievement of racial mixture in the faculties my question is why do thy have to hide the ball by saying oh we are going to consider these other things ability to teach educational credits whatever you could come up with when at the beginning and at the end the objective is to achieve a racial mix why cant they do that candidly and employ a criterion that candidly addresses that objective 
 well justice souter there are several responses one is that the constitution puts a particular premium on avoiding express racial classifications 
 and it has developed that concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to hurt or to stigmatize here there is stigmatization going on as between black and white when we say there is a value in mixing them up therefore why should that same concern about referring to race at all be applied in this case 
 well justice souter you may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it was clear there was stigma going on but you have extended it in croson and in adarand across the board and i have to say 
 we have extended it in cases in which benefits were being denied in justice stevens hypothetical and so far as i know in the kindergarten system in these cases no educational benefit was being denied 
 i think 
 nothing was being rationed 
 well i think choices were being denied and i think you made the distinction earlier between an educational guarantee of some educational opportunity and a choice but 
 but that is simply another way when you say it is the choice thats being denied and that has to be the focus of the analysis that is simply another way of saying you may never use the means of raceconscious distribution to achieve the educational objective you are saying the same thing in a different way 
 that may be justice souter but what i guess i would say is the logic of your argument would certainly require reconsideration of the gratz case and this court in that context thought that individualized consideration even if it was going to be very difficult in the context of the university of michigans N admissions to the undergraduate program this court said individualized consideration was part of the constitutional guarantee 
 in gratz the characteristics of individuals that could be considered were arguably relevant to a distribution decision here the sole point is not to achieve a quota by relaxing other standards the whole point is to achieve a value which comes from mixing the races from distribution and therefore why is it appropriate to look to other things as opposed to looking at that candidly if that is a legitimate objective 
 because i think justice souter if you think it is an important value to have a degree of integration in the schools well i think you can take race neutral means that will get you a degree of integration in the schools what i think is troubling and what happens in cases like this 
 but you may use those race neutral means only for the purpose of achieving that mixture i take it thats the assumption of your answer 
 thats right 
 the objective is fine the important thing is simply to hide the ball 
 but if you decide that candor is an affirmative good in the use in the race area i think what you get is necessarily what you have here which is strict racial bands N N percent thats not a degree of integration it is a clear effort to try to get the individual schools to mimic the overall demographics 
 why is im trying to find out i understand what you think of gratz we can agree or disagree about that but the overall view of the constitution that interpretation that you have in your mind if it really forbids it no use of race i mean basically all right think go back to cooper versus aaron go back to the case where this court with paratroopers had to use tremendous means to get those children into the school thats because the society was divided here we have a society black and white who elect school board members who together have voted to have this form of integration why given that change in society which is a good one what how can the constitution be interpreted in a way that would require us the judges to go in and make them take the black children out of the school see my objection to your approach to the constitution is primarily a practical one 
 well i understand that justice breyer but i think the answer to that is that the lesson of history in this area is that racial classifications are not ones where we should just let local school board officials do what they think is right 
 are you prepared to just say all right they can do it some just be careful about it how far will you go with that 
 i think everybody concedes that strict scrutiny is going to apply here 
 all right so you are saying we will do it some just be careful about it 
 no we would you know i think we would have to look at the details of the plan thats what narrow tailoring meant and i think thats what you know justice kennedy made the point in his opinion in grutter that the problem with approving the first blunderbuss opportunity that you see to use race in a context is that then you deprive the courts of any role trying to refine matters and seeing maybe the racial situation would be narrowly tailored but it is sure not these N bands 
 judge kozinski thought the real problem here was we should not deify strict scrutiny thats whats caused all the problems 
 and justice stevens he probably could have cited two of your opinions for that proposition but you know the rest of us do have to work with 
 it is often true that sometimes doctrines do have unintended consequences when you push the logic of extremes there is no doubt about that 
 theres no doubt about that but the rest of us do have to work with this courts precedents 
 and they also have unintended consequences when this court ignores them 
 absolutely and it also has some real world consequences when we decides we are not going to apply the normal scrutiny we would to racial classifications just because we have made some i dont know based on what judgment that in this case it is benign so we can trust the local school officials 
 well it isnt that we have made a judgment the local school board has made a judgment which has a lot of experience under both systems 
 theres a lot of experience in brown too and those were local school boards too and i think the lesson is 
 do we know the race of the school board here i mean that was not how do we know these are benign school boards is it stipulated that they are benign school boards 
 i missed that in the joint stipulation justice scalia i would like to say one if i could make one point here which is i really do think that its worth looking at how this operates in practice and the fact that it leaves seats effectively fallow in schools because that really marks it as a quota and its interesting when that same district court judge 
 was that how it worked under the plan that was forced on the school district i thought it was roughly the same plan 
 it was justice ginsburg but i think theres a difference when you move past unitary status its interesting in the very case where the court hampton ii where the same district court found unitary status he then because the equal protection clause was not shielded by the decree had to apply it to the use of these same racial bands in the context of magnet schools and what did this same district court judge find there he found they operated quote as a hard racial quota because the effect of these N bands was to keep hundreds of seats at central high school a popular magnet school empty and away from africanamerican students because the district wanted to maintain its predetermined racial balance 
 am i right in thinking that the government in N opposed terminating this the compulsory plan 
 you mean the united states government 
 yes 
 or the school board they actually both opposed which is something shows you something of the anomalies that you can get from this situation which is the school board wanting to continue its practice of using these racial guidelines actually opposed the finding of unitary status i would say though 
 i thought it was the united states 
 yeah we had some specific objections in which we thought that two of the green factors were not satisfied that argument was rejected by the district court if i can go back to the judges finding about the magnet schools what is so interesting is the same judge finds the same guidelines to be a hard racial quota as to the magnet schools but not as to the neighborhood schools why does he make that distinction because he finds that the neighborhood schools are basically equal and therefore denying a student an opportunity to attend to one rather than another was not an injury of constitutional magnitude but i would have thought it is far too late in the day and the chief justice suggested this as well to say that just because two schools are basically equal you can deny a student the right to attend one and assigns one and only one based on his race thank you 
 thank you general clement mr mellen 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this case presents a story of a community that once maintained racially segregated schools that desegregated those schools only when a court ordered it and that today maintains racially integrated schools with broad community support this case presents a story of a board of education that replaced a desegregation decree with a student assignment plan that works that stopped the white flight that was the result of the desegregation decree and has stabilized enrollment in our public schools this case presents a success story and its a success that was achieved in compliance with this courts strict scrutiny test 
 does this case present the story where the meaning of brown versus board of education is you can never take race out of politics 
 i think your honor that brown is very much distinguishable in brown the topeka board maintained two systems of schools and admission to those schools admission not assignment was based solely on race that stigmatized the black children it sent the message that the white race was dominant and superior and that the black race was inferior that caused great harm to those black students and this court properly remediated it 
 and this doesnt i mean this which is somehow based on the notion that a school that is predominantly black or overwhelmingly black cannot be as good as a school that is predominantly white or overwhelmingly white that doesnt send any message 
 the plan your honor is not based solely on that supposition this plan is based on the supposition that a school that is racially identifiable and that would include a white racially identifiable school does not provide to the students in that school the compelling benefits that our board believes are presented by racial integration the compelling benefits some of which are the benefits that this court identified in grutter from the racial diversity that was a byproduct 
 you are talking about white flight you are not talking about black flight and whats going on here is makes sure that there are a certain number of white students or as high a proportion as you can get in schools that would be otherwise be overwhelmingly black and it seems to me if you are appealing to stigmatization that that is based on an assumption that it seems to me is stigmatizing 
 this plan and the federal courts have held for years school districts do have an interest in avoiding white flight and as i said this plan has prevented has stopped white flight and has stabilized enrollment in our schools but this this plan was adopted your honor for the purpose of providing the compelling benefits of racial integration some of which this court identified in grutter some of which the district court found were not present in the university of michigan law school case but are present in an elementary and secondary system of schools for example the district court found that this plan makes our public schools more competitive and attractive and results in broader community support for those schools 
 i i think thats probably true i think it is also probably true that the people in your community and the people on your school board are acting in the utmost good faith and that what they have done is going to help the education of many students the question is whether or not we can say that an insincere school board people that want to play the race card who want to play the race trip the the race chip that want a system in which they can use race for political advantage can do this based on the color of the individual childs skin thats whats involved here 
 i dont think thats what is involved in this case your honor because the district court found that the boards motives were indeed legitimate and that there was no basis 
 im conceding that the constitution assumes that this might not always be the case are we going to look at the sincerity of the school boards school by school board school board member by school board member 
 i dont think that would be proper for the courts to do that your honor but the other issue thats presented by these cases is whether the use of race is narrowly tailored and the district court found in this case that it was was for a variety of reasons so i think that this case does not your honor present the hypothetical that you suggested and in other cases with different factors 
 but it but it presents the principle that this court is confronted with if we for the first time say that a system that has achieved unitary status so that the courts no longer have the authority or the need to supervise them can then turn around and use individual skin color as a basis for assignment we have never said that and that takes us on a very perilous course 
 you have never said it your honor and the question has never been presented a similar question was presented in the university of michigan law school case and this court held the use of a racial classification to satisfy a compelling interest and in a narrowly tailored manner 
 in the university cases this court ran as far away as it could from using racial quotas it talked about the fact that there was an individualized assessment at at issue was a university student who could understand the reasons for being rejected on on the grounds of race race being one criteria that isnt this case 
 thats not this case your honor because our board asserts a different compelling interest the compelling interest asserted by the michigan law school was viewpoint diversity a different kind of its a byproduct of that this court asserts an interest in this board im sorry asserts an interest in racial integration and we believe that there are compelling benefits from racial integration and that this board provides them to all students both black and white 
 once again once again one of the rationales for the law school cases was a first amendment rationale and you and i think properly so say that this is this is not your interest i agree with you but that means that that case is completely inapplicable to help you 
 i dont think its completely inapplicable your honor because this case presents the same basic doctrinal question that was presented in grutter whether a government agency can use race as a classification with a compelling interest with narrow tailoring this court in grutter identified several benefits of racial diversity some of those benefits are presented in the elementary and secondary school context and we have additional benefits that are presented by racial integration 
 mr mellen here is a question i should have asked friends on the other side but i think it is raised by justice kennedys question so let me put it out are there circumstances under which there is reason to suspect the motivation of school districts when they come up with a plan in effect to require a mixing of the races in the schools that is more or less tailored to the relative percentages in the communities is are there circumstances in which that would be done for malign as opposed to benign purposes 
 i think it could be your honor and this court has said 
 and what give me some or give me or an example 
 your honor im not sure i can think of one because i come from a community with a long history of of not doing that 
 easy easy take a school district that is overwhelmingly minority and overwhelmingly black if you will and a school board that reflects that and in which by reason of residential patterns the white schools despite the same expenditure of money same level of teaching and everything else the white schools are better schools and the school board could decide we would like our race to get into those better white schools not because we want mixing we just want want them to get into those schools wouldnt that be a situation in which the board could then come up with a you know these good schools ought to have N percent blacks in them i would not consider that a benign objective 
 there might be your honor under those circumstances a compelling interest in doing that the question would be whether it is narrowly tailored but 
 i dont think theres a compelling interest in doing it at all they are doing it for a racially selfish reason they want their constituency they want the N percent of black students to be in the better schools you consider that a valid interest and a nonracial interest 
 no no your honor of course with that explanation i do not 
 do you think the school board in that case would use the clumsy means of racial integrational mixing as opposed simply to devoting more money to the black schools 
 i would certainly think your honor that a wise school board would use other methods to achieve that result yes 
 i would think so too 
 why did you say in truth maybe i missed it in your response to justice kennedy i think you said when he asked that this court has never said that the explicit use of race by a k through N school board was constitutional and i thought the court had explicitly said that in swann 
 i i 
 i thought that that justice powell explicitly said it i that chief justice rehnquist had explicitly said it i thought if you went back in sense to the slaughterhouse cases you will find in N this court thought that the primary objective the primary objective of that fourteenth amendment was to take people who had been formerly slaves and to bring them into this society and that all of phrases of that amendment should be interpreted with that objective in mind i mean it didnt say that explicitly there but it seems explicitly and implicitly this court has said that 
 well i agree justice breyer and i misspoke i used one word incorrectly i said i should have said this court has not held i agree with general clement that swann was dictum but a very strong dictum and we do think it applies here dictum 
 well i think i think we were communicating swann was a case where there was de jure discrimination bakke was a university case this is a different case 
 it is indeed a different case your honor we do not 
 and its and its a troubling case 
 we do not contend your honor that the purpose of this plan is to remediate past discrimination against black students this plan is intended to provide benefits to both black and white students 
 so your arguments do not depend in any way on the prior de jure segregation 
 they do not your honor we would agree that we stand on the same footing as the seattle district as a unitary district this case needs to be measured against whether a board has a compelling interest and or board feels quite strongly that there is compelling interest for the racial classification thats employed in 
 what about the other part because i think the solicitor general i hope i dont want to put words in his mouth but i think he agrees that brown held out the promise of an equal education that the country worked for N or N years to try to get a degree of integration and that maintaining it is important i think the government agrees with that they think this case goes too far and in that i think hes referring to narrow tailoring it isnt narrowly tailored enough so i would appreciate knowing why you think it is 
 we think it is your honor for the very reasons that the district court held it is the district court addressed each of these points regarding narrow tailoring which this court identified in grutter looked at them very carefully and concluded that it is narrowly tailored one of that issues thats already been discussed this morning is individual consideration we agree with the position that the circuit court took in the ninth circuit that in a situation in which the compelling interest is racial integration that it makes no sense to take into account other background characteristics of students other than their race 
 if it were to become relevant would this record show this is the school district and this would be in the regime of the courtordered desegregation plan because you are just recently emerged from that that the school district has tried means other than race conscious of race classification in order to obtain the diversity benefits you seek 
 the school district has your honor in fact this plan uses those 
 and were those magnet schools and could you tell me about that 
 magnet schools your honor and with respect to history your honor it is somewhat complex because although the court ruled in the hampton case in N that the degree was dissolved then the board honestly felt beginning in N that the decree had been dissolved and so the board in N N N made what it thought were voluntary modifications to the plan beginning in the late N s the board began to introduce more choice into the system including magnet schools magnet programs the board uses race neutral lotteries to determine enrollment in some schools but the board feels and it feels very strongly based on conversations that board members and staff people have had with other school districts that have tried raceneutral measures including charlotte mecklenburg wake county and san francisco that raceneutral measures alone will not do the job and the experience in those districts indicates that they will not do the job 
 but your starting place was the plan that was compulsory that was forced on the school district in N that is basically the same kind of plan 
 well your honor i would say that the starting point was that plan the board has modified it considerably since then to make assignments more stable and predictable to make the use of race more narrowly tailored it is in concept the same plan because it has some of the features but the board has added many features that that plan did not have the N desegregation decree was really quite a blunt instrument and thats why it was so controversial in the community thats why there was massive white flight this plan this board has very wisely modified that plan to make it much more acceptable to the community so that we stopped the white flight we stabilized our enrollment we have a community now that very broadly the public opinion surveys show that supports racial integration whereas in N they were opposed to it sometimes violently this is as i said at the outset a success story 
 what would happen if you couldnt use this system 
 and that would depend your honor on what this court said we could not use we do know that four of our schools magnet schools are now not subject to racial guidelines because of the district courts decision in the hampton N case one of those schools central high school is far outside the racial guidelines it has a black enrollment of about N percent at two of those other magnet schools black enrollment has declined its declined by about by about a third in two of those schools and that is only in the space of a few years our school board staff has conducted some hypothetical scenarios as to what would happen without the racial guidelines some hypothetical scenarios involve choice some involve purely neighborhood schools all of those scenarios show substantial resegregation particularly in elementary schools 
 do any of those study the possibilities of the system in which you elect to go into a system where race counts 
 some of those scenarios your honor did have some degree of choice 
 are they written out anywhere we can see them or are there articles on this 
 they are not in the record in this case your honor they were in the record in the hampton case so if you read the hampton N opinion you will see that the district court included a lengthy footnote in which he basically summarized those scenarios 
 if you say your plan has the overwhelming support of the community does community mean those parent who have children in the schools 
 some of the 
 it seems to me that ought to be the really the people who are the objects of this experiment do they think its doing 
 they do indeed your honor those surveys were surveys by the university of kentucky research center of parents 
 and did the parents satisfaction with it break out along racial lines or was it evenly divided 
 it was fairly evenly divided your honor one of our expert witnesses said that well both of them said that they were quite surprised that the findings were so positive one of the expert witnesses said that unquestionably this is a community that values diversity 
 where is that 
 thats the testimony of edward kiefer your honor from the university of kentucky he was responsible for the survey 
 and hes talking about the parents of students in the school 
 thats correct your honor thats there are some other surveys i believe that include the entire community but i think you will see in the record some that are parents only i would like your honor justice ginsburg to respond very briefly to some of the facts concerning joshua because you asked about that there is nothing in the record that says that ms meredith moved into the district in florida just when she showed up at breckenridgefranklin with respect to her appeal in fact the litigation had not commenced when she would have had an opportunity to file an appeal the stipulation of facts says that she did not apply for joshua for the first grade now ms bloom excuse me ms meredith and this is not in the record because it took place after the record was closed but ms meredith reapplied for a transfer after joshua finished the first grade that transfer was initially denied she appealed the transfer was granted and joshua does now attend bloom i think thats relevant because the solicitor general made an argument in his brief that this plan allows the student to be trapped in a school we would certainly not agree that an assignment to any one of our fine schools could be a trap but in any event students can reapply each year and that has happened it happened here in the case of joshua 
 can you tell me how is race used do the administrators have discretion in the weight they will give to it on a case by case basis 
 i dont think exactly your honor race is used as the district court found really as the final factor a tipping factor residence comes into play choice comes into play lotteries in some schools come into play 
 im not sure how to ask the question is it used fairly evenly across the board when it is the tiebreaker 
 we dont used the word tiebreaker your honor the record indicates 
 to tip the tipping point whatever 
 the record indicates that race would be the dispositive factor in no more than N to N percent of the choice applications 
 that means that leads to the question of why do they need it 
 i think they need it your honor because it sets a boundary it defines what racial integration means if staff had come to this board with a plan that said our goal is racial integration 
 so its symbolic that race counts 
 i dont think so your honor i think it simply sets the outer limits within which our process of choice and other methods of assignment works without that boundary it could be transgressed one student at a time the guidelines i think are very much like the little boy in the dutch story who put his finger in the dike because a few drops of water were coming out he knew it would become a flood eventually if he didnt do that we think that is exactly the case here that without these guidelines one student at a time could transgress them and ultimately we would have a resegregated school system 
 mr mellen i have been looking at dr kiefers testimony is this what you are referring to there was remarkable agreement among every group in jefferson county public schools about how desirable having diversity in the schools was 
 thats correct your honor 
 i have no double about that i mean if you are going to ask anybody you know do you prefer integrated schools or would you prefer lilywhite schools nobody is going to say give me a lilywhite school of course nobodys going to say that i was asking whether the parents whose kids cant go to the schools they want to go to including the neighborhood schools do they like this particular system of achieving the racial diversity is there any testimony about that 
 the great majority do your honor and i think if you look at the university of 
 black and white alike 
 black and white alike in large numbers no plan your honor can be 
 how do we know that 
 again your honor the university of kentucky survey which is in the record 
 it is in the record 
 broke it down by race among parents it asked whether guidelines were proper it asked whether assignment on socioeconomic status would be preferred there are a lot of questions in that survey and i think you might find 
 its not in your joint appendix here 
 its not in the joint appendix its an exhibit i believe to the stipulation of facts your honor 
 there were questions earlier about the status of the particular plaintiff you are not challenging standing or raising mootness are you 
 no we are not your honor we are not challenging standing we are simply saying that ms meredith did not suffer undue harm within the meaning of this courts decisions and that parents as a whole and students as a whole do not suffer undue harm there have questions in the first case about an end point i might address that briefly we believe that the use of race in this plan is selflimiting in several respects if racially segregated housing in jefferson county continues to decline which it has somewhat since the N s and the board has reason to believe that the presence of racially integrated schools during that period contributed to that there are several amicus briefs that were filed in this case that set forth research that supports that conclusion if racially segregated housing continues to decline and if this plan meets its purpose of diminishing racial stereotypes and promoting better crossracial understanding throughout the community we can foresee a time when this board will not see a reason to use this plan or may modify it further to make it even less restrictive 
 in a time horizon longer or shorter than the N year time horizon that was discussed in grutter 
 i cant predict the future your honor i can say it could be shorter for another reason that is that this plan is inherently subject to democratic review by elected school board and by the voters it could end sooner than that if the board and the voters change their minds i cant predict whether it might end longer than that i can only say that this board has a long history of modifying the plan as i said they modified it in N N N N its in the very nature of how a board of education works that they continue to tinker with things 
 if the attitude is the one that this board has taken then the same reasons would exist for the plan as long as there is segregation in housing 
 i wouldnt limit that limit it to that your honor i think that an important factor are racial attitudes in the community i think that this board feels that the plan does serve to ameliorate racial stereotypes promote crossracial understanding our community still has a long way to go in that respect we do have some racial issues in jefferson county but we believe this plan helps them and in the future a board may look at our community may look at how racial relations work in our community and may well decide that even though housing is still somewhat segregated we can do without this plan or again we can modify it to make it less restrictive which in fact the history of this plan shows that this board has done 
 well what would this board have to have in order for it not to be temporally limited in your opinion any plan can be changed in the future so why does the fact that this can be changed in the future make it a plan that has a temporal limitation 
 well your honor it does not have fixed temporal limitation of N years or N years as i said thats not how school boards operate but it is inherently subject to review on a temporal basis because each time we have a school board election the plan potentially is in play and it could be modified at any time in that sense i see that my time is almost up if there are no further 
 may i just was there a petition for a rehearing en banc in this case 
 there was your honor in the sixth circuit and it was denied 
 were there any votes in favor of the en banc rehearing 
 your honor as i recall the sixth circuits order it said that no judge asked for a rehearing en banc 
 the court thank you mr mellen mr gordon you have N minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice first of all to respond to one of the questions that was asked its very important that it is equally consistent in the N plan to effectuate or to prevent white flight that the plan itself was changed to subjugate african american kids to the worse performing schools if you find that equally consistent then you have a question of whether or not illegitimate notions of racial inferiority applied or racial politics applied 
 excuse me i didnt understand it 
 well in the N plan and from that point on which i showed which was held in the hampton plan in the hampton case in other words in the hampton case i proved or the facts proved or the plaintiff proved that african american kids were denied entrance into the better schools solely because of race within the vacuum of that case there was also proof that showed the largest percent of african american kids were sent or denigrated or subjugated to the worse performing schools rather than the best performing schools that becomes the question of racial politics and racial animus and thats what the N plan did and what it did to attract or prevent white flight was have less african american kids go to the better performing schools on the entire k through N setting that cant be what this court wants to carve out as an exemption to the equal protection clause the equal protection clause thats on neutral parchment with black ink theres no percents theres no box to check we cant have this in our school system to have another N or N years in our school system which will perpetuate racial isolationism because it does nothing to stop the achievement gap there were raceneutral alternative tracks all i can say is that may this day be the embryonic beginning of dr kings dream as paraphrased that all children are now judged by the content of their character and their education not by the color of their skin 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in burton versus stewart mr fisher 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court in sharp versus pain the ninth circuit opinion that first decided the question thats before you today the ninth circuit said and im quoting the rule of blakely that the statutory maximum is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict was not clear until the blakely decision itself the ninth circuit is simply wrong in this courts apprendi decision it laid down precisely that rule at page N of that decision this court described the statutory maximum concept as quote the maximum a defendant would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone virtually the identical language 
 mr fisher you know assuming we read it the way you read it i have got a official basic problem that doesnt really surface until you get to the end of the briefs and i wonder if you would comment on it at the beginning of the argument that is or i will put it in the form of a question is the decision which the judge makes here to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently a decision that requires the finding of any fact about the commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances of those crimes or about the defendants character does the judge have to make or does the fact some fact finder have to make a finding on any of those subjects crimes circumstances character of the defendant 
 yes he does justice souter 
 what is that fact 
 its precisely the same kind of fact that the judge had to find in blakely itself under the washington revised code of washington the statute the statute for running sentences consecutively in the fashion that mr burtons were run consecutively refers the judge back to the very same provision that was at issue in blakely itself which is the aggravating factors provision of washington which was formerly codified at section N and is now codified at section N official 
 i thought the only fact that had to be found was that given the classification sentencing scheme washington had there would be in effect a free crime no incremental punishment unless there were consecutive sentencing thats not a fact that falls within any of those categories of crime character or circumstances 
 that would be a fact justice souter but that is not the way the washington law works it is colloquially known as the free crime aggravator but in the washington supreme court decision in hughes which is cited at the end of our reply brief the washington supreme court made clear that to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that there was extraordinarily serious culpability or extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the multiple offenses 
 so its a misnomer to say its a mere free crime criterion its free crime plus some further fact 
 thats right and this courts decision im sorry the washington supreme court decision in hughes clearly lays that out if you have any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work in washington i want to give you one other citation to official a new washington court of appeals decision that considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same way that mr burtons was that is to say they are run consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor that case is called state versus washington and it was just reported at N pN d N N pN d N the washington court of appeals in that case considering a sentence just like mr burtons says that it does trigger and violate blakely 
 so the extra fact then is a lot like the sort of heinous atrocious and cruel aggravator i mean its comparable to it 
 exactly its part of the same list and as this court said in apprendi itself that extra culpability which is one of the ways this aggravator can be met is the quintessential type of element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt 
 when you say extra culpability do you mean the nature of the crime suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same time murder rape and kidnapping they are all very serious crimes and if you sentence them consecutively you will take into account that there were three if you sentence them official concurrently it doesnt matter the washington court says we are not just looking to the fact that murder or rape or kidnapping are serious we are looking to sentence consecutively if do you more than that you have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special kind of kidnapping 
 thats right justice breyer in section the current section is section N of the washington code and it says that sentences shall run concurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of exactly the same type the judge is required to find in blakely and if you look at blakely itself remember blakely involved concurrent sentences and so what washington is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently unless theres an extra fact something about the additional crimes that would otherwise be running concurrently that simply requires the judge to go above and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish those crimes separately 
 but could the nature of the additional crimes themselves satisfy it in other words could the judge say well all three it might be one thing if one were serious and the other two were trivial but all of these three are very serious now thats in effect a value judgment not a finding of official discrete fact could that value judgment satisfy the extraordinary criterion that washington says there must be in addition to free crime 
 no it couldnt and the washington decision that i have cited to you will help you with this because it makes it clear that to trigger an aggravator to run sentences concurrently just as under blakely itself there has to be something above and beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes themselves it cant simply be im sorry it cant simply be that there were three crimes committed and all three of them are very serious it has to be something about the crime the additional crimes that takes it above and beyond the ordinary commission of that crime 
 but mr fisher even if its true that there are other examples out there that might qualify for that example its not true of this case 
 im not sure i follow justice stevens 
 in this particular case there was it was necessary to make an additional finding of fact even though there may be cases out there in which you could get consecutive sentences official without an additional finding of fact 
 you are certainly right that in this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact there are some situations under the washington code and i believe in the majority of other states where it is up to the judges discretion whether to run sentences concurrently and he could do it for the reason that justice souter described so what washington does in its respondents brief is it cites these other state decisions from other states that simply have different sentencing systems than we have in washington 
 im not sure i understand that i mean we have not held for example that the fact of a prior conviction is something that has to be submitted to a jury under blakely why if you are determining that sentences run consecutively isnt that just the same as looking at a simultaneous conviction and saying they are going to run consecutively 
 under some state systems that might be the case mr chief justice however in washington the way that the code works is that judges are directed that for multiple crimes the sentences shall run consecutively 
 so youd have official 
 unless they make the exact kind of extra finding and it refers them to the precise same statute that was at issue in blakely itself 
 and you are saying that that extra finding cant simply be that this is a conviction for a particular serious crime thats going to go unpunished otherwise 
 thats right 
 so under this system if you had a regime where if you are convicted of murder and you have been convicted of rape before that you get an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence that would not contravene blakely but if you are convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those two sentences run consecutively you say that that does violate blakely 
 if the judge needs to make an extra finding beyond the elements of either of those two crimes to run them consecutively then it would violate blakely 
 but we have never held that we have never held that consecutive that the treatment of sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by blakely 
 you havent had a case in the official apprendiblakely line of cases dealing with consecutive sentences but what you have done is laid down a rule from the very state that we are dealing with here that says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and beyond the facts encompassed in the jurys finding of guilt for those crimes then those findings need to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt thats why in this case that line that rule is triggered the ninth circuit of course didnt talk about any of this what it said as i mentioned is that it simply took apprendi to be a purely formalistic rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to the jury verdict but it just had to do with whatever the state happened to label as the statutory maximum in apprendi this court said not once but three times that the statutory maximum concept was triggered according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict and like the washington courts the ninth circuit simply ignored that language in this courts opinion lest there be any doubt about the way that concept mapped onto this case this court said in apprendi itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but one of effect does the required finding take a defendant to a higher sentence level than would official otherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed in the jury verdict 
 mr fisher theres another potential impediment in this case and i would like you to comment on it that is the petition from the sentence it was second in time there was a prior petition that challenged just the conviction and under the governing statute to have a second petition you have got to get permission from the court of appeals and it has to meet stringent criteria how do you get past that you went out concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence which is a second petition 
 this is the very first petition that mr burton has filed against the N judgment he did file earlier a petition against the original judgment of N in the joint appendix at page N that is where that petition is reprinted he says quite clearly that he is challenging the N judgment in that petition whereas here this is his first petition against the N judgment 
 so did then you are bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case which is not the sentence you are saying theres an earlier judgment and looking at it as we would as if it were a official civil case if you have a determination of liability that doesnt give you a final judgment the judgment will come at the end of the case when damages are determined 
 thats right justice ginsburg and if what the state is saying is correct which is to say that we dont have any judgment at all until the sentence is final then all you get from that is that mr burtons first petition should have been dismissed and the court could have gotten it dismissed but we submit what you cant do from that is retroactively change the first petition that he explicitly told the court was against the N judgment and that he told the court in that same filing on ja N and ja N that his sentence was still on direct review you cant retroactively change that challenge to the N judgment into one against the N judgment for two reasons one is that if the state is right the district court wouldnt have had jurisdiction under that N challenge against the N judgment either because as mr burton forthrightly told the court that sentence was still on direct review but even if you get past that we submit that this courts castro decision simply doesnt allow a court especially retroactively to recharacterize a habeas petition that official the petitioner himself said was against one judgment as against another 
 so you think there can always be two petitions one of sentences on review 
 no there cant justice kennedy and so what should have happened according to the states theory is that the first petition should should simply have been dismissed 
 bit is that also your theory 
 i think thats this court hasnt laid down a solid decision but i think thats a better reading 
 but are you are you asking us to say that while the sentence is still under review there can be no habeas petition filing 
 am i asking 
 why isnt that up to the option of the petitioner he can take his chances or he can wait 
 i think that is a fair characterization justice kennedy but what mr burton did is he want to the district court saying im challenging the N judgment and as i was saying under castro before that gets recharacterized official 
 im asking if it is your position whether or not he properly can do that 
 i dont think so but im just recognizing that thats a jurisdictional question that this court would decide for itself but assuming that he cant do that what the district court would have had to say is mr burton you are not allowed to challenge the N judgment and lets assume for the moment he could have challenged the N judgment the district judge would have said now mr burton you are only challenging your conviction for the N judgment you need to wait until you are ready to challenge your sentence and then you can challenge the N judgment presumably and this is i think a fair inference especially from the petition itself as it is reprinted since he told the district court that he was challenging his sentence if he was told he couldnt bring it at that time he would have said okay i will withdraw it and wait until i can challenge my sentence 
 but if the first proceeding was not in fact jurisdictionally barred then you would lose under the second and successive objection in this case right 
 i dont know that we would justice souter official 
 why not 
 because it is a common rule that this court hasnt had a case exactly like this but the lower courts do all the time and the fourth circuit case in taylor which i have cited in the reply brief is one of them where it is a common practice for a petitioner to bring one petition against a judgment and then be partially successful and then bring a new petition against something in the new judgment and thats essentially what happened here and it may 
 arent those cases in which the first judgment is complete he simply does not attack everything that was a predicate for the first judgment and then if there is in fact a new trial and a new judgment of course the habeas possibility arises again whereas in this case the first judgment was not complete 
 no you put your finger on it exactly and so but we still think that that either the court had jurisdiction or it didnt and if it had jurisdiction then it must be fall in somehow into the category that you are talking about 
 but thats not necessarily true isnt it also possible if at the time of the official first judgment the judge could have said well you really havent exhausted your remedies because it is not final until the whole thing is over but nevertheless because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter im going to go ahead and decide it 
 could a district judge have done that 
 yes 
 i think what would have needed to have happened here since mr burton at pages N and N of the joint appendix told the district judge im still challenging my sentence on direct appeal under aedpa and customary comity principles the judge would have needed to say you need either to renounce that appeal from the state court or renounce this one you couldnt do both at the same time mr burton if he had wanted to i think it is fair to say could have gone into district court and said i now have a new judgment and im going to challenge my conviction and sentence because i have no intention of challenging my sentence through state court proceedings and perhaps he could have done that but that would be a very different situation than what we have here if i can turn back to the not a new rule official question another angle at this is not simply to look at the text of this courts opinion in apprendi which we submit told a state court in this situation all it would have needed to know but also perhaps it is helpful to look behind that and look at the statutes that were in play in new jersey and in washington and even if you did that it becomes we submit very clear that a district judge any reasonable trial judge that is would have known that apprendi applied here what you had in new jersey was essentially two statutes one that said an ordinary commission of a crime is punishable up to N years and a second statute that said if you commit that crime with some kind of extra extra bad circumstance there a hate crime then you get you can get a higher sentence exactly the same thing was true in washington we had one statute that said this is what the this is what the punishment is for the ordinary commission of this crime and we had an extra statute that said but if you commit that crime with extra bad circumstances and here the only difference was there was a list of circumstances not just a single one but if you commit the crime with extra circumstances then you can get extra punishment and the analogy that the respondents want to official draw between the washington sentencing system and the federal guidelines just simply doesnt hold up 
 so you think blakely was not a new rule but booker was 
 i think thats fair to say mr chief justice because in blakely all you needed to do was apply apprendi which said that if you have two different statutory thresholds the pertinent threshold for sixth amendment and fourteenth amendment purposes is the one that cabins the judges discretion based on the facts in the jury verdict to decide booker this court had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to a different type of threshold which was as this court put it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment so under under the system that this court reviewed in booker you had only a single true statutory maximum and then you had to decide whether the apprendi principle ought to be in play for the federal sentencing guidelines and if there is any confusion on that a trial judge could have looked at apprendi itself where this court and justice thomass concurrence made clear that there was unique status of the federal sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult question however here where you didnt have anything official like that we had just a simple situation where there were two statutes one maximum for the ordinary crime and then an additional maximum for the crime being committed with aggravating circumstances and so it was a very clear map line and thats what this court said in blakely of course it said it didnt break any new ground in the decision in blakely it simply said that took the states argument and rejected it by saying our precedents on this point are clear and it just simply quoted the apprendi language that the statutory maximum for sixth and fourteenth amendment purposes is the maximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts and the jury verdict alone 
 there were decisions going the other way 
 there were lower court decisions 
 yes 
 yes there were and i think if we want to talk about these it is important first to be clear about what we are talking about there were there was a supreme court of kansas that had looked to the relevant language in apprendi and decided that its sentencing guidelines system could not stand and then you had on the other side the supreme court of official washington and the supreme court of oregon and a couple of other state intermediate courts i think some in unpublished decisions that had gone the other way but i think it is very telling justice ginsburg if you want to look at those state supreme im sorry those state supreme court and lower court decisions because none of them not a single one quotes apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of effect and theres several passages in apprendi that said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed based on the facts in the jury verdict so once you take those into account we submit as the kansas supreme court realized there is only one conclusion that you can reach the only way those lower courts were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to pluck out pluck out other sentences of apprendi and not acknowledge the rest of the opinion and of course the rest of the opinion where this court has these passages pages N N are the absolute guts the building blocks of the opinion itself it is where the court canvasses the historical rule that was incorporated into our constitutional system and so it is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or loose language that this court had in its opinion it official was the very guts of the holding of apprendi and we submit that in a teague analysis where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a reasonable jurist would have found something not just the fact that they exist but whether a reasonable jurist would have reached a given conclusion once you take the whole of apprendi into account there was only one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come to 
 i suppose that doesnt make the dissenters in blakely feel very good 
 well justice kennedy i think as i understand the dissents in in blakely the dissents in blakely primarily were saying that apprendi itself was a bad idea and that apprendi really wasnt dictated by the sixth and fourteenth amendments i see almost nothing in fact really nothing in the dissents of blakely itself that says taking apprendi as the law we can distinguish it from the facts in this case there was nothing of that in the dissents 
 of course you have to show that the result was dictated by the prior precedent thats a strong phrase we said it in stringer stringer versus black but if it has a new application thats thats new even though the principle is the official same 
 i think the stringer test is helpful because there of course this court said that one of its prior decisions was not a new rule because even though there was a different state sentencing system that slightly different before the court in the subsequent case the principle from the prior case dictated only one result and i think once you go back to the dissents in blakely and compare them lets say with the dissents in booker on the merits that is in booker i think again it is telling because the dissenters in blakely had nothing to say in terms of a possible way to distinguish one case from the other whereas in booker the dissents did point out we dont have to extend it this far we can limit to it to true statutes and not go this far so there is a difference really what this case i think one way to phrase it in terms of what it comes down to is whether when this court lays a decision down like apprendi that has a clear rule and lots of historical robust reasoning behind it saying why we are adopting a certain rule whether it is up to the lower courts in this case the state courts to secondguess this court and say i dont know if the court really means what it says as justice breyer later put it in the blakely official dissent we think that we submit what this court should say is that when we say something is the law that lower courts ought to assume thats the law at least until we tell them somehow that the law is different if there are no more questions on the new rule i will quickly address the watershed argument because if for some reason this court adopted the states view that really all apprendi was was a highly formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum and that and that just simply labeling courts could have evaded it we think that blakely itself then has to be considered a watershed exception a watershed rule and the reason why is because is because of an error that runs throughout the states brief and the states position is basically that this cant be watershed because apprendi and blakely deal with circumstances where a defendant has already been convicted of a crime and all we are considering is what sentence ought to be imposed but of course that that contravenes the very holding of apprendi and blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury actually found him guilty of and official 
 this argument this argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or not it is a new rule 
 i think thats right mr chief justice 
 dont you have dont you have to address aedpa before we get to that question 
 in the watershed realm 
 in other words it doesnt matter it its a watershed i guess it is a point of argument but it is not clear that it matters whether it is a watershed rule if you read aedpa N by its terms 
 if this court concluded in the whorton case that watershed did not survive aedpa then of course you are right watershed doesnt cant get us home here but as this case comes to the court as i understand it this court is considering this case in a posture that it really dealt with in horn versus banks where it said that even post aedpa what a court is supposed to do is conduct what this court termed a threshold teague inquiry as to whether teague is satisfied and of course in horn this court mentioned the watershed exception itself official so we think that what this court should really do is address that threshold question to the extent it needs to holistically if there are no more questions i will reserve the remainder of my time 
 thank you mr fisher mr collins 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court i would like to begin where justice ginsburg began with the issue of successive petitions we believe that the petition before this court is a successive petition barred under aedpa now my brother mr fisher says that its not a successive petition because the first petition challenged the N judgment but that is simply not correct as a matter of the facts of this case a new judgment was entered in march of N that judgment was entered as a result of mr burtons conviction being affirmed and his sentence being reversed so when he was in custody when he filed his first petition he was in custody pursuant to that official amended judgment 
 so that is the only judgment that could be attacked on habeas 
 exactly your honor so he has an amended judgment filed in march of N he files his first petition challenging his conviction under that petition later in N he files a second petition challenging his sentence 
 it doesnt matter im looking at joint appendix page N date of judgment of conviction he puts in december N N 
 he does put that in your honor but i dont think thats determinative if you take a look at page N on question N they say did you appeal from the judgment of conviction answer yes if you did appeal answer the following and it lays out the facts that he appealed that his conviction was affirmed that his sentence was reversed and then a new judgment is entered in march of N he is not in custody pursuant to the N judgment he is in custody 
 where does it say a new judgment was issued in march of N 
 your honor thats in the joint appendix at page N which shows that official 
 oh i thought you meant it was in his petition 
 no no it wasnt in his petition your honor but it doesnt seem the fact that he was looking back at his conviction original conviction being N and thats what he wrote down doesnt mean that that was the conviction and that was the judgment under which he was in custody because it simply wasnt the original N judgment no longer existed because a new judgment had been entered so because and i dont think i think what we disagree about in this is which judgment if the first petition went to the first to the N judgment and the second petition went to the N judgment then we would agree with mr fisher that it is not successive on the other hand i believe i heard him say that if you agree with us that the only judgment in existence at the time he filed his petition was the N judgment then hes filed a successive petition with regard to that judgment one in december of N dealing with the conviction a second in N dealing with the sentence so since its a successive petition and mr burton did not go through the gatekeeping function that aedpa requires there is no the district court official had no jurisdiction and subsequently we believe that this court does not have jurisdiction 
 the fact is we are looking at page N N of the joint appendix and that is the first petition that was filed is that right 
 thats correct your honor 
 so you look at it and it says filed december N and maybe this is what you said then it says date of judgment of conviction december N N so looking at that youd think that is what he was attacking where does it say hes attacking anything else 
 well your honor it doesnt say hes attacking anything else but the problem with that is that when he filed this petition he was not being confined 
 yes but i imagine there are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the federal system and i would think that judges when they are trying to look at those petitions or the magistrate looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking he has to figure that out often for statute of limitations purposes or some other purpose hed look over there go down and read that line two and hed think yeah thats the judgment thats being attacked official unless of course theres some indication that its something else i have never heard of this before is there any precedent on that where even though the petition refers to date a and theres nothing in to suggest anything other than date a because it turns out that theres a different judgment that in fact hes being held which is date b that the court says oh you are attacking date b is there any precedent that says thats how its read 
 im not aware of any precedent 
 no so this might be the first time i dont see a reason why you wouldnt read the petition thats filed in an ordinary way and say the judgment thats being attacked is the judgment that it refers to 
 well your honor i think you have to say the judgment thats being attacked is the judgment by which hes being confined i mean he 
 i dont know what implication this is going to have for a lot of these petitions i dont know one way or the other but it might be there are thousands right now in the federal official court which have date a and somebody is going to go back and say no it is really date b or something im a little nervous about it if you are not nervous you are the ones in charge 
 well mr collins isnt it your position that number one the only judgment that he can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the time of the habeas proceeding and that is the N judgment that follows the resentencing but he may in attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction which occurred earlier 
 exactly your honor 
 and if he chooses to attack only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the later judgment he has simply in effect waived any other issue and when he comes in later and tries to raise the issue that he could have attacked under the N judgment hes in effect trying to split up his habeas its second and successive and thats why he cant do it 
 thats exactly right your honor 
 and further i thought you told me that the petition goes on to indicate that the conviction while affirmed that the official sentence was reversed looking at N on joint appendix N 
 yes your honor 
 which in other words he details in the petition the subsequent history that would have resulted in a new judgment 
 thats right your honor next i would like to go briefly to the question that justice souter asked about 
 may i just be sure i understand one thing about that so you are saying at the time he filed the petition on december N N he had already had the second judgment had already been entered by the washington supreme court 
 it had been entered by the trial court your honor so he 
 pursuant to the reversal of the 
 exactly your honor that sentence is on page if you look at page N of the joint appendix that is the second amended judgment filed in the superior court in washington on march N N and he was confined under the authority of this judgment 
 of the second judgment official 
 of the second judgment 
 why does it make any less sense to allow separate habeas challenges to first the conviction and then the sentence than it does to allow separate appeals to this court from each of those and once again under the statute we entertain appeals only from final judgment but you can bring here on certiorari the judgment of conviction even though proceedings for the sentence are still in progress 
 well your honor i think we are talking about the habeas corpus statute and there the court 
 a fortiori we have a lot more control over habeas corpus which is an equitable remedy than we do over what is it N our jurisdictional statute under certiorari why does it make any more sense for habeas purposes to insist that he await the final sentence before he gets review of the premise for that sentence namely the conviction 
 your honor im sorry i think that a couple things are being confused here 
 all right 
 the first thing is when is official this a successive is this a successive petition and we would say it is because he filed the first one and then the second one now the question of whether he can get relief under the first under his first habeas petition does not depend on the entry of a final judgment in fact under the facts of this case the judgment was entered in march of N in december of N he filed his first petition and in fact the first petition was denied in april of N on the merits because it had been exhausted he didnt have to wait for that because those claims were exhausted and because they were ripe because they the factual predicates had occurred in the trial court then that was all that was required for him to bring those claims he didnt have to wait for a final judgment 
 but you are saying he cant later bring any claim about the sentence 
 thats because congress in aedpa has declared that you have to bring all of your claims in your at one time and if you dont then your petition should be dismissed as successive unless you go through the gatekeeping solution 
 so that if the statute governing our review had an exhaustion requirement and a official second and successive requirement comparable to the aedpa requirement the case that justice scalia put would be exactly like this case 
 i believe so your honor 
 okay 
 so i just briefly want to go justice souter to where you started about the consecutive sentence issue we believe that consecutive sentence is quite different than from what exists in blakely and that in fact there arent really additional findings of fact i think you referred to about the crime about the circumstances about the character in fact in this case the finding of fact entered by the trial court in order to justify the exceptional sentence this is on page N of the joint appendix finding of fact N if the court were to sentence the defendant to a standard range sentence on each count run concurrently he would receive the same punishment as if he had committed only the rape in the first degree this would effectively result in the free crimes of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first degree because he would receive no additional penalty for those crimes now 
 thats i keep doing official this im sorry is that sufficient as you understand it under the washington case that your brother cited to me 
 i believe it is your honor 
 okay 
 i thought the law was that the sentence shall be concurrent unless and the unless is that the judge makes an additional finding the very same kind of finding that he would make in determining aggravating factor 
 your honor the sentence could have been run consecutively because of an aggravating factor in fact in this case the trial court judge in fact had three independent and separate reasons for running the sentence consecutively two of those would be i think we would say aggravating factors that the blakely reasoning would apply to but the court of appeals when it considered this case only looked at the free crimes element to make that decision 
 maybe you can give me just a little more help on this the finding number N that you referred to says in substance if by just sentencing him on the basis of the jury verdict he wont get he will get a free pass but it doesnt say the judge can could therefore increase the sentence it seems official to me there had to be additional findings that justify a result that he thought would have been a miscarriage of justice 
 no your honor i dont think thats right 
 you think that just having pointed out that he would get a pass would have been sufficient to justify consecutive sentences 
 i think it would and the state supreme court affirmed this decision 
 yeah but he did make additional findings it goes on in fact N and N are additional findings 
 your honor i think i mean i agree with you that he did make additional findings but 
 it nowhere says they are unnecessary either 
 thats true your honor but if you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which is at page N and N of the joint appendix when the court of appeals looks at the sentence what the court of appeals says is nonetheless the sentencing court concluded that the multiple offender policy alone justified the exceptional sentence the fact that the official defendant offender score for rape in the first degree is N thus invoking the multiple offense policy of the sentencing reform act standing alone is a substantial and compelling reason and justification for imposing the exceptional sentence here 
 that is to say that that would have been sufficient 
 exactly 
 but in fact that is not what the trial court premised its decision on because as justice stevens points out it went on in findings N N and N about deliberate cruelty sophistication and planning and so on having been through those findings the court says from the foregoing facts the court now makes the following conclusions of law it seems to me as though the trial court was basing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as upon finding N which was the free crime finding 
 well i think that the 
 i guess what im saying is the fact that he might have im assuming for the sake of argument that the trial court might on the basis simply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced consecutively is simply not the case that we have got because he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on official cruelty sophistication and so on 
 well your honor i believe that the court of appeals felt that that consecutive sentence on the free crimes was standing alone would have been sufficient 
 i dont want to take you up let me just have one on the merits one i mean the reason i want you to get to the merits and i put in my dissent i was trying as hard as i could to show why i thought this case was wrong i start the dissent by saying that what it says and then i quote the two sentences that any fact et cetera any fact that increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum again quote means solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict okay then at the end of the opinion i say until now i would have thought the court might have limited apprendi so its underlying principle wouldnt cause so much harm now the next sentence of course i explain how they might have limited apprendi but somehow that disappeared from the opinion because i guess i couldnt think of it so you are going to tell me now i mean i didnt say how they might have limited apprendi and i official couldnt think of how they might have limited apprendi and they read apprendi to mean what it said now you tell me the phrase i might have put in but couldnt think of that would have limited apprendi 
 well your honor i think that you could have said that the definition of statutory maximum is the traditional statutory maximum that was at issue in apprendi and in fact in the apprendi decision the court specifically i think in response to justice oconnors dissent explained that walton versus arizona was still good law and as you know in walton the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first degree murder but they could not receive the death penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a hearing and it seemed to say that the statutory maximum was death and that in fact the judges findings would not take you above that statutory maximum i think that 
 wasnt that overturned in ring 
 it was overturned in ring your honor but when you had lower court appellate judges looking at your decision in apprendi and seeing the fact that walton and apprendi were consistent it official was logical for them to conclude as virtually every single court did except for kansas that the definition of statutory maximum was the traditional statutory maximum that was in apprendi 
 was it logical for them to conclude it or were they were they expressing the hope that the court would draw a distinction which it had not drawn in the formulation that it gave in apprendi its one thing to say that if you draw no further distinctions apprendi requires a certain result its another thing to say but maybe they will draw a distinction and we are going to predict that they will and hence not apply apprendi werent the other appellate courts to which you refer engaged in the latter exercise which i call the exercise of hope 
 im not sure that i would agree with that justice souter only because as i think justice oconnor explained in her dissent there are two ways to read apprendi and one of those ways would result in upholding guideline systems which are now invalid because of blakely and booker but really quite different from apprendi because those systems involve what you would call guided discretion that is in apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the official judge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was enhanced 
 okay but doesnt that require drawing a distinction that apprendi did not speak to and isnt it still the case that i think mr fisher points out that three times we repeated in apprendi the formula about fact beyond fact found by a jury on the basis of which et cetera the range increases isnt the distinction which and i trust your recollection here that justice oconnor had in mind and that they had in mind a distinction which simply was not addressed in apprendi and would have been something new as opposed to merely an application of what was implicit in apprendi 
 i believe it definitely would have been something new your honor 
 yes 
 thank you mr collins mr roberts 
 mr chief justice and may it official please the court if i could begin by addressing the issues that you were just talking about there was a distinction that the court could have drawn between apprendi and blakely and that reasonable jurists could have drawn and did draw one was the formal distinction that you were discussing before with the state which was supported by justice oconnors proposing that as an interpretation in her dissent and the majority not responding to that that that distinction was contrary to the rule but implausible but in fact accepting the accepting that it was a plausible distinction and saying that it still wouldnt have made a difference that the apprendi rule still was important the second and in addition to that that distinction that justice oconnor drew there was consistent with the apprendi courts distinction of walton and you have to look at what reasonable jurists could have interpreted looking at that decision at the time with those distinctions and what the court said in apprendi but in addition to that there was more than a formal distinction that could have been drawn between the system in apprendi and the washington guidelines system thats the distinction that we proposed in our official amicus brief in blakely and it rested on the fact that sentencing guideline systems like washington try to channel but not to eliminate the discretion that sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise applicable limits and in the washington system the sentencing judge retained a significant degree of discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized to traditional sentencing systems that arent constrained by apprendi the facts the facts on which the judge could rely to go above the guidelines were not specified as in apprendi and as in ring by the legislature but it was a wide open set that enabled the judge himself or herself to determine what facts the judge thought could justify a higher sentence and in addition the facts alone didnt trigger the higher sentence the judge had to look at those facts and make the additional determination that those facts rose to the level of substantial and compelling reasons that justified the higher sentence in that respect the judge had a degree of sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it and whether it was in fact justified now of course this court rejected those distinctions in blakely but the question is whether a official reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions and drawn a difference and we submit that they could have 
 mr roberts do you have a position on whether we have a successive petition problem here 
 we dont have a position on that precise on that particular issue here because it cant arise for federal prisoners but let me explain why it cant arise for federal prisoners because perhaps that will give the court some guidance in resolving the issue in the federal system its well established that the conviction and the sentence are part of a unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesnt become final until the conviction and the sentence have both been fully adjudicated that understanding is reflected in the language of N usc N which is the statute that authorizes collateral attacks by federal prisoners that statute authorizes attacks what it authorizes is motions to vacate set aside or correct a sentence so its clear from that that its not authorizing collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the attendant sentence and i think that could shed some guidance here because N was intended to be a official parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for federal prisoners i would also make a point on the other sort of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the consecutive sentence issue that its not only the fact that the judge said that the multiple offense policy standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence here and that the court of appeals relied on that in upholding that but the court of appeals went further because petitioner had made a separate challenge to and this is on page N and N of the joint appendix petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two aggravating factors petitioner argued that the district court wasnt allowed to rely on excuse me the trial court couldnt rely on those two other aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in the original sentencing and this was a resentencing the court of appeals rejected that challenge and it rejected that challenge because it said the sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense policy alone justified the exceptional sentence and then on page N it said the sentencing court did not rely on the additional aggravating factors for imposing an exceptional sentence so i think these official 
 is that true in fact 
 well that is how 
 im mean im sure you are reading correctly but is that in fact true because having talked as i just read out a moment ago having spoken about free crimes aggravating factors it says on the basis of the foregoing facts i now draw the following conclusions of law 
 the trial court said each of the three standing alone was sufficient but what the court of appeals said is these other two have been challenged but these other two are we are not going to deal with this challenge to these other two factors because they are out of the case so i think that this court has to take the case as coming from coming from the washington courts as if what the courts essentially said is those other two are not in the case any more 
 so we can treat it in effect and this may be the way to do it we can treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the washington appellate court and thats what they said 
 well what the washington appellate court essentially they could have said petitioner is right those other two aggravating factors official couldnt be relied on and so we are relying on this the standing alone what they chose to do is we are going to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on the one and that was the basis for responding to that claim of error and i do think that the court has to take this case as coming on that basis if i could turn to the issue of blakely retroactivity for a few minutes in addition to the points that i made before about why blakely was a new rule i would also submit that blakely is not a watershed rule because its not a bedrock rule thats essential to a fair trial and rules are only bedrock if they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of gideon and blakely doesnt have that kind of importance for three reasons first the right to counsel pervasively affects every aspect of the trial but blakely affects only the procedure for determining the punishment of defendants who have already been found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a crime second a felony trial in which the defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair but its not inherently unfair to use the preponderance standard to find facts that determine the extent of punishment and in fact the constitution permits the use official of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by blakely those include facts that trigger mandatory minimums facts on which a judge relies to sentence within a broad statutory range and even facts on which a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in advisory guideline systems third counsel is so essential to a fair trial that deprivation of the right can never be discounted as harmless error but this court held in recuenco that blakely errors can be harmless and in reaching that holding the court expressly concluded that blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence that conclusion seems to strongly suggest that blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair trial if the court has no further questions 
 thank you counsel mr fisher you have four minutes remaining 
 let me say one word on jurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the official merits on jurisdiction i think mr roberts is right that this rarely happens in the federal system it rarely happens in the state system we cant find any other case where a petitioner has gone in naming as the state would say in effect the wrong judgment and saying im challenging this judgment but what happened here was just that mr burton went in and said he was challenging the N judgment and under this courts castro decision when a pro se petitioner comes in and says im doing one thing in that case making a motion for a new trial it cant be converted into something else which is a first habeas petition without advising the petitioner and here not only was he not advised by the trial court but the state in its own answer which we attached to our reply brief agreed that he could challenge the N conviction and said that conviction is final and he can challenge that judgment the N judgment so its way too late in the day for the state to stand up to you now and say this pro se petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an improper petition on the merits i dont want to elaborate beyond simply just telling this court that if you look at the hughes decision and you look at the washington official decision from the washington state courts it is clear that an extra finding was necessary here even if the only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly too lenient factor hughes makes it crystal clear that a judge needs to find and im quoting extraordinarily serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple offenses and to the extent that the state stands before you now and quotes from parts of mr burtons case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that finding that only reinforces the strength of his habeas petition now that under washington state law the judge needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the judge didnt do so let me finally turn to a discussion about whether this courts treatment of walton and apprendi could have given a state judge a reasonable basis to distinguish the system at issue in blakely we dont think it could because this court didnt simply say in apprendi that walton stands it explicitly said the reason why the arizona capital system as we understand it is okay is because its nothing more than a system that is permissible under williams against new york its one where on the basis of the jurys finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible without anything else and so the only disagreement official between the majority and justice oconnors dissent was as to the way arizonas system worked but any judge that would have looked at apprendi would have seen the majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence that is exactly the kind of system that was not in place in washington so a judge should have full well realized and of course as justice ginsburg pointed out once it became clear to this court the way that arizonas capital sentencing system functioned this court had little difficulty simply applying the apprendi rule and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too and just like the blakely decision itself not even the dissenters suggested that apprendi dictated otherwise if this court has no further questions i will submit the case 
 thank you mr fisher the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in james versus united states mr crawford 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court we confront today the eleventh circuits troubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the armed career criminal act under the text and structure of the act as well as the categorical approach that this court recognized in shepard and taylor florida attempted burglary convictions should not qualify as they these types of convictions do not involve explicitly implicitly or even inherently a serious potential risk of physical injury to another the respondent in their brief has enunciated a test to determine whether a conviction should qualify and that test that they enunciate is basically a district court judge or a sentencing judge uses their common sense and experience to determine whether an offense should qualify that type of test is not the kind of test that this court enunciated in taylor and official shepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at determining whether convictions should qualify the categorical approach that this court enunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of prior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements of those crimes as such the governments argument would open up a is a broad mandate that courts could use to bring in almost any type of crime any kind of felony to be included within the armed career criminal act for instance simple possession of cocaine is a thirddegree felony in florida its a fiveyear statutory maximum under the serious drug offense that congress enumerated it would only qualify if it had a N year statutory maximum and it involved the distribution of drugs yet if the governments approach to the interpretation of the otherwise clause is to be used that simple possession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using their common sense and everyday experience determines it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another obviously 
 if we were looking at attempted generic burglary of a residence wouldnt that involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk of physical injury to another official 
 your honor in taylor this court was clear that under enumerated burglary or generic burglary the offense becomes a has that serious potential risk when the person actually enters the dwelling or enters the structure and under an attempted burglary at least in florida and in most other states that act has not occurred you havent entered the defendant has not entered the property 
 if the wouldbe burglar is climbing through the window or on a ladder with the intent to climb through the window wouldnt that involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk 
 if the conduct again we are looking at then a factbased inquiry obviously some attempted burglaries could get that far other attempted burglaries are caught well before that actually occurs but if you were to say that the attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to get into the place and the person actually didnt get in again under taylor it says the risk is when the person enters the risk is much less outside the dwelling than inside the dwelling 
 but in florida that would be burglary itself right because it covers the curtilage around the house official 
 the curtilage is a unique concept i guess in florida in that the curtilage is the enclosed space around the house that has some kind of enclosure whether by fence or whether by bushes so if the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to the residence that would actually be a burglary within the state of florida in other states it may not 
 right and we dont even have to ask whether that presents a serious potential risk under the statute right because if burglary is identified as a predicate offense without the need to resort to the definition 
 well it would be a burglary in the state of florida but under the test enunciated in taylor it wouldnt qualify because taylor was very specific it is the entering a dwelling or structure and in florida you could be guilty of a burglary without entering a structure or dwelling just like in a curtilage burglary 
 well you could do it in a noncurtilage burglary state simply by putting the ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of the ladder i mean you would have you would have taken a substantial step you would have made an attempt now why would that not qualify under the words of the official statute that referred to a potential risk havent you created the potential for the risk of harm that the statute is getting at when you take the substantial step 
 well trying to use the courts words in taylor taylor talked about that 
 well how about my question first 
 okay 
 i mean havent you in the words of the statute created the potential for the risk when you take that substantial step by starting up the ladder 
 if you started up the ladder and thats the way the attempted burglary conviction came down it would be a lot closer call to say that would be a potential risk whether its a serious potential risk under taylor it is not as clear 
 but you wouldnt analyze it on the basis of whether this defendant started up the ladder as i understand you would you have to analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk isnt that the way it has to be done 
 thats the way that we submit official it has to be done and you wouldnt be getting to those facts 
 no but i thought your argument was that that analysis would not lead to the result unfavorable to your client because the nature of starting up the ladder did not create or could not reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk in other words i thought you were saying maybe i misunderstood your argument that the reason the taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a substantial step which is what the indictment would charge could not be seen as creating the potential risk that the statute talks about now if im not understanding your argument correctly you know straighten me out here 
 i think i understand that substantial step in even taking a step up the ladder mr james would submit based on the language of the statute would not qualify and would not create that serious potential risk of physical injury 
 and thats why simply charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the statute under a taylor analysis as you understand it 
 thats correct 
 but even if it would official thats only one manner of attempt and it seems to me if you are going to do it generically you have to look over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does the whole scope of possible attempts bear i would say a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the specifically mentioned crimes of burglary arson or extortion indeed i guess you have to use the least dangerous wouldnt you say extortion is probably of those mentioned crimes burglary arson extortion or the use of explosives or otherwise involves conduct now that otherwise that refers me back to the crimes already mentioned and i would say that means that the unnamed crime has to have a similar risk at least a risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes mentioned which i would take to be extortion wouldnt you say 
 of those four extortion does seem to potentially have the least risk of all those crimes enumerated but 
 and whats a potential risk by the way 
 a potential risk 
 a potential potential i mean every risk is potential isnt it 
 in the governments in the official respondents brief they talked about how risk and potential and serious some of those worlds potentially knock each other out and i apologize for using that very word but 
 you think potential risk is just risk really 
 i think it is a risk 
 but isnt one way of looking at it i mean i when i read it you know i thought its just redundant but it may very well be that the word potential is in there in order to accommodate attempts 
 if that were true i mean congress when they wrote the statute and in N or they specifically enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that violence so it has an element use of or attempted use of or threatened use of physical force but under prong two they specifically deleted that word attempt 
 specifically deleted or didnt 
 they did not include it and under 
 thats quite official different than specifically deleting it in other words it was never there in the proposal 
 in N actually there was a proposal where burglary would qualify and attempted burglary would qualify that was passed by the senate never passed by the house never enacted so later on when burglary was actually defined burglary was defined as the type of burglary that taylor came close to defining the same way 
 so do i understand your submission to be that putting a ladder against the side of a house to attempt burglary starting up the ladder that that generically does not pose a potential risk of physical injury 
 if that were the only way to prove an attempted burglary within a state if that would be that would be the requirement the legal requirement that you have to put the ladder against the house and thats an element of the offense that to me would be a much closer call but still under the analysis that we have provided the court with the russello presumption it should not qualify but it is a closer case whereas categorically when you look at attempted burglaries the putting the ladder against the official side of the house is an element of the offense 
 we understand from your friend on the other side that an overt act toward fulfilling the attempt is required under florida law in other words its not just enough to have burglary tools in your house 
 correct 
 you have got to take an affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary 
 it is an overt act that is beyond mere thinking about it 
 why doesnt anybody you know count it sounds to me if you are wondering about whether theres a specific serious risk of harm you could find out look at the conviction that in florida for attempted burglary look at the convictions for burglary and see if the harm involved the number of cases in which people are harmed is roughly similar we have all these law professors who like statistics now they like law in economics and everything so why dont they go out there and count and then wed actually know instead of sitting here and trying to figure out something i know nothing about i have never been involved in a lot of burglaries i dont know how the burglaries operate i suspect some people are hurt but rather than my official suspicion why dont we find out what the facts are 
 we are not going to be able to do that in time to decide this case 
 but wouldnt it be as a method of approaching 
 it would also keep the professors from other mischief 
 but what do we know about the dimensions of the florida attempt crime for example you have said it doesnt mean that you possess burglary tools does it mean or does it exclude casing the house walking up and down the street around the block when is a step substantial enough to constitute an attempt under florida law 
 well its not really a step analysis a substantial step analysis it is an overt act its some overt act manifesting your intent to actually 
 what is that concretely its not possessing burglars tools its not casing the place what qualifies as an overt act that would make one guilty of the crime of attempted burglary 
 if you had a diagram of the official persons house and you had burglary tools in your car and you had maybe even called to make sure the business was closed and you were driving there and as you are driving there you are telling the person sitting beside you im going to break into that you know business at N main street that would be enough under florida law to convict someone for attempted burglary of a structure 
 i guess we have to decide how many attempts involve that kind of initial action which doesnt seem very physical threatening and how many of them involve putting a ladder up against the side of the house how do we possibly figure that out to decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of risk from extortion 
 that may be that may be a very difficult question to answer and maybe the respondent had that obligation in the district court because they have the obligation to prove that this enhancement has that substantial or that serious potential risk of physical injury to another and of course they didnt do that but if you look back in this courts decision in N in tennessee versus official garner this court was talking about completed burglaries and it talked about physical violence to a person would only occur in a rare case and it gave the percentage i think of N or N percent of the time but thats in a completed burglary thats not even talking about an attempted burglary whats the risk 
 may i ask you this question it seems to me there are two ways to read the burglary arson or extortion examples that they are clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to individuals physical injury to another or they are put in the statute to say even though they dont involve serious risk these specific crimes will be covered because your statistic of N percent suggests that burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime that presents a serious risk of physical injury but the statute nevertheless defines it so do you read those terms as giving examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of injury or as examples of crimes that would 
 i think it can be read either way although i think even the governments brief in or the respondents brief in taylor talks about extortion and burglary being crimes that can be official committed with no risk of physical injury to another person and yet congress still specifically enumerated those 
 mr crawford if you had that meaning in mind you would not have used the word otherwise you would have simply said is burglary arson or extortion involves the use of explosives or involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk the other purpose of the otherwise which means in some other manner some other manner other from what other from the preceding ones i dont think there is any sensible way to read it except you know in some other manner than these previously named crimes involves a physical risk and that is what causes me to say well whats the least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes and any crime you want to get into this residual category has to be at least as dangerous as that as i have said i think thats extortion 
 using that analysis its hard to figure out but again the government had this obligation or we submit the government had this obligation and they have not shown an attempted burglary to be any more dangerous 
 do you think that official is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a serious potential risk as burglary does 
 in florida or in the eleventh circuit they have determined that conspiracy to commit enumerated offenses do present that serious potential risk 
 sorry go ahead 
 so in the eleventh circuit they have determined that but again we submit under that russello presumption or even the statute itself congress enumerated those four property crimes primarily property crimes 
 doesnt that seem like a fine line i mean if you are sitting around with your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under this provision planning a burglary but if you actually get out there with the burglary tools you put the ladder against the door and you start up the ladder that somehow involves less of a potential risk of physical injury 
 they both present very little potential risk they dont even really under a serious potential risk they dont present that a conspiracy shouldnt either a conspiracy and attempt are not different things because a conspiracy doesnt official qualify 
 you think the eleventh circuit is wrong 
 i believe the eleventh circuit is wrong with conspiracy as well 
 if we dont know and if i cant get too far with the language and i frankly could sit in my office looking at the computer screen i think for hours and i wouldnt be closer to knowing whether there is or is not a lot of injury that accompanies attempted burglary but that is something that is possible to know all we have to do as i said before is count and there are a lot of people who can do that in fact there are people who at least have a mandate to do it and that is the sentencing commission so they have the tools they have the ability and so in the absence on a question like this of my being able to get anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a borderline case where it isnt obvious why dont we as a court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of what the sentencing commission did in the absence of better information from some other place 
 well the sentencing commission when they were interpreting the career offender statute or guidelines they were looking at a official guideline that is worded different than the 
 they are trying to find out the same answer to the same kind of question how many of these attempted burglaries how many burglaries how many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being hurt and as i say i cannot imagine how to answer that question in a borderline case without trying to find the numbers which i dont have here and therefore since i dont have them why dont i look to the best second best alternative which is at least they could get them and i hope they did get them before coming to the conclusion they did 
 well they came to that conclusion dealing with whether a career offender provision should include attempted burglary not under the armed career criminal statute and they specifically recognized that moreover when they dealt with whether they wanted to include attempted burglary they were dealing with career offender which has although it increases the guideline range a person can be sentenced to it certainly doesnt increase the statutory maximum in zero to N year offense to a N years to life offense so for those reasons even if the sentencing commission feels that the career offender statute or official guideline should include attempted burglary that doesnt mean this court should use that for the armed career criminal statute moreover the career offender statute says its only a burglary of a dwelling although the armed career criminal statute says a burglary qualifies if its a dwelling or a structure 
 mr crawford we have held that the named crimes have to be considered generically according to their elements right burglary arson have we ever held that the residual category or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury that that has to be decided generically i mean if we could apply that residual category not generically but according to the crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant has been convicted such as laying a ladder up against the house that particular sort of burglary it seems to me it would be a much easier much easier case wouldnt it wed be able to tell whether there was a serious risk of physical injury is there any obstacle to doing that 
 well taylor and shepard both talk about that predicate offenses under N should be looked at in a using a categorical approach and official the court has talked about that being an approach looking to the elements of the offense 
 was it referring to the residual category 
 it didnt specifically refer to the residual category but even in shepard 
 maybe its not too late to save ourselves from sending out legions of law professors to do studies 
 if the court were to step back and say that the otherwise clause should be interpreted in a noncategorical manner and we are going to the court decides its a factualbased approach in mr james case there are no facts so it may not make any difference for him because theres no facts to indicate what kind of burglary really occurred here 
 you mean no facts in the indictment or charging documents 
 correct 
 but there is in the presentence report 
 that is correct there were facts that were presented in the presentence report that came from police reports 
 you dont have any official doubt that at least with respect to two of the other named crimes attempts would present a serious potential risk in other words attempted arson or attempted use of explosives you concede those would be covered dont you 
 actually no those crimes attempted crimes also should not come in unless theres something about an attempted arson statute that has as an element or something that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another which at least in florida thats not the case 
 dont you think attempted use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion i mean as far as the risk of physical injury is concerned i would think attempted use of explosives is much more dangerous to physical health than extortion 
 getting back to your question maybe this answers part of it although the court you asked justice scalia you asked a question about why cant we make this basically maybe a factbased inquiry and if you were to do so the whole categorical approach that we are dealing with in all the other sections would almost become irrelevant because if something doesnt apply categorically then we will go to a factbased inquiry and that kind of defeats the whole official purpose of the categorical approach 
 mr crawford does the record show that the facts in the psr came from police reports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in the court records 
 the plea colloquy was not ever presented or produced and it does show that they came from police reports 
 where is that in the record 
 i believe that is stated in the psr regarding the facts that they alleged under the attempted burglary which again were objected to specifically the facts werent necessarily objected to but the use of the attempted burglary was objected to and both the district court and the eleventh circuit took that as being an objection to using anything regarding the attempted burglary 
 mr crawford may i ask you a question about the relationship between generic burglary and what florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt and what im getting at is the issue that at least was alluded to in the jones case do you understand florida law on attempted burglary to be as follows that there must be an overt act taken toward entering either a dwelling or a official structure as distinct from an overt act taken to get within the curtilage 
 the evidence i see my time is up little me briefly answer this question or i want to remain or let some remain for my rebuttal very quickly the overt act has to refer to the attempting to enter the dwelling and so 
 so theres no such thing as attempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offense under burglary under florida law 
 under florida law attempting to enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary it is the same thing dwelling is defined as the building or the curtilage 
 okay so when you say dwelling you mean dwelling as defined to include curtilage 
 correct 
 okay 
 thank you 
 thank you mr crawford mr marcus 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court petitioners conviction for attempted burglary of a dwelling under florida law is a violent felony under the armed career criminal act because like the crime of burglary petitioners crime categorically involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another 
 mr marcus do you agree with your brothers answer to my last question that there would be an attempt could be an attempt under florida law simply to take an overt to commit an overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure 
 yes while i would disagree with that but while there are with your characterization but there are no the number of reported cases involving an attempted burglary that involved an attempt to get on to the curtilage if i think based on 
 we dont know basically what florida law is i mean is that the best answer 
 yes i dont i dont think you could conclude they have there is no decision telling you whether that would suffice but we are not official taking the position that it could not involve an attempted entry into the curtilage 
 so that literally i take it then if someone did have a fence around the house and i i i walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn toward the fence with the intent of getting over the fence that would qualify then as you understand it as an attempted burglary under florida law 
 yes it could it could 
 would that be true if i simply wanted to get into the if my intent was to get on the other side of the fence but not into the dwelling for example you know i wanted to steal the apples on the tree 
 well i think 
 would that qualify as attempted burglary 
 i think it could i think but i think you 
 doesnt that give you a pretty tough row to hoe in saying that there is a sufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that qualifies under the act 
 i dont think so your honor i mean florida in the state versus hamilton case we official discussed in our brief florida has defined curtilage narrowly strictly construed the word curtilage narrowly to limit that concept to an enclosed area that immediately surrounds the dwelling and the case discusses a couple of cases from various florida courts of appeals where the courts construed the concept of curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana that was quite a distance away from the from a dwelling house in another case a whiskey still that was a distance about N yards away from the dwelling house that those were too far out to be considered part of the curtilage part of that area that immediately surrounds the dwelling thats associated with the intimate activities of the dwelling so florida and florida and i think the court should take the florida supreme court at its word when it said its going to strictly construe that concept and when it said its not going to construe it to produce absurd harsh or unreasonable results keeping in mind how serious the offense of burglary is so i think the so the first step i think if you dont if you dont believe that the way florida defines burglary is generic in the way congress had in mind i dont think you could conclude that it presents a categorically different set of risks such that it official would even fall outside the otherwise clause 
 there are a number of florida cases that involve open carports how would you apply it there somebody if you had a carport thats not fenced off at all just N feet lets say from the street somebody walks into the carport and steals a garden rake 
 well i think under the current i think under the current statute it has been amended since since N and N and which is relevant the statute is relevant to this case i think now carports are considered part of the dwelling itself the structure itself but under but if it but under the floridas concept of curtilage if the area was not enclosed it was not enclosed by a fence or other structure it would not be considered part of the curtilage and in fact the state versus hamilton case it cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that had found a burglary that took place on a driveway and noted that the court in that case hadnt determined whether the area whether the driveway was enclosed so it does the statute does the concept does require an enclosure and the area immediately surrounding the dwelling and i think it is very difficult to conclude that that that defined in official that way in that limited way that someone whos intending to get on to a residence into the area either in or right around the dwelling that that person is not sort of categorically dangerous kind of person that congress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of the paradigmatic offenses in the statute 
 so in an ordinary city street in miami walking along the street there are a lot of houses and theres a little bit of lawn or bushes in front and theres not a fence because there isnt or there arent fences in many city blocks a person goes up to the house and starts to monkey around with the window to raise it or whatever thats attempted burglary not burglary in florida 
 that yes that is my understanding if it was not enclosed 
 all right so then i doubt then again im left at sea i dont know how often that happens or is dangerous so if i think that this is really a statistical question and i think maybe it is and the government is in the best position they have all the statistics they have whole bureaus over there so what about a presumption against the government in a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a statistical question and the government doesnt have official any statistics 
 well i think i dont think when congress enacted this law that it expected the courts would have statistics available to 
 how are you supposed to decide it if theres a question as there is this instance i think i just dont know how dangerous attempted burglaries are i mean maybe im not supposed to admit there are a lot of things i dont know but there are and this is one of them 
 well there are several things you can do first you can look at the text of the statute 
 i read the text several times 
 congress provided some guidance by setting out four examples of crimes that do present the type of risk they had in mind 
 correct and here i think it might be less than burglary and extortion though one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or something and revealing a secret from the past many such crimes are threats of violence i mean and that just read through the statutes and thats what they are aiming at so i would say extortion is something that official quite often could involve violence but again thats cogitating so i get to attempted burglary i dont know now what do i do 
 well i think i think you have to consider what congresss purpose in enacting the statute congress directed your attention to the serious potential risk that an offense presents i think that just and criminal law requires courts and juries all the time to take into account and to use their common sense and experience to judge the risks that are presented by a particular crime i mean the very concept of recklessness itself refers to a substantial disregard of 
 mr marcus it is a lot easier to do that with respect to the facts and circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it generically you know picking out attempted burglary it is very hard to do that why shouldnt we read this this residual category to refer to the facts and circumstances of the particular crime of which the defendant has been convicted the language enables you to do that the term violent felony means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury physical injury to another official why cant we not not interpret that to mean generic crime but rather the particular crime of which this defendant stands convicted 
 well all that this law has been interpreted for many years no courts of appeals have have construed that it way they have construed it to require a categorical approach and then if you look at the structure of the provision congress clearly with respect to the listed offenses had in mind a sort of a categorical approach that while these courts had sort of looking at one of these crimes on an ex post basis it might not present any risk the idea that these crimes categorically present a potential a serious potential risk of physical injury 
 and would you agree mr marcus that this courts decision in shepard excludes that interpretation if you look at the particular crime 
 well i think the court referred both in taylor and shepard to the to congresss approach and under the statute that sort of that it wants you to take a categorical approach to crimes that are inherently presented 
 didnt we didnt we also go further and say one reason to construe it that way is official we dont want courts to have to be in effect having sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact to establish you know the facts of old trials there was an administrability analysis involved i think there was yeah i wrote shepard and i think thats what 
 there was that as well and i dont think it is beyond the ability of courts to take a crime look at the elements of the crime figure out what conduct is necessary to satisfy those elements and then use common sense and experience to make a judgment about how that the risks that are posed by that conduct looking at the situation 
 mr marcus isnt there this this linguistic problem with the statute anyway because this language if it said that sometimes presents a serious risk then the answer would be obvious if otherwise it said that characteristically presents a serious risk then it might be closer and which do you think is the more normal reading of it i think either is certainly fits the language 
 and either 
 either means sometimes presents a potential risk of physical injury then official obviously they are all covered or if it says characteristically presents the risk potential risk then do you have to decide whether that it is a characteristic of potential burglary that it that it does present this risk or that just once in a while it does 
 no i think its not no i think it has to characteristically taken at a general level the conduct required to commit a burglary of getting 
 if that were true and if as your opponent said that in actual burglaries theres only three percent of them actually involve risk to of physical injury to another then attempted burglary must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent i would think that would that satisfy the characteristic requirement 
 i think it would first of all congress 
 why is it two or three percent 
 the statistics he is referring to came out before congress amended the statute in N and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically official presented a serious potential risk of injury 
 well i dont think thats perfectly clear the otherwise language does suggest that you are right but if the statute instead of saying otherwise had said or involves other conduct that presents a serious risk which i think is a permissible reading perhaps not the best reading but if it said that then it is not you are not taking as a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent requirement but rather that they are eligible whether or not they do 
 well this court interpreted the statute that way in taylor i mean im sorry on page on page N of taylor i mean this court said that congresss choice of language indicates that congress thought ordinary burglaries as well as burglaries involving some aspect making them especially dangerous presented a sufficiently serious potential risk to count toward enhancement i mean thats right in the taylor decision and i think that has got to be the correct reading of the statute because why did congress identify they created two categories of violent felonies the first is with respect to an element of the offense that goes to targeting a person for physical harm the second category are those crimes official that dont necessarily target a person for physical harm but necessarily present inherently present a risk of physical injury to a person 
 that would be fine if burglary were the only thing that congress said there but it also said extortion and i think it absolutely fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically characteristically involves a risk of physical harm i just dont think it does 
 well congress identified it as a violent felony presumably because it believed it had it had the criteria 
 yes but is the criterion characteristically or is the criterion whatever minimal risk of harm there is in extortion 
 well that it carries the potential risk because when any when someone commits extortion there might be a tendency to if there 
 is the level of potential risk the level that exists in extortion right thats what the otherwise refers you to 
 yes to the level of risk thats presented by any of the preceding examples thats correct official 
 maybe the same point isnt it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm in these attempt cases is characteristically going to be pretty close to zero i mean they are not in the house they are just on the ladder in the kind of examples we have been talking about 
 i dont agree your honor the statute directs you to consider the serious potential risk 
 one way to do that is to say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of the harm that comes from the commission of the crime itself i mean there is i dont want to overdo it but the risk of harm to others from the from the step on the ladder is zero if you consider simply the act itself of putting the ladder up against the building and taking the step its only because that creates the potential for getting inside where the risk in fact is measurable i mean we know there are cases in which victims get shot when they appear in the course of burglaries but the risk associated with the mere attempt in isolation is going to be minuscule 
 when you are assessing the risk presented by particular conduct i think you have to official take into account the intent that goes along with that conduct 
 oh i agree with you but the act that involved the act that constitutes the that qualifies for the attempt doesnt involve it im trying to help you here i mean 
 dont believe it for a minute 
 why do you look at the risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of lesser included offense i mean attempts themselves have their own independent risk of physical injury obviously if you have got a ladder up against the side of my house and you are halfway up and i come home theres a risk of injury there even though theres no regardless of whether the person gets into the house or not and i think perhaps theres even a greater risk of potential greater potential risk of injury with respect to attempts because they dont succeed why dont they succeed because something interrupts them and what interrupts them it may well be the home owner so i dont know that you have to look to sort of attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself official 
 well congress doesnt look to attempt as a lesser offense we pointed out in our brief that the vast majority of provisions in the us criminal code punish the attempt the same as for the completed offense and if you think about the purpose of the acca and the acca is not focused on the results of the prior crimes of the armed felon committed it is focused on the risk the propensity that somebody has has demonstrated by engaging in at least three prior violent felonies or serious drug offenses to engage in behavior that is dangerous that presents dangers to public safety so if you think about the attempt and the whole concept of attempt i mean someone who has committed attempt by definition has intended to commit the offense and as you said mr chief justice has only failed by reason of an unforeseen event why would congress in this statute want to differentiate between the frustrated burglar whose only who hasnt succeeded only by virtue of an unforeseen event and the successful burglar i think the serious potential risk language allows you to sort of look at the attempt as you said mr chief justice as virtually the equivalent 
 i would suppose the unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical official injury than the successful burglar 
 arguably i mean if you look at the case law the vast majority of cases the furthest out the furthest case the petitioner can find the most extreme case that hes found involves someone whos in the backyard of a dwelling reconnoitering or casing the dwelling and that was the most extreme example so even with attempts you find in all the case law you do find the physical proximity to the premises and one of the main reasons it wouldnt succeed is because somebody theres the presence of someone who frustrates the entry so that even on that level at that level it is hard to say that theres any lower risk presented by the attempt 
 well what do you say about your brothers argument that the statistics show theres a N percent chance i think it was a N percent chance of violence in the course of committing the burglary i take it there isnt any statistic available if we want to take justice breyers approach about the potential the actual proven potential for violence at the near attempt stage 
 but again i think i dont think you need to have those statistics official 
 no i dont think you do either but i mean i think your whole argument has got to rest really on the potential for harm in the commission of the offense 
 thats the very reason that attempts are prohibited because they present the serious potential to produce the harms that the completed offense presents 
 do i correctly understand we dont need the statistics i guess they are not available but in your view if we did have statistics and they showed that in N or N of N percent of the category of crimes across the nation there was this risk that would be enough 
 for attempts 
 yes well for attempts or complete i mean just say the standard of what presents a serious potential risk of physical injury if N or N of N percent of the crimes whatever the category did present such a risk that would be sufficient under your view 
 yes i think congress wanted to treat a frustrated burglar the same 
 the answer is yes 
 yes they have shown the same official propensity to engage in the conduct that congress was concerned about that falls at the heart of the statute 
 so then its a really easy case because really there is some risk in every case theres some risk that somebody will you know bump into somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least 
 but thats not what we are asking the court here we are asking the court to look at the elements of the offense and to look at the elements of the offense to see whether that creates a situation in which violence is likely to arise here you are talking about this is attempted burglary of a dwelling where you have 
 yes but none of the elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical injury in the burglary case you can have unarmed burglars 
 but in considering the conduct involved in the offense the attempting to get the attempt to enter a dwelling enter someones home someones residence that creates a dynamic situation in which violence could occur 
 right and as i understand your view 
 that doesnt official 
 if in N or N of N percent of the cases there is in fact a physical confrontation thats enough which makes it a pretty easy case 
 yes but again first of all i dont think the statistics would show that i dont think logically they would show that in light of the numbers that are shown for completed burglary but again i dont see with respect to the offenses that are covered that are at the core of the statute i dont see why you would distinguish between the person who tried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen event they have created the same set of risks they have triggered the same set of risks that the successful burglar has 
 so in other words you are saying that in measuring the risk you should consider not just what this particular defendant succeeded in accomplishing but what the defendant was attempting to accomplish 
 thats correct i think the statute permits you to do that with its plain language of focusing on the potential risk of the conduct the serious potential risk and that and also in looking at the rationale for attempts and why we punish attempts in terms of the person is you get punished official for attempts because you sufficiently manifested your dangerousness in the same way as someone whos completed the offense again the state codes the vast majority of state codes demonstrate the riskiness of attempt behavior they predicate felony murder convictions on attempted burglary as well as burglary and as i said 
 what about attempted assault i bet nobody has ever been hurt in an attempted assault 
 well i think my understanding would be that would be covered under the first subsection for the use attempted use or threat threatened use of force 
 all right but it wouldnt fit within your i mean i just wonder what happens when you try to get away from numbers maybe there are a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or embezzlement you know some people get annoyed during an embezzlement and start hitting each other i cant get away from the numbers 
 but there in those type offenses if you look at the elements of the offense theres no nexus between those elements and the a reaction that someone might have just to being official prosecuted i mean thats not 
 so whats the test the test is either a high statistical number of injuries or if not a nexus to a crime that does have a high statistical number of injuries i like the word nexus because whenever i see it in an opinion i have no idea what it means 
 well in this statute you are talking about career criminals people who have committed a number of crimes and have recently just been convicted of being an armed felon and i think thats when you look at that can be your starting point and take so this case doesnt present questions about other cases that might present arguably present or present a serious risk of physical injury but dont necessarily seem to fit with the crimes that are listed and what the crimes that congress had in mind i think thats another case this case falls at the core of the statute we are talking about someone who intends to commit the core crime congress was talking about 
 mr marcus assuming we accept your view about the way the statute should be read i take it you agree that because of the curtilage official possibility under florida law that florida law that burglary in florida is not a generic burglary 
 we havent argued that it is generic burglary thats correct 
 i guess my so that leads me to this question because i mean i my understanding is its not a generic burglary therefore even on your reading of the statute an attempted burglary in florida doesnt necessarily satisfy the prong and its got to come in under the residuary clause of course and because there is a possibility that the only burglary charged was a burglary of the curtilage we have got to dont we have to send the thing back to find out either from court records whether something more than a mere penetration of curtilage was involved here and if so whether whether that penetration carried with it the potential for harm 
 i mean no thats why you have the otherwise clause to cover offenses just as this court said in taylor that they werent 
 no but the only thing we know under the otherwise clause is that this was an attempt at burglary if the burglary were a generic burglary your analysis if we accept it would be the official end of the case 
 yes 
 but this is not a generic burglary therefore we have to assume that the attempt in this case could have been nothing more than stepping across the grass moving toward the fence to lean over to take the apple and therefore dont we have to go to court records in other words dont we have to take advantage of the qualification in shepard and taylor before this case can finally be decided 
 no i mean you have identified an additional step that the court has to consider in deciding the question in this case but that step doesnt necessarily require you to go to court records i mean its our position that even including the curtilage the area enclosed area immediately surrounding the dwelling presents a serious potential risk of physical injury 
 well could you tell us what your position is if we choose to use the noncategorical or the modified categorical approach is there a nexus between whats in the presentence report and some other charging documents or is it just in the presentencing report 
 yes the charging documents are not part of the record in this case the record official right now is solely comprised of the presentence report 
 and we dont have any transcript of colloquies with the court or anything like that 
 no 
 well what about do you think the facts in the presentence report are admitted by your opponent or not 
 he didnt object to the facts in the presentence report he also did not object 
 therefore can we consider them 
 yes 
 so therefore then the question is whether throwing the hammer through the window is sufficient is that right 
 well that would resolve justice souters question about whether it would involve the curtilage at all which would show that there was an attempted physical entry into the residence 
 would you think that the hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do look at the individual case 
 well we dont yes certainly we think that any attempted burglary of a official dwelling presents a serious potential risk categorically but if you didnt agree with that then and you thought that only a subset of attempted burglaries of dwellings would present serious potential risk then clearly this offense here that would certainly satisfy any conception of that 
 because the hammer is thrown through the window is that i just want to be sure i understand your view of the importance of the hammer 
 because there was an attempted physical entry into the residence the person was right on the threshold of the dwelling 
 im still a little unclear as to how much significance we pay to that hammer 
 again we dont think you have to attribute any particular significance to that i mean its our position that categorically this crime is covered and again the case law shows that theres that with attempted burglary cases there is a physical proximity to the dwelling but even if there was 
 even though theres some cases in this large category that clearly wouldnt involve any risk to anybody say the enterprising but careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see official when no one is in the house that thats when he chooses to make his entry 
 thats correct you can always posit under the categorical risk you could always posit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that equally applies to burglary as it does to attempted burglary and so while you could posit a hypothetical where someone trying to get onto the curtilage might seem like it wouldnt present any injuries if you think categorically about people who are trying to surmount get over fences and walls to commit offenses in the dwelling or immediately around the dwelling they are presenting the same sort of risk and therefore the court can conclude that it also within the otherwise clause the burglary under florida law is not so different from the kind of burglary that congress had in mind that it would just drop out of the picture entirely armed felons who have the propensity to go into the curtilage of someones home to either go in the house or right around the house present the very kind of risk that congress was concerned about 
 do you agree that this presentence report cannot be consulted under the reasoning of shepard we need more 
 well under shepard the official defendant in shepard had objected to the use of police reports my understanding is he also submitted an affidavit saying he didnt acknowledge the truth of anything in the police report so i think this case is distinguishable in that there was no objection to the facts in the psr and there was no objection specifically to using the police report as the source for those facts 
 you dont think the psr has some kind of significance that the police report did not 
 it wouldnt no i dont think it would but no 
 is the following sort of summary fair because florida is not a generic burglary state the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy the burglary prong in subsection N but on your argument even though florida is not a generic burglary state an attempted burglary will always satisfy the otherwise prong is that correct 
 argument 
 is that a fair statement of your argument 
 yes if the completed offense is a violent felony the attempt to commit that offense official is also a violent felony thats a fair statement of our position 
 thank you mr marcus 
 thank you 
 mr crawford you have four minutes 
 it seems to me that respondents position is taking the otherwise clause to trump the entire rest of the statute any crime any felony has a potential of violence in fact in footnote N of the reply brief we cited the golden opinion from the seventh circuit and in that particular opinion the court found that serious potential risk for someone who failed to report to a jail because they speculate you know law enforcement might have to go and arrest them and there could be violence in that situation well that happens in all crimes the potential for law enforcement to arrest somebody theres always a potential for violence so the governments position 
 its different when you are dealing with an escapee or someone who has official visitation right and then doesnt report back and qualifies as a escaped felon from prison thats quite a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation 
 but theres still the same potential for violence in either one of those 
 no theres a greater i had this case in the dc circuit theres a greater degree of potential when you are dealing with someone whos escaped from prison than with someone else whos being arrested of course theres always the potential but the judgment was that theres a greater degree of potential when you are trying to apprehend someone whos escaped 
 for someone whos escaped golden wasnt dealing with that golden was dealing with someone who failed to report to a facility after being sentenced to do so the same could be said for someone failing to report to a court for a hearing a bench warrant is issued the same type of risk would be inherent in that type of for that person as for someone who fails to report to a jail upon being sentenced all of those potential crimes basically that would leave open any potential felony to qualify under the otherwise prong congress obviously official couldnt have intended that moreover theres still an issue that was brought up in shepard on the constitutional avoidance how do we actually make these determinations and are these necessarily determinations that were found by the florida court or by the florida system for a florida attempted burglary conviction we submit its not and you are going beyond the mere fact of the prior conviction you are looking at many other components the risk of the conviction which is not the same thing as the mere fact of the prior conviction if there are no further questions 
 thank you mr crawford the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument this morning in N winkelman versus parma city school district mr andre 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this case asks the court to decide to what extent nonlawyer parents of a child with a disability may litigate an idea case pro se in federal court under two distinct theories the answer to that question should be without limitation but i would like to focus today on petitioners primary and first theory which is that parents are real parties in interest in idea suits regardless of the claims being asserted under N usc N a party has a right as a matter of federal statutory law to litigate their own case accordingly when a parent sues under idea it is our position they are suing in their own right and are suing on their own case this is particularly so because the right to sue provision that congress enacted in idea uses the broad phrase any party aggrieved when it allows judicial review of an adverse administrative hearing officers decision the parties agree that it is the underlying administrative complaint or the due process complaint that frames both the claims that can be brought eventually in court and also identifies who the parties are that can appear in court those complaint provisions in idea and there are eight of them in all we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief all eight of those provisions refer unambiguously to the parents complaints congress did not describe this due process complaint that starts the whole dispute process as the childs complaint the childs complaint by and through the parents or the parents complaint on behalf of the child accordingly when a parent files that due process complaint they are the real party in interest and again the provisions make no distinctions about the kinds of claims that can be brought it shouldnt matter that when they get to federal court that or there shouldnt be any limitation on who is the real party in interest in federal court or what claims may be asserted 
 if we say that the parents are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue in their own right is that the end of the case or do we reach the second a second question as to whether or not they can represent the children 
 i dont think you would need a reach a second question justice kennedy its our position that the remedies in an idea case are coextensive and that the rights are inseparable and so this case was pleaded in such a way as to have both the parents and the child be before the court but if this court were to agree with us on our first and primary theory we dont believe it would be necessary to have the child listed as a plaintiff to a future suit and we imagine that on remand the child might be dismissed from the suit its our position that hes not an indispensable party 
 what can the parents get out of this case other than reimbursement for the tuition they have paid to private schools and procedural rights that are given them by the act what can they get out of this case other than those two things that do not depend upon their status as representatives of the child 
 well clearly the relief primarily sought by my clients in fact if you look just at the relief section of the complaint that my clients filed which is in joint appendix page N the only relief they actually seek is reimbursement theres a number of ways 
 what other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the act what other possible relief could they seek that they would not be seeking as guardians of the child 
 of course its our position that parents are never acting as guardians at least in the legal sense or lay representatives of a child in a court action and so therefore a parent should be able to assert any one of the a claim asserting violation of any one of the many rights conferred in the act 
 it depends upon their being a party aggrieved that is defined in blacks law dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy 
 correct 
 now if the only remedies the parents are entitled to in their own right are reimbursement which is at issue here and procedural guarantees why would not their ability to sue or to appear pro se be limited to those two categories youd win this case but im talking about how broad is the rule that you are urging us to adopt 
 well in and this could be a very easy case if the court wants to look just at the specific procedural violations that my clients assert and also the reimbursement claim that they assert but its of course our position also that the full bundle of rights can be asserted by parents i think maybe the best way to answer your question justice scalia is that to direct you back to the definition of a free appropriate public education itself and thats in N and in the statute that definition provides that a free appropriate public education is one thats provided at no cost to parents so if a school district provides a free and inappropriate public education then its the parents obligation or not obligation they have the choice of whether to supplement the inappropriate public education with additional services or to replace the public education with one that provides an appropriate bundle of services so i guess my point is that even in a case where the parents dont necessarily seeks reimbursement they still are intended beneficiaries of the right to a free appropriate 
 the child is the child is entitled to an appropriate public education and the parents are entitled to have it provided free thats really the only interest they have on the table it seems to me separate and apart from their status as representatives or guardians of the child 
 we also believe that the parents have an interest in the education being appropriate for in addition to the reason i just explained that they may have to supplement education but parents are also the coarchitects of the individualized educational program that is eventually that eventually defines the bundle of services that it provides the child and they are integral to the 
 well you say they are the coarchitects i mean are you saying anything more than they are given the procedural right to participate in the hearing 
 i think they are given i havent counted them but i think they are given N N of the N procedural rights outlined in the statute and this court explained in rowley congress placed every bit as much emphasis on parental involvement in the shaping of the individualized educational program 
 isnt there a bit of theres a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they are are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing thats a different question isnt it 
 well typically a parent would file a due process complaint challenging the bundle of services offered by the school district and alleging a procedural violation and so i think it would be a rare case where a parent would by the time they get to federal court try to be a party aggrieved is something that they didnt exhaust that would render the exhaustion requirement 
 they are an aggrieved party for purposes of the administrative process the question is whether that when that is done whether they also constitute an aggrieved party and one of the one of the points made by the other side is that there is an express provision for proceeding without counsel at the administrative level and theres no provision for proceeding without counsel in court so doesnt that suggest that the right to proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process 
 no not at all justice ginsburg congress sensibly recognized that because the process proceedings are run on a state by state basis certain unauthorized practice of law statutes or other laws require prohibiting counsel in administrative proceedings might come into play so congress had to make it express in section N that any party may appear in the administrative proceedings with or without counsel in contrast in federal court theres already N usc N which has been on the books since N as part of the judiciary act that provision allows any party to litigate their own case so it actually makes a lot of sense that congress would have included the express right to proceed pro se 
 which just begs the question doesnt it i mean you are assuming that the parents are a party to the case in federal court 
 well again it is our position that they are because they are parties aggrieved by the administrative proceedings so long as they have exhausted their claims and that this is confirmed in other provisions for example the attorneys fees provision of the statute refers repeatedly to parents as a possible prevailing party 
 i thought it was the unanimous view of the circuits that parents as a general matter do not have the right to represent their children in federal court that the provision of the judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents generally the right to represent children 
 thats correct mr chief justice but our primary theory in this case is not that parents are seeking to represent their children as lay advocates in court our primary theory is that a parent suing under the statute is suing in their own right in fact thats why my clients pleaded this case with as with themselves on the caption and asserted claims that are their own because they believed that those claims are their own and they believed they should be able to litigate those claims under section N 
 you know its not an insignificant matter at issue here counsel who are referred to as officers of the court protect the court from frivolous suits from suits that really have no basis when we give that authority to appear in court and initiate a suit to the public at large we make a lot more work for federal district judges why should we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual result 
 well im not sure that the policy considerations would be relevant to the statutory construction question of whose rights are being asserted in a case like this but certainly under our second theory the public policy considerations would be appropriate it is our position that those public policy concerns about pro se litigants burdening the court burdening opposing counsel are dramatically outweighed by the fact that by the reality that twothirds of the disabled children in the united states come from families that cannot afford counsel 
 the statute already allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party so presumably attorneys can be found to take the meritorious cases and what we are probably dealing with are cases that cant attract attorneys even though the attorneys know that if they win they will get their fees 
 two responses mr chief justice first in other regimes where you have a feeshifting statute the cases are usually still brought by pro se litigants here because you are dealing with a minor child really it is an all or nothing proposition either bring the case and you have the potential to recover attorneys fees or the case doesnt get brought at all and this is borne out by the statistics cited in our position and the amicus briefs from the council of parent attorneys and advocates and the autism society of america 
 was their an argument at any point in this case that the claim was frivolous 
 no there was not and then that brings me to my last point which is as a practical matter there is a very limited private special ed bar and they cherrypick only the best cases but that doesnt mean that all the cases that are left are frivolous or meritless theres a whole universe of cases out there some of which may be quite strong some of which may be on the borderline and some which may be meritless but congress cannot have intended to create this important and robust substantive statutory guarantee to a free and appropriate public education and guarantee all these procedural safeguards including judicial review to enforce it and then expect that that right would never be fulfilled because 
 well if they had that overriding intent it would have been easy enough for them to make clear that this was an exception to the normal rule that parents dont have the right to represent children in court they did that with respect to the administrative proceeding as justice ginsburg pointed out they perhaps conspicuously did not do it with respect to the proceeding in court 
 well actually if i could clarify one thing if you look closely at section N it does not provide that a parent can represent their child in the administrative proceeding it just says that any party may litigate that administrative proceeding 
 i know but N is it N specifically says that parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing im looking at N in other words parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing 
 but thats also our position is they have the right to participate in the due process hearing as parties in fact as the kind of plaintiff side parties and that is confirmed by the provisions that we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief that talk about the parents complaint 
 it doesnt say they have the right to participate as parties they have it says they have the right to for an impartial due process hearing i would suppose if you are trying to figure out who is the party to that case you would still think of it in terms of the child and not the parents 
 well we thought that we believe that congress thought of it as the parents because of all the statutory references to the parents complaint of course we dont take the absurd position that the child could not also be a party to those proceedings but in any event my point was simply that the express lesesne argument that some courts relied on to suggest that congress consciously decided not to allow parental lay representation i mean that argument simply doesnt have a strong foundation because the provision on which that argument is based which is N is ambiguous at best and in fact could suggest just the opposite id like to address a point that respondents have relied on 
 before you do that how much of a practical benefit would it be for children with disabilities and their parents if you are successful here in light of the complexity of the idea and the fact that this is an area where some parents are going to have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional detachment from the litigation if parents can represent their can a nonlawyer parent can appear in court isnt there a risk that in some instances where a lawyer could be found if the parent made an effort to do that they are going to be lured into trying to provide the representation themselves 
 well first of all parents already have to get to know the statute and the applicable regulations when they bring these cases at the administrative level by the time they get to court they are intimately familiar with the facts and intimately familiar with the relevant law the only thing thats different about the court action and the administrative proceeding is now you have the federal rules of civil procedure 
 these disadvantaged parents that you are referring to who comprise the majority of parents they are really up on section you know and all that stuff i find that hard to believe i mean the people you are assertedly benefiting here are the people least likely to have familiarized themselves with the statute and the procedures 
 im not sure we agree with all due respect justice scalia but even if thats true the nature of idea court action i think addresses some of the concern these are not pure record review proceedings like in merit systems protection board cases or immigration cases but they are quasi review proceedings and so what we are advocating here is really access to the courts let the parents whether they are brilliant writers or they are not so good at writing let them at least have access to the courts so that will then a capable district judge can look at the case and decide whether the school should have complied with the statutory mandates 
 and do it right after reading pro se prisoner petitions right youd have a nice evenings work 
 we think that the pro se parents are quite different from pro se prisoners id like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal 
 thank you mr andre mr salmons 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court congress made parents of children with disabilities parties in their own right in administrative and judicial proceedings under the idea and granted parents their own rights under the act one of the rights granted expressly to parents is the right to seek reimbursement for private educational expenses when the parents believe the school has failed to provide an appropriate education that is the claim thats at issue in this case and the parents are clearly the appropriate party for that claim because they are the ones that have incurred the financial harm when they are reimbursed 
 that argument proves a little too much if you have a child who is the victim of a tort for example and suffers a serious injury it is the parents who are going to have to bear the costs of accommodating that injury and yet in any tort action its still the child who is the party and not the parent 
 well i think thats right your honor but the difference here is that the statute in section N and this is on page N a of petitioners brief expressly provides a right to parents to seek reimbursement for the for their the educational expenses that they incur and while the parents have to show that there was a denial of a free appropriate public education we think its clear that the statute makes the claim the parents claim and there are cases for example out of the fourth district in emery that would suggest that it is not even clear that the child would have standing to assert a claim for reimbursement when they are not out of pocket any expenses so we think in a case like this this is an easy case we think clearly here the parents are the parties 
 but then you would be establishing a right for the least needy i mean if they are seeking reimbursement they are able to pay the private school tuition its the people who cant who have no alternative they have to take what the school district gives them because they dont have the wherewithal to enroll their child in a private school and your argument concentrating on the reimbursement right would leave out those people would it not 
 well thats not the sum total of our argument your honor i was just pointing out that actually theres a relatively narrow way to decide this case if the court so chose by focusing on the reimbursement claim in this case our position is that parents share in the substantive right to a free appropriate public education under the act and there are two things we would point to in regard to the definition of a free appropriate public education that we think makes this clear and this is in section N of the act on pages N a and N a of petitioners brief the first is the definition says that the term free appropriate public education means special education services provided quote without charge and at no cost to parents we think clearly the free aspect again is first and foremost a right of the parents because they are the ones that bear the cost with regard to 
 im not following you where is this provision N what 
 i think you quoted from N 
 theres thats correct the definition begins on page N which says free appropriate public education on section N and it says the term free appropriate public education means special education related services that and under subparagraph a have been provided at public expense under public supervision and direction and without charge then in subparagraph N on page N the term special education is defined which is again the term from the definition of free appropriate public education is defined to mean specially designed instructions at no cost to parents and so again the right to a free appropriate public education is defined expressly in part as terms of the parents interest we also think that regards to any question about what is the appropriate if you look back again on N subparagraph d of the definition of free appropriate public education it says that it has to be special education services that are provided in conformity with the individual education program required under the act and now the individual education program or iep process is the process by which parents are given the right to participate as full members of the iep team and to have a say in helping to define what is an appropriate education for the child and as this court pointed out in rowley this is the essential feature of this act the way it works is that congress did not specify or flesh out a substantive standard for what is appropriate for a child instead it ensured it mandated excuse me that an appropriate education is an education that involves parental involvement and when there is a dispute with regard to whether the iep team has adopted the right educational program for the child we think that the act makes parents who again who are full members of that team when their views are rejected as far as what is appropriate they are given the procedural safeguard of initiating a due process hearing again the act refers repeatedly to 
 so their their rights so their right to proceed in federal court should be limited to the rights that you have identified under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on behalf of the child 
 thats correct 
 in other words you think you think their their their rights the rights they can assert are only ones they can identify as their own as opposed to the childs 
 well it that is essentially our position although i would add that our position is that all of the rights of the statute are rights that are shared by the parent at least with regard to the substantive 
 well then you still havent said anything i thought you were saying that they can sue for the money and they can sue for denied procedures but if all the procedures are given and they are still not satisfied with the public education that is given they would not be able to sue claiming that it was inadequate under the terms of the act you think they can sue then too as well 
 yes your honor we do 
 well you havent said anything then 
 well 
 you really havent limited the scope of the parents right to sue at all 
 well well just because i havent limited the rights of the parents right doesnt mean that i havent been trying to make a point about how to interpret the statute the statute we think does not limit the parents rights to sue on behalf of their child and on behalf of their own rights under the statute we think the way to think about this again keep in mind that the right to initiate a due process hearing and the right to seek review of that in court those are rights that are contained in section N which is the procedural protection the procedural guarantees of the act and we think those are rights that belong to the parents 
 fine you have given the procedure but where does the act guarantee the parents the proper outcome the proper assignment 
 well we think the way 
 it does give the parents the right procedures explicitly and the rights to reimbursement for for private tuition 
 the that thats correct the way we look at the question your honor is to say it gives the parents those rights it gives the parents the right to be full members of the iep team that determines the appropriate education for that child while the school district has the final say as far as the contents of the iep the parents as members of that team have the right to initiate litigation through administrative procedures and then ultimately in court if their view of what is appropriate for their child is rejected by the by the by the iep team and while and no doubt 
 and that right where where is that right contained you have given us citations for the other ones where is that right contained 
 the right to initiate 
 the right to initiate a suit solely on the basis not that i was denied procedures not that i i paid money for private schooling but i do not believe the outcome the education given to my child in the public school was enough 
 your honor what i would refer you to are the many provisions of the act and you can turn to pages N a and N a for example of petitioners brief that has these in part where the act repeatedly refers to the parents due process complaint the parents due process complaint known as the parents right to a due process hearing the N amendments expressly refer define prevailing party to be parents it referred to the parents cause of action 
 they have the right they have the right to the hearing but do they have the right 
 they have a right 
 do they have a right in and of themselves not as guardians do they have the right to a particular outcome in the hearing thats thats the point im inquiring to 
 our way of looking at the statute your honor says that if they are the ones that initiate the hearing they file the complaint they are parties to that hearing then when when their claims are denied they are parties aggrieved within the meaning of the statute its the same term parties aggrieved that refers to the right to an appeal in the administrative process that refers to the ability to initiate a civil cause of action 
 it is not it is not just party aggrieved its party aggrieved by the findings and decision as opposed to party aggrieved by a denial of the procedural right and those strike me as two different things 
 well i does say it does reference back in fact it references back to the complaint thats filed to initiate the due process hearing and the parties are the ones that excuse me the parents are the ones that are referred to as the ones filing those complaints it is referred to repeatedly as the parents complaint and the parents are are referred to as prevailing parties in the civil action again in the attorneys fee provisions that were added in N expressly refer to quote the parents complaint or subsequent cause of action this is on page N a of petitioners brief and it refers to parents as a prevailing party there are other provisions that do so as well and while we are on the topic of the N amendments i see my time is up 
 thank you mr salmons mr bergeron 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the common law rule banning parental pro se representation is as longstanding as it is pervasive appreciating the fact that the idea does not abrogate the common law rule petitioners instead seek to circumvent that through this substantive rights theory if a due process complaint never raised any issue of parental substantive rights nor even did their cert petition which at page N said children had substantive rights but parents have procedural rights now however they tell this court that the right the parents substantive right is so ingrained in the fabric of the statute that the courts should recognize it 
 how do you classify right to reimbursement 
 your honor i would classify that as not a right its a remedy it is a remedy premised on the denial of the fape to the child and as a result it is simply a derivative claim for the parents to recover those funds 
 the right to recover money its just a remedy its not a right 
 thats and thats how N is structured the provisions about reimbursement it depends upon the predicate finding that the child was denied a fape and therefore one of the remedies among other remedies compensatory education and so forth is reimbursement 
 what about the provision that says at no cost to the parent 
 your honor certainly that has been one of the emphases by petitioners but the response to that is that the free aspect of the free appropriate public education does not give parents a substantive right to the education itself we are not talking we are debating in this case the merits of this case we are debating the a aspect the appropriateness we are not saying we have not expelled the student and therefore they have a claim based on that it is simply 
 why dont we go back to my other question to be sure i got your point the reimbursement is paid to whom 
 your honor 
 the child or the parents 
 our position is it would be paid to the child the child would be the party that could bring that claim and i just would like to clarify if you look at page N of the 
 you reimburse the child for money that his parents spent 
 and your honor that is how the court lower courts in the third circuit where the collinsgru rule prevails thats how they apply it 
 what would what would happen if the child were deceased or incompetent 
 well that is that is exactly the scenario in the seventh circuit case that they cited in N and they said its the childs estate is the one that brings the claim now in that case the child had actually expended the funds but that case upheld the rule that we were advocating here 
 in an instance in which the money is paid to the the reimbursement is paid to the child how does the child get the money to the parents 
 you have got to assume 
 maybe maybe these children dont do they set up trust funds for these reimbursements 
 your honor i think it is no different than a basic attorney fee award theres not theres not a claim that that you know if someone else if the uncle pays the attorneys fees that didnt negate the award of fees on behalf of the child 
 no im not talking about negating the award im if that theory is sound if the child is the proper recipient of the reimbursement i presume that ultimately the reimbursement is supposed to go to the person who paid the money 
 thats right 
 which would be the parent my question is how does the child in that case get the money to the parent 
 well because the claim would have to be brought on behalf of the child because they would not have the capacity to bring the claim itself the award would go straight to the to the guardian who may be the parent that is proceeding on their behalf 
 but the guardian cant the funds that belong to the child 
 well but your honor we believe that thats the pragmatic result that congress intended here 
 all right but if the if the guardian is in a position to convey the money to himself in the different capacity as the parent then why isnt the guardian equally in a in a position to be substituted for the child in in litigating the action 
 well your honor 
 you cant have it you cant have it both ways 
 well the guardian can certainly bring the claim on behalf of the child but its different than bringing the claim in their own right and i would point that at page N of the joint appendix it specifies at the at the administrative hearing level there was no claim for reimbursement to the parents in fact what they were seeking was reimbursement to monarch to the school in other words as far as the administrative record disclosed they had not actually paid the funds 
 what is this to do i mean im im puzzled about why we are talking about this complicated thing i mean why the statute as i read it has a section and its called procedural procedural rights 
 yes 
 and it says that the procedural rights right at the beginning are for both the children and the parents and it sets up some procedures in the agency which is for the children and the parents and school board and everybody is supposed to be there and then another part of the same section says any person aggrieved by the first has a court hearing why isnt that the end of it its clearly aimed as the statute is aimed at both students and parents and then we give them all procedural rights and what in the statute says that the procedures that they are following before the school board happen to be for both parents and students but without saying a word a different procedure a federal court procedure in the same section without saying anything would be just for the students and not for the parents i mean i find that hard to read the statute that way 
 well your honor if you are talking about the distinction between the procedural and the substance in the act congress made clear 
 no im not im talking about the whole act throughout the whole act they talk about parents and students 
 right 
 and who writes the check the student 
 generally no your honor 
 no of course the parent writes the check and has the interest i have an interest in educating my children as you do in yours and this statute talks about that throughout 
 just 
 so im looking at the particular words in the procedural section and the particular words explicitly say that every subsection is both for parent through child and then we get to the court one and it talks about person aggrieved and you i guess have to convince me which as im putting it sounds like an uphill battle 
 but you have 
 i will do my best 
 you have to convince me that person aggrieved at the at the end of this section is meant to apply to only some of the people whom every other section talks about namely just children not parents now why should i read that it way 
 well let me try to explain justice breyer the reason is as petitioners effectively conceded in their reply brief party aggrieved does depend on the party entitled to the remedy and if we look at the amendment in N which was just added in N it clarifies that all relief that the hearing officer should award is based on substantive violation to the child and its important that if we look to the entirety of subchapter N there are more than two dozen references to the right to the obligation to the provision of a fape to the child that is what we are talking about the dispute resolution provisions hinge on vindicating the childs right and i think the question earlier to mr salmons was 
 whats that section you just alluded to im blasting by it where is it in the 
 im sorry which section 
 f 
 oh N (e im focusing on N a of the blue brief your honor and once that section 
 N a or 
 N a of the blue brief your honor 
 and which is the statutory section again 
 its N 
 i thought you said N 
 are you sure its not N 
 is on N a of my version of the blue brief your honor thats the provision thats titled decision of the hearing officer and provides that the hearing officer should grant relief on substantive grounds 
 its in N of mine too maybe i have a different brief there 
 thats not my brief your honor i apologize in any event it limits the hearing officers ability to reward relief based on the substantive whether the substantive right to the fape has been awarded or not and then we return to justice breyers point about the party aggrieved the party aggrieved by the finding or decision because the decision is limited to substantive grounds that is what we are really talking about here and i think one of the confusing aspects about what the nature of the substantive right is and i think we have heard some different versions of that this morning is what is the scope petitioners in their reply brief seem to try to retreat a little bit and make the rights more palatable but if they in doing so the question is what is the right different than the childs right and we simply do not have the answer to that and for the school districts applying this act on a daily basis and for courts interpreting it it simply poses numerous problems trying to apply to a parent a statute that was designed to benefit children 
 your argument i guess is this argument now you are conceding the parent does have a right to go to court but he can only complain about something that hurts him right 
 i would not 
 he cant complain in court or well it sounds as if you were saying that you are saying that the hearing officer has to decide against the parent and if he doesnt decide against the parent obviously the parent cant go into court because he doesnt have anything to complain about the parent isnt that your point 
 well he cant decide against the parent because the only issue at stake is the right of the child 
 oh well right im sorry then you go ahead i thought i heard you say that the problem is that the parent didnt have a right taken away by the hearing officer and thats why the parent cant go to court 
 well he wont have a right taken away from him because its not its not his claim at stake in the due process hearing 
 oh i would agree we can be on the same grounds there 
 right 
 i agree that if the parent isnt hurt if the parent wasnt deprived of anything the parents can go to court but doesnt have anything to complain about you know whereas another section of the statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to be reimbursement for the parent so it would seem as if the panther has something to complain about isnt that so it says the i think so it says a parent is to be reimbursed i thought that was one of the things that 
 thats correct your honor thats what it says 
 so now it looks as if the parent has something to complain about the parent hasnt got the money that he was supposed to get now we have something to complain about so therefore we are aggrieved and then the last section says an aggrieved person can go to court 
 right we simply feel that because the reimbursement as i said before hinges on the deprivation of the right to the child and not the deprivation of the substantive right to the parent it is the childs claim to bring i appreciate 
 mr bergeron i have a basic conceptual problem both with that response and with your larger argument leaving aside how we should classify the reimbursement right or classify reimbursement you make a broad distinction between the substantive right of the child to the free appropriate public education and on the other hand the procedural rights of the parent in going through the process that ultimately comes to a conclusion for the childs benefit the conceptual problem i have is that i dont understand why it makes sense to say that the parents have procedural rights unless that procedural or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents we give procedural protection to people in order to vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim and you are in effect splitting those two apart you are saying one person has a substantive right the other people have procedural right and i dont see conceptually how you can make that split and if you dont make that split then it only makes sense that the right to the free public the free appropriate public education is as the statute in one place seems to say a right of the family group the parents and the child together rather than the right of the child alone so conceptually how do you defend the distinction that you make between substantive rights on one person and procedural rights in another 
 and heres how i would explain it justice souter the right the substantive right is the right to a fape to the child and because the child does not have capacity congress implemented a pragmatic system to allow the parents to protect those rights its derivative for the parent to protect the childs right 
 then why dont we say that they are the procedural rights of the child and the parents are simply stepping into the childs shoes to vindicate them 
 that is exactly what N says your honor that allows a transfer of rights and N is at N a and N a of the red brief and i hope i have got the cite right this time N allows for states to require and ohio does to require the transfer of all rights under subchapter N that a parent would otherwise have straight to the child so basically 
 but thats when the child reaches majority 
 thats right 
 the child is no longer a child the child is an adult 
 and thats my thats part of what i was trying to say 
 im sorry you go ahead 
 oh well what im trying to say is because the child lacks capacity they cant do all these things on their own until they reach majority but once they do and the rights transfer it illustrates that its not really the parents rights it is the childs right that they are protecting 
 what if what stands in the way of that analysis is the text which says all other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter transfer to the child not only doesnt that help you it seems to me it hurts you it acknowledges that there are rights accorded to parents 
 right and those would be the procedural safeguards that are delineated in the act 
 but then you were denying them as i understood the argument 
 well let me clarify then i wasnt denying the existence of the procedural safeguard to the contrary what im saying is that they are not redressible independent of themselves in federal court unless and this is what N clarifies is that you have to have a substantive violation because if you think of a situation in which the child is provided a fape no one disputes that but a parent says well you didnt invite me to a meeting whats your remedy there there is no remedy and thats what congress was trying to clarify 
 isnt that the problem on the analysis that you are coming up with parents end up without even the procedural rights because you are saying the only person who can basically invoke a violation of procedural right is the person whose been denied the substantive right the parent hasnt been denied the substantive right therefore the parent cannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly on your own analysis the parent has been given that cant be correct 
 your honor if you look at i will direct you to the dibuo case and the lesesne case im probably mispronouncing both of them 
 no but before you direct me to cases 
 okay 
 whats wrong with the analytical point that i just made 
 well your honor the thats what congress was trying to clarify in N they did not want technical procedural violations to eclipse the substantive rights and so what they provided was the substantive right is the only one that is important 
 yeah but instead of saying they are not eclipsed you are saying they are totally blocked out because you analysis i thought was in response to my earlier objection that the procedural right in fact can only ultimately be invoked for the vindication of the substantive right and because the substantive right is the childs not the parents it would follow that the parents cannot even invoke their procedural rights and we know that that cant be correct 
 right and im not saying that the parent the parents procedural rights are gone i mean remember 
 but if the parents procedural rights are not gone then the parents must be able to invoke those procedural rights based on what they claim to be a denial of some substantive entitlement you are saying thats the entitlement of the child but if the parents are going to have any procedural right worth having they have got to invoke it for the purpose of vindicating that substantive right isnt that correct 
 yes 
 okay then why do not the parents when they are claiming that they are aggrieved have as much right to make a claim that goes to the substantive denial as to the procedural denial simply because the two are inseparable 
 your honor because that again that was what congress was trying to clarify in N and if you look at the dibuo case and the lesesne case cited on page N of the sgs brief both those cases make clear that notwithstanding procedural violations there must actually be a causation there must actually be substantive harm before any relief can flow from that 
 does a parent have a right to bring a N action if their procedural rights under this statute are interfered with by the state actors 
 your honor if the parent would otherwise have a N claim under N if it relates to an idea claim there would have to be exhaustion first 
 i think i understand your argument based on N but when i look at N a of my blue brief theres another provision on attorneys fees and its phrased in a very curious way it says that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability it seems to me thats the most difficult express language for you to deal with it doesnt say attorneys fees happen to be allowed to parents its to a prevailing party who is a parent and i understand your argument to be that a parent can never be a prevailing party 
 thats right and let me try to explain why if you look at N which is N a of the red brief and im sorry to keep jumping briefs on you that provides that litigation brought to secure the right of the child to a fape is brought on behalf of the child so congress added both that section and the section you were just referring to at the same time and the only way to read them harmoniously is that any action that is being brought on behalf of the child to secure the fape its not the parents own action that they are bringing they are bringing it on their own on behalf of the child 
 what was the section you cited 
 N on N a of the red brief 
 yes 
 legal fees the disbursements under subparagraph shall not support legal fees court costs or other costs associated with the cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a disability to ensure a free and appropriate public education for such child what do you think that proves 
 what im saying is congress recognized that when legal action is being brought to secure fape just like its the childs right to the fape under subchapter N it is being brought on behalf of the child and thats where petitioners run into problem with the common rule law because the common law rule that they dont dispute is that parents cannot bring claims on behalf of the child pro se so they have to find a way to abrogate and they initially argued in the opening brief for an exception to the common law rule which from my reading of the reply brief they have abandoned so the core issue in dispute as far as the petitioners go is what is the nature of the substantive right and id like to make the 
 theres a section you pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph but your brief doesnt include subparagraph 
 its the high cost one of the high cost funds for states justice ginsburg id like to make 
 well then if this provision is limited to subparagraph how can you argue that it covers the waterfront 
 well your honor i think its indicative of what congress appreciated the claim would look like on any level and its not simply saying that those funds arent provided under subparagraph that is the nature of the claim regardless of under what section we are looking at that is the nature of the claim that could be brought in order to secure a fape for the child and in every circumstance it is brought on behalf of the child your honor id like to make one point if i can about the spending clause in response to petitioners argument in the reply brief petitioners effectively say that the spending clause doesnt apply because this is not an issue of liability id like to direct your attention again to rowley where at footnotes N and N the court recognized the difference between the educational benefit which is the fape and maximizing the educational outcome 
 are attorneys fees allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases on behalf of a child pro se 
 no 
 its a convoluted question okay so theres no issue under the spending clause that a nonattorney parent would be able to claim some sort of attorneys fees 
 thats what i think there have been four circuits who addressed that in the context of attorney parents and they have all said that they cannot get fees 
 so how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards 
 well arlington did not limit it to simply liability it said repeatedly obligations and conditions and thats exactly what rowley was looking at in footnotes N and N we dont necessarily have have to have a line item that theres going to be x dollars in damage it was simply the difference between an educational benefit and maximizing that benefit that triggered spending cost concerns in rowley just like in south dakota v dole the issue of whether someone was N in order to consume alcohol was not necessarily a liability but it was a very important obligation or condition imposed upon the state and their second point regarding the spending clause is that not every single detail needs to be fleshed out in clear notice 
 so i take it your argument is your red brief argument is that congress said states if you get some judgments against you and they award attorneys fees you pay for it we wont is that what it said 
 no 
 you dont pay for it you cant pay for it out of the grant 
 right 
 okay so we are not paying for this you pay for it is that right 
 im sorry 
 states 
 right 
 if some people bring claims against you under this because you didnt have a good plan for the child and your attorneys fees are awarded against you dont pay for it out of this grant isnt that what you are saying it says 
 well your honor its a little bit different because part of the part of the real issue here is not necessarily an award of attorneys fees to the other party but its the incurrence of attorneys fees defending 
 i thought what your argument was and if its not forget it its just that i dont understand it that here the government says pay for this out of your own pocket and then its defines what you are supposed to pay out of our own pocket is as a parent representing a child not his own action and then later on they say they define it differently they talk about prevailing party the parents of the prevailing party but you say that second phrase must mean the first phrase because it wouldnt make sense for the government to say pay for that out of the grant but not this out of the grant thats your argument 
 and i think thats right 
 okay it is an argument 
 and and just to clarify congress hasnt provided any funds for this i mean they they recognized in N they were only funding N percent of the obligations of the statute and we have to pick up the balance of the tab and their other argument on the spending clause is that its you dont have to flesh out everything in the statute but here we are talking about two core issues one is abrogating the common rule law and the other is creation of substantive rights to an entirely new class of beneficiaries if theres ever anything that demanded clear notice this is it it is much more serious and severe than the expert fees at issue in arlington and school districts and states simply have to have notice what is the parameter of the right that you are being requested to recognize and based on the briefing and based on what we have heard in argument it is simply not clear to the school districts not only what the nature of the right is but how to apply it 
 well thats where i have a little bit of trouble its not the underlying right is still the same its the right of the child to a free and appropriate public education and that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys who get their fees paid if they prevail and all we are talking about is a situation where the parents can assert that same right when an attorney wont and im just wondering how significant additional exposure we are talking about and what turns on that is whether to take the spending clause argument seriously or not 
 well and i think the answer to that is its still not clear to me from from listening to the argument today i mean petitioner acknowledged the child falls out of the equation this is a statute that needs to benefit the child and they are taking the child completely out and so what is the nature of this parental right the sg says well its all its all intertwined but if we look at what petitioner said 
 so if you agree we are talking about what is the toll on the states it seems to me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer if it lost and that parents who brings the case is not entitled to reimbursement how is the states pocketbook affected 
 justice ginsburg in litigating this case while the winkelmans were pro se we expended far greater than the $N at issue in arlington on our legal fees defending 
 right but you would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to take the case what what your spending clause argument is the state agreed to undertake this liability that they would have to provide a free and appropriate education that if they litigated they would have pay the other sides attorneys fees but if they knew that in the case where an attorney wouldnt take it the parents could prosecute it and that might result in overturning their decision and that might result in greater expense well in that case they would not have bought into this deal at all that seems a little implausible 
 well mr chief justice remember at the time the congress reauthorized in N every circuit that had addressed it besides the first had agreed that parents could not bring a pro se so the states reasonably would not have believed especially in the circuits where it was decided that they would have to have to come up with these funds 
 im not disputing that it results in additional exposure im just disputing that it affects the voluntariness of their agreement to undertake the program 
 well if you in the dissent in arlington they made justice breyer made a basically materiality argument and the majority did not seem moved by it so i think this is something that is very significant not simply on the dollars involved but how we apply this substantive right to parents that petitioners seek to have recognized 
 could the court appoint the parent guardian ad litem and just the parent proceed as guardian ad litem 
 that wouldnt solve the issue of under the common law the guardian ad litem would not have the ability to receive pro se on the common law fees the same as the parent the rule is the same so they would still have 
 the guardian ad litem cannot proceed pro se 
 thats right unless they are unless they have unless they are an attorney which in many cases the appointment to someone who is an attorney 
 mr bergeron on one of the points you made on the spending clause argument i thought was that if there are lawyers representing the parents the lawyers are going to screen out the more frivolous cases if they are not more frivolous cases are going to be brought and theres theres an intuitive appeal to that argument do we have any any figures on the comparative numbers of frivolous cases in lawyer representation and pro se representation under the act 
 justice souter we dont because most of the circuits were saying this is we are not going to allow pro se 
 we dont have any first circuit numbers 
 no 
 versus other numbers 
 no we checked and couldnt find anything your honor 
 okay thank you 
 thank you mr bergeron mr andre you have three minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice i would like to turn briefly to respondents assertion that petitioners somehow waived their claim to reimbursement by not exhausting it below we addressed this in our reply brief but if the court wishes to look at pages N and N of the joint appendix particularly page N there it is clear that the petitioners were seeking reimbursement in their own right on the page N that respondent refers to i assume that that point in time we were now on appeal to the second tier of the ohio administrative proceeding and perhaps at that point in time monarch school was actually paying for jakes education on a grantlike basis because that was something that happened in this case and that perhaps at that point in time petitioners referenced reimbursement to monarch because monarch had actually been expending the fund but by and large my clients expended the funds to educate jake at monarch school and they certainly did exhaust that claim to reimbursement 
 are you claiming that hiring an attorney would be a cost if the phrase at no cost to the parent if they have to hire an attorney that the cost 
 certainly and i mean i think thats why congress included the attorneys fee provision in N that recognized that parents can be prevailing parties and if they prevail on establishing that a free appropriate public education has not been provided then they can recover attorneys fees as part of their their right to try to vindicate congresss purposes at no cost to them 
 so why didnt congress just add the provision making this very clear that the senate had passed why did the house boot it out of the conference bill 
 we dont know the legislative record is entirely silent but one plausible inference could be could be reached based on looking at the addition of attorneys fees provision and the timing of the maroni decision in the first circuit maroni came down after the parental lay representation provision was proposed by the senate maroni was the first court of appeals case to recognize that parents may litigate these cases pro se the way maroni did it however was by adopting our primary argument here today which is that parents possess the right to to sue in their own name as pro se litigants not as lay representatives of their children and seek to enforce the full bundle of rights congress very well could have looked at maroni and said aha thats what we intended all along maroni got it right and then they just put congress just put the thumb on the scale a little bit by enacting the attorneys fee provision which made it clear that parents can be or are the prevailing party if the plaintiffs prevail in an idea action finally i would like to address two two points about the spending clause of course we believe the spending clause is totally inapplicable but i want to respond to respondents suggest that we are advocating creation of a new substantive right here 
 why do you think its totally inapplicable 
 we think that this courts spending clause jurisprudence is concerned with providing clear notice to states with respect to liability and certain fiscal obligations and what respondent is complaining about here 
 please 
 oh what respondent is complaining about here is essentially a disparate impact and this court has never recognize a disparate impact claim under the spending clause 
 so you think it is not violated not that it doesnt apply for some reason there is no doubt this is spending clause legislation right 
 well absolutely spending clause legislation but we believe that the clear notice concerns of the spending clause are not even implicated but that if the clear notice concerns were implicated the statute is clear 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first today in marrama versus citizens bank of massachusetts mr baker 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court section N of the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor may convert a case under chapter N to a case under any other chapter of the bankruptcy code at any time if the case has not been converted previously from another chapter and that any waiver of the right to convert a case under the subsection is unenforceable other subsections of section N give rules for the court to decide about conversion in the case where some party other than the debtor requests conversion of the case and also provides that the conversion must lead to a chapter to which that debtor is qualified to be a debtor 
 mr baker as i understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in this case your client filed for relief under chapter N and that relief was denied you are now seeking under official your petition seeks a conversion to chapter N and i guess i wonder what relief is still open to you 
 in the present case or the new case 
 what relief is open to you in this case in other words you are trying to get a conversion to chapter N subsequently you have tried to apply for relief under chapter N and thats been denied why isnt the case moot in the sense that that relief is not available to you now 
 the circumstances of the new case are entirely different in fact in that in the present the new case the court decided that he was not eligible because his debt limit exceeded the statutory limitations that exist section N there is a threeyear time span between the two and we believe that the existing case is not moot because he still has remedies that he can obtain in chapter N 
 but if he isnt eligible the new case determined that he was not eligible because his debts were too high he didnt incur additional debts between the time of the proceeding one and proceeding two 
 yes your honor he did 
 or he didnt reduce the official debt if we have a finding from the bankruptcy court that he is ineligible that is number one condition to convert into chapter N if you dont meet that condition thats the end of the matter 
 i wouldnt say it would be the end of the matter in the present case because the eligibility was never questioned below was never a factor below 
 but now there has been a finding and its an essential finding that there be eligibility and wouldnt the bankruptcy courts findings in the later case have preclusive effect 
 in the prior case i would say no your honor first because as i mentioned the issue of eligibility within the monetary limits was never raised below and in fact if you look at his schedules in the supplemental joint appendix he is clearly within the statutory limits based just looking at his schedules 
 but thats a question you can argue on appeal in from the recent decisions but for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that determination which i think would be preclusive on another bankruptcy court 
 the well the the official bankruptcy court made a decision in the current case the new case but they havent dismissed it dismissal is in fact on appeal to the district court for the district of massachusetts the reason is in our view is that the bankruptcy court in the new case incorrectly looked back to the claims that had been filed in the prior case now it is a difficult issue in some respects because there is case law at least in massachusetts or the first circuit that says a debtor does not have standing to object to claims in a chapter N case so the fact that a number of claims were filed and argued doesnt relate to in a prior case does not have a preclusive effect in the new case now we did in fact object to quite a number of claims and the eligibility and i think that ultimately once the claim objections are resolved we will be within the statutory limits 
 if the decision is affirmed on appeal to the first circuit do you think you could still argue that theres qualification for chapter N after the court of appeals has affirmed a determination that there isnt 
 im i dont quite follow the question would you mind restating it official 
 we have now a judgment that this debtor is ineligible for chapter N if that judgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals can you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no preclusive effect 
 yes your honor because theres a threeyear difference between the two and substantially different facts the we have to go back i think to the case thats at bar because it is those claims the claims that were filed in the current case that are the issue as i say we are in the process of doing objections to those claims and i think that ultimately we will come within them 
 they are not at issue as far as this mootness question goes i mean you are seeking to have the right to file under N and if in fact theres no eligibility to file under N you are asking for the impossible the case is simply you know its just air so i guess perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is still on appeal should we not take as a given that there is a judgment that you dont qualify for N and yet you are coming before us asking us to say that you can apply under chapter N it doesnt make any sense 
 well i would respectfully say official suggest that it does your honor because once we dont really get to the eligibility question until the court below considers it in the context of the case thats at bar we have to as i say we are in the process of objecting to claims and resolving them now the 
 well didnt you make that argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you were not eligible 
 no your honor because as i mentioned before the case law in the first circuit up to this point has held that a chapter N debtor does not have standing to object to claims now in the new case in fact the bankruptcy court 
 thats what im asking a chapter N debtor doesnt but a chapter N debtor presumably does so didnt you make the same argument to the bankruptcy court 
 in the old case yes once we converted the chapter 
 and they rejected it 
 no i beg your pardon your honor no we did not address eligibility in the present case 
 i dont care about the present case i care about the chapter N case in which official you have been found not to qualify for chapter N treatment didnt you make before that court the same argument you are making now that some of the debts shouldnt be counted 
 i did 
 they rejected it right 
 pardon 
 and they rejected it 
 the bankruptcy court did reject it yes but they rejected it because as i say up to that point the case law had held that we did not have standing to object to the claims so we were bound by what was there 
 but you said it was only a chapter N debtor who couldnt object 
 right 
 but you are applying under chapter N 
 right what im trying to say is in the previous chapter N case we lacked standing to object to those claims and that in the new chapter N case the court took the chapter N case claims and said you are bound by these in the new chapter N case 
 didnt you object to that and say you should look at these claims afresh official 
 yes 
 and what did the court say did it say it had to or that it did so and still found them over the limit 
 it the bankruptcy court in the new case said pardon the bankruptcy court in the new case said that there are circumstances under which a debtor would have standing this was in effect a new rule of law for that for this district so subsequent to that decision we did in fact object to quite a number of claims and substantially reduced the total of those claims and i think that once 
 what did the bankruptcy court say 
 the bankruptcy court sustained our objections to those claims and in fact reduced the total substantially 
 i dont understand that but did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for chapter N treatment 
 we are not finished with the claims objection process i believe that once we are 
 of course you are they have rendered a decision how could you not be finished with the claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has official rendered a final decision 
 because the bankruptcy court rendered a final decision which is on appeal in the new case we are objecting to the chapter N claims in the old case i apologize if this is confusing 
 it is terribly confusing it seems to me that the chapter N bankruptcy court had the responsibility for determining whether you qualified under the you know under the amount of debt 
 and it did so by reference to the claims that had been filed in the previous chapter N case we cant object to claims in a chapter N case that havent been filed so procedurally we had to go back to the chapter N case and do the claims objections within the context of the old chapter N case now in the chapter N case we used the the bankruptcy court used the total of those claims that had been filed in the chapter N case to determine eligibility in the N in doing so the bankruptcy court basically announced a new rule of law that the claims that had been filed would be essentially i suppose res judicata in the subsequent case but that in some cases a chapter N debtor 
 and you objected to that i official gather 
 sorry 
 you objected to that to that ruling 
 not necessarily because it does give you a vehicle to go back to the old chapter N case and do the procedural claims objections in that case which is what we did and we substantially reduced the total of the claims 
 what is the status of the chapter N case i was under the impression it had been dismissed and a determination of no discharge had been made 
 a determination of no discharge had been entered however it was an asset case so it remains open it remains open at this point until the chapter N trustee makes a distribution to creditors or files his final report with the court it has not been dismissed 
 but theres a determination that you are not entitled to a discharge that has been made 
 thats correct 
 if we just could go to the merits for a second here you are saying this word official where it says the word is you may convert and that means you can convert no matter what 
 the plain language of the statute says that yes your honor 
 no matter what okay suppose they repeal chapter N before you convert then can you convert 
 im sorry would you repeat that 
 im just producing examples where its clear you cant convert now suppose congress there is no chapter N could you convert then 
 not if theres no chapter N 
 no okay suppose he dies could you convert then 
 if the debtor dies 
 yes no inheritance no nothing 
 well there is a rule i believe its 
 even though theres no such person existing any more hes gone and his whole family is gone and theres no inheritors nothing then can he convert no official 
 right i think the rule N says the federal rules of bankruptcy 
 im trying to produce ridiculous examples maybe all right so you say even if hes dead and theres no family he still could convert thats an extreme test of my hypothetical but okay what about if in fact he goes insane no 
 well again your honor the rule says 
 what about if in fact the conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as a signal that they should mail their life savings into a particular account in switzerland can he convert then 
 the statute is plain your honor 
 you say yes on that 
 i would say yes 
 even though its going to bilk people out of millions of dollars 
 i think that the statute is plain and says that the debtor may convert 
 no matter what even if hes dead even if hes insane 
 even if hes insane official 
 well alright then i cant get anywhere with my hypotheticals 
 i would have thought the answer was no but there we are 
 mr baker couldnt the lets say the conversion goes through the first thing that the bankruptcy court does in the chapter N converted to chapter N is say im going to dismiss this suit the the bad faith taint stays with the case it doesnt get you cant erase it and so back you go to the chapter N why couldnt the bankruptcy court now sitting as a chapter N court say we are not going to let a debtor who has conducted himself in bad faith proceed in this court 
 the bankruptcy court could certainly do that the procedural safeguards of due process require obviously notice and hearing of the courts reasons for wanting to say that 
 yes but your claim doesnt rest on a due process denial of hearing does it thats not thats not the question you brought to us so it seems to me that justice ginsburgs question is not answered by saying well hed get a hearing in that case the fact remains that in that case the as i official understand it the judge in chapter N could immediately deconvert to chapter N couldnt he 
 well i wouldnt say he could immediately reconvert again there is the due process requirement that the debtor have an opportunity to be heard on the issue 
 but due process is not the issue here the fact is the bankruptcy court could deconvert or reconvert to chapter N in effect following the election that the debtor makes thats so isnt it 
 yes 
 well then why would we have a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court from looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of election go through the paperwork and the folderol of converting to N and immediately turn around admittedly having the power to deconvert that would be a rather foolish system 
 well perhaps but it is the system that congress has given us congress has said the debtor may convert at any time so long as it has not been converted previously 
 when cases are reconverted to chapter N is that typically done before official or after the filing of the chapter N plan 
 most of the time a plan is i dont do it this way but most practitioners will file a plan at the same time as they file the notice the motion to convert 
 but they dont have to 
 they dont have to 
 and the deconversion could be done prior to the filing of the plan 
 i suppose arguably it could in my view the statutory provisions of section N have to be applied to the question of conversion so i think 
 creditors under chapter N one of the prerequisites to approval of the plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they would have gotten under chapter N right 
 thats correct 
 so presumably the creditors might want to see what the chapter N plan looks like themselves 
 exactly exactly exactly and i think its the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel noted that sometimes a problem debtor files a plan and gets it confirmed pays creditors and everybody winds up better off official 
 could the district court pardon me could the bankruptcy court make that same determination in deciding whether or not to allow the chapter N proceeding to be converted he could make this inquiry in a chapter N proceeding he says i dont think you should be able to convert because theres a fraud but i will look at how the creditors come out could he do that and then you dont have the specter that justice souter referred to of this transfer back and then the transfer back which is a waste of time 
 well again the statute says that the debtor may convert except in certain circumstances i think that the requirement of a motion to convert a case gives the court the procedural mechanism for looking at the case seeing making sure that the debtor 
 but there is a difference and this is assume with me which apparently you dont agree that everywhere in law there are implied exceptions for unusual circumstances i have never found an instance where you couldnt think of some exception that they didnt see you could not bring a thing if you were insane or dead or if a death would ensue or a murder assume that all right official then the question would be well what about this instance and i think the strongest instance the strongest argument for saying theres is no exception here is the argument that the trustee discovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly that hes hidden assets maybe he has a safe deposit box and he has a key and the key the key will allow him to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide them under N the trustee has the key as soon as you convert it to N the key is given back to the debtor who has been shown dishonest now assuming you are going to have some exceptions why isnt that a very very powerful one 
 because ultimately the chapter N trustee has the same powers of the chapter N trustee with the exception as your honor is pointing out of possession of the property in the bankruptcy estate but thats how congress wrote the statute we should not ignore congresss command about the process of converting and look for exceptions before we proceed to go back to the appellate court 
 if i could come back to a prior question unless there is some different procedure required when between the two situations of denial of conversion from N to N and allowing official conversion but with immediate reconversion back to N unless theres some difference between thats required by the code in those two situations maybe it is because you have to in the reconversion situation you have to wait until the plan is filed maybe its because the bad faith doesnt carry over but unless theres some difference i dont see what this case is about 
 well ultimately the case is about the language of the statute and whether the court should apply it as written and i think 
 you cant provide any reason why theres a difference between those two 
 im sorry 
 you deny do you dispute the fact that the bankruptcy court could simultaneously convert on the motion of the debtor from N to N and during the N day period thats required by the rule the rules reconvert do you dispute that for bad faith 
 i dispute that the court could do it sua sponte and without notice and an opportunity for a hearing 
 if it gives notice and an opportunity for a hearing during the N day period official you have to give N days notice before the conversion takes place is that correct from N to N 
 i believe thats correct when you file a motion a N day notice is required yes 
 if it has the hearing during that period you dont dispute that the court could do that or do you 
 well again we come to the question of when the plan gets filed the plan isnt filed until after its converted according to the rules 
 but here there was a hearing on the motion to convert right there was a hearing 
 yes your honor 
 and as i understand it there was no objection to the character of that hearing there was no request for an evidentiary hearing so there was a hearing now does that get wiped out too just the way the determination that you couldnt convert 
 the procedure i would i would expect to see is that if the court saw an issue of fact with respect to whether the case had been converted or whether the debtor was eligible for it to be a debtor in official the chapter to which he seeks conversion then an evidentiary hearing would be required if the fact that there was no evidentiary hearing in the particular case here i think i think we have to go back to recognize the fact that most issues in bankruptcy court are decided summarily on motion practice and it is my feeling that the jurisprudence of rule N has to apply if a court sees that there are disputed issues of fact the court must schedule an evidentiary hearing it cannot it cannot simply grant summary judgment without furtherance issue of fact so this is why i say that that on these two the two particular points and obviously the question of whether it has been previously converted is very easy to determine but as previously discussed the issue of eligibility whether the claims and the debt is within the statutory limitation is an issue of fact that ultimately might require an evidentiary hearing 
 but your case as i understand it your case does not turn on the question whether there was or was not should or should not have been a hearing in this case an evidentiary hearing in this case is that correct official 
 thats correct thats correct because in our view the schedules excuse me in our view the schedules in this case clearly indicate that it that he was within the statutory limitations at least as far as the schedules go 
 mr mr baker i have i have a question on a matter that really upsets me and causes me to wonder how you know how much we can rely upon your description here you claimed in the petition that the reason your client filed under chapter N rather than N was that he was unemployed at the time and that he decided to go to N after he became employed yet on as shown in the supplemental appendix when he filed under chapter N under penalty of perjury he said that he was employed and at the meeting of the creditors he confirmed under oath that he was employed what was it was he employed or not employed 
 on the petition date itself he was not and if you look at schedule i which is at page N of the supplemental joint appendix at the bottom line bottom of the and it indicates that he was in the process of having a second tenant in his official rental property and that he was beginning a job at about the time the petition 
 it says employment occupation name of employer capital carpet and flooring how long employed five months address of employment woburn massachusetts it also says the same thing on page N of the supplemental appendix and also with the meeting of creditors if you look at the joint appendix at N a he says the same thing that he was employed was he employed or not employed 
 right 
 does he go around swearing he was when he wasnt 
 no he was he was not employed at the time if you look at his page N as you point out it says at the bottom the income given is estimated based on a new job which is about to start he had he had been the principal of a company called rlm flooring which had been closed by citizens bank so he was in fact unemployed because citizens bank had taken all of the assets of the corporation and shut it down and this put him of course behind on his mortgage so he was very concerned about finding employment so he could in fact keep get his mortgage current and then retain his home official 
 look on page N a of the appendix the meeting of creditors trustee says okay and you now work for another entity capital carpet and flooring sir and mark marrama says yes 
 right and between the between the time of petition at the meeting of creditors which was approximately six six weeks later he became employed as i say he had a mortgage he had children to whom he has to pay child support at the time he had a wife he owed a lot of money to he was concerned about having employment so he could in fact meet those obligations 
 may i ask i may have missed some of the colloquy here is it correct that he would not be eligible to file a to have a institute a chapter N proceeding if he had unsecured debts of over a certain amount 
 yes your honor 
 and what if at the time he makes the motion to convert which you say he has an absolute right to make what if the record then disclosed that he had debts exceeding that amount what should the bankruptcy judge do in that case 
 the bankruptcy judge should official examine the claims that have been filed if any do the arithmetic offer the debtor an opportunity 
 he concludes they are over the amount so it is clear under the record what should he do then 
 he should deny conversion 
 he should what 
 he should deny conversion if in fact 
 so he does not have an absolute right in all cases to convert then 
 its absolute except in the two circumstances stated in the statute one of which is as your honor is pointing out the eligibility the other is that if it has been previously converted he does not have that right if the court has no further questions i will reserve my remaining time 
 thank you mr baker 
 thank you 
 mr brunstad 
 mr chief justice and may it official please the court the bankruptcy court need not sit idly by and grant a motion which is part of an abusive scheme the power of the court is there to deny such a motion it is there by statute under section N it is there because the courts have always had power 
 under you think N is an affirmative grant of power 
 i think the second sentence of N supports the traditional powers that courts have had to grant relief to prevent or to deny relief to prevent abuse or to remedy bad faith conduct the fact that the debtor has the authorization under section N to convert a case cannot be construed to prevent the court from sua sponte taking action to prevent abuse 
 N is much more limited than that it is only if you take the second clause of that out of context and quote it as has been done that it looks like an affirmative grant it says no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action thats a much more limited narrow provision telling you not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement that a particular party raise an issue i as a official source of sweeping powers to to basically act as a roving commission in equity i think thats a miscitation 
 well chief justice roberts i think that in order to understand N the second sentence completely i think it is important to understand it was added to N in N in response to a number of decisions that were holding that the courts did not have the the bankruptcy courts did not have the authority to sua sponte take action to prevent abuse to monitor their own calendars to make sure that inappropriate things werent happening and that senator hatch when he introduced this legislation which was ultimately enacted the goal was to overturn cases like the second circuits decision in grissom to provide expressly and perhaps not as clearly as perhaps they intended to give the courts this power but i 
 was that second circuits decision a decision that said the court didnt have the power because it had not been moved to take that action by the party who had the responsibility for raising the issue was that the basis for the second circuits decision 
 in part yes the court also official 
 then then you havent contradicted what the chief justice suggested 
 well i think i think N the second sentence is worded the way that it is it doesnt say exactly that the courts may take any action of sua sponte it says shall not be construed the fact that a party has the right to make an action shall not be construed to deny the court the right sua sponte to take an action but i think that the implication of the statute is clear there is this background principle which applies not only in bankruptcy cases but in trial court cases in the district courts everywhere that this court recognized in chambers that it has specific application in this courts jurisprudence in bankruptcy in pepper versus litton and other cases that the bankruptcy courts may take action to prevent abuse and in fact they must do so because by granting a motion by sitting back and allowing the court to grant relief that furthers an abusive scheme in essence makes the court complicit in the fraud or misdealing we cant have that 
 what do you do about the different structures wording between N and N i mean this provision says debtor may the other provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to order and it suggests a difference in who has the official primary responsibility whether it is a motion of the court or whether it is an independent action 
 mr chief justice i think that the drafting conventions between the two subsections is key N says the debtor may convert whereas other sections of the code like N other provisions provide that upon request of the debtor the court shall take some particular action here the use of the may i think the word may properly signals discretion in the court 
 so you think under those other provisions the court doesnt have this inherent power or the implicit power from N that you are arguing for here 
 well if you look at section N upon request of the debtor the court shall dismiss the case that is an absolute right and for a clear reason nobody can force a debtor to continue in chapter N against the debtors will because chapter N requires the debtor to work to pay off creditors that would violate the N th amendment so there would be no circumstance where someone could block a debtor from getting out from chapter N for constitutional reasons thats a special case that is why congress drafted N the way that it did official contrast that with section N where the court said the debtor may convert now there are there are requirements that the debtor has to comply in order to convert statutory but there is also a debtor cannot have an absolute right to convert if it would be part of an abusive scheme i think the direct analogy is this courts decision in pepper versus litton there a fraudulent party wanted the court to allow a claim as part of a fraudulent scheme and this court unanimously said no we are not going to allow that even though there was a subsequent remedy further on in the process 
 if you if given that the court has express statutory authority to reconvert from N back to N why should we take the leap of conferring inherent equitable authority to do something when the statute addresses it in a much more specific way 
 two primary reasons your honor the first reason is that it would be just pointless wheel spinning 
 well maybe maybe not i mean they convert he comes up with a plan under N that looks better to creditors i mean just because theres fraud that offends the court and prompts it to take action prior to conversion doesnt mean that official thats going to be the same situation after conversion 
 but the debtor could argue in the context of the motion to convert well i would like to propose a chapter N plan perhaps the misconduct wasnt that severe and the court can take that into consideration allowing the debtor to proceed but where as here you have a clear case of abuse the court should be entitled to nip it in the bud at that particular point in time allowing the court to senselessly say oh go ahead and convert 
 even if it might injure the creditors 
 well the court can take that into account the court is not is not shackled under section N to deny conversion it can consider various factors if all the creditors were to come up and say we know the debtor has been abusing the bankruptcy system but we think you should allow the conversion to a chapter N case because perhaps that will work for the particular circumstances but whereas here there was no such thing the creditors were saying dont allow conversion this is part of an abusive scheme the trustee was saying dont allow conversion this is part of an abusive scheme the bankruptcy court if the court had signed the order then that affects the official integrity of the court is the court itself now not participating by allowing it to happen this sort of fraudulent scheme the court should be able to nip it in the bud debtors who are 
 what limitations would you recognize on this inherent authority to take action where do they come from 
 well i think that mr chief justice i think that they are the same sorts of limitations that require the district court when it is considering invocation of its inherent powers whether to exercise them or not we have always sort of recognized a special situation for bad faith conduct and clearly abusive schemes where those occur as in this case the bankruptcy court looks at the circumstances holds a hearing as was held this case considers the views of the parties who are involved and then decides now it is a relatively high bar you know bad faith it is a continuum where you have the honest but unfortunate debtor abides by all the rules clearly no bad faith implication would apply at the other end of the spectrum where you have a debtor who conceals assets doesnt disclose its found out in bankruptcy and then as soon as the trustee finds out and official is hot on the debtors trail then seeks to convert to get out from bankruptcy well there you have a clearcut case of abuse that cant be tolerated now i think that 
 mr brunstad are you going to address the mootness point do you think the case is moot 
 yes justice scalia i think candidly the case is not moot there is a good reason why we do not allow in our system two separate bankruptcy cases to be pending at the same time once a first bankruptcy case has started the court jurisdiction attaches its exclusive jurisdiction and i think the second bankruptcy case that was filed while the first bankruptcy case was still pending was filed without jurisdiction and there was actually no jurisdiction because of the prior existing case additionally i think we have to recognize that there were different debt levels at different times i dont know exactly what they were but for the first case there was debt level a about three years later there was debt level b which may well have been higher on remand if the debtor were to succeed which i hope the court does not allow the debtor to proceed or succeed here but on remand if it were determined official that with the first case the debt levels were properly below the limits under N then the debtor would be eligible to convert as far as that criteria is concerned we do not know absolutely that that would not be able to be satisfied in the existing case 
 did you make the jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy court 
 we did not participate in the second case and make that objection your honor 
 how so 
 i think that it was primarily it was the debtor was litigating and we did not make the jurisdictional argument 
 i find that extraordinary 
 so it wouldnt be before the first circuit 
 that particular issue i think the appeal of the second case is pending before the district court i think that the bankruptcy judge disposed of the case pretty summarily and decided that while this particular debtor just looking at the schedules does not have the eligibility requirements for the second case and therefore dismissed it that does not necessarily preclude a finding official upon the facts in the first case which is still pending that it could be converted i think candidly i need to say that 
 its hardly a summary disposition the opinion goes on for pages and pages 
 well this particular bankruptcy judge obviously had a lot of experience with this particular debtor having presided over the first case as well justice ginsburg so i think the bankruptcy court was very fully apprised of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case with the record and having written several opinions already in the first bankruptcy case which was still pending 
 this case your case 
 the current case today yes justice scalia 
 may i ask this question if the remedy of not allowing them to convert to chapter N is denied are there other remedies that the bankruptcy court can impose against the debtor who engages in misconduct of this kind 
 yes justice stevens but they are not tailored to this particular problem or abuse they are remedies for example the denial of the discharge for concealing assets under section N official but that wont 
 are there any criminal sanctions 
 there might be criminal sanctions for willful basically in essence its sort of an idea of theft you know by not disclosing assets but its a relatively high bar for criminality but that wont protect the creditors in the chapter N case 
 then how are the creditors hurt by this series of events 
 well the creditors are hurt because in the chapter N case once the bankruptcy case is filed the trustee takes possession of all the debtors property which becomes property of the estate the trustees role is to liquidate the property and distribute the proceeds to creditors when the case is converted to chapter N under N the property revests in the debtor including any concealed property at that point under section N upon conversion the chapter N trustee is disenfranchised his services terminate what debtors in bankruptcy who are perpetuating this kind of concealment scheme want you to do is say oh no you can go ahead and convert and then maybe we will deal with it later because maybe later on official in the proceedings something will happen the chapter N trustee might not be apprised of it the case might go to a different bankruptcy judge in some jurisdictions the chapter N docket is heard by an entirely separate bankruptcy judge they would like to get the benefit of delay in conversion because perhaps they can get away with it in the subsequent chapter N case or alternatively in the chapter N case if the debtor doesnt file a plan then the chapter N trustee who may have hundreds and hundreds of chapter N cases he or she is responsible for on a check list might simply check off no plan filed case dismissed in which case the creditors dont get the benefit of the liquidation they dont get the benefit of the assets being recovered they dont get equality of distribution under the chapter N scheme and the debtors fraud is in essence gotten away with so that is why when a motion to convert comes up and the bankruptcy court sees 
 wouldnt a chapter N case be refiled immediately 
 not necessarily your honor not necessarily the debtor could move to another jurisdiction 
 but the creditors arent official going to let him just run away with the assets are they 
 well justice stevens in many many chapter N cases in many many bankruptcy cases you have creditors most of the creditors may hold claims of $N $N $N this case is unique because there happened to be a creditor citizens bank who was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars who had an interest in pursuing the case in many other cases thats why one of the reasons why we have a chapter N trustee to represent the interest of myriad small claimants who collectively have no individual incentive to really incur all the costs to monitor the system by converting the case from N to N disenfranchising that representative of all the creditors the debtor who wants to play the game of concealing the assets and catch me if you can can in essence get away with it this bankruptcy judge understood this this bankruptcy judge denied the conversion so we would keep the case in chapter N the chapter N trustee could do his job collect the assets 
 could the chapter N trustee be appointed the trustee in the chapter N the same trustee who has now been hes terminated because official the chapter N has been converted could the court in the chapter N format appoint the same trustee 
 no justice ginsburg there is a standing chapter N trustee in chapter N cases that handles all the chapter N cases unless for some reason that chapter N trustee must recuse him or herself under section N once the case is converted from N to N the chapter N trustee services are terminated 
 what does the trustee do hes not really a trustee under N is he 
 the chapter N trustee 
 i mean the property doesnt vest in him you have told it it remains in the ownership of the debtor 
 yes justice scalia the chapter N trustee is probably characterized mostly an administrative person who supervises to see that the chapter N procedures are complied with has the debtor filed the chapter N plan if not 
 hes called a trustee though 
 correct justice scalia 
 well thats really not his capacity official 
 in practical reality thats correct justice scalia what the chapter N trustee does is if a plan is not filed moves to dismiss the case if a plan is filed may look at the plan if the plan is confirmed acts as the disbursing agent the debtor typically makes payments under the plan to the chapter N trustee the chapter N trustee then makes distributions to creditors and on chapter N day in many jurisdictions one day a week or every other week the chapter N trustee will come to court with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of files 
 its called chapter N day 
 in many places it is your honor and they have a chapter N bankruptcy judge often its assigned to the most junior bankruptcy judge sitting in the particular jurisdiction with hundreds and hundreds of cases the chapter N trustee has neither the incentive nor the resources to do the things that a chapter N trustee does every single day and not only that the chapter N trustee does not have the power to go after collecting all of the property and liquidating it its denied that power under the statutory scheme so it makes no sense its pointless to say we must the bankruptcy judge must idly sit by grant official a motion thats part of this abusive scheme allow the case to be converted to chapter N hold another hearing have a second set of papers perhaps only to send the case back to chapter N 
 the sense it makes is that thats what the statute provides and rather than relying on this alleged inherent power that apparently is not boundless and that the bounds of which will have to be articulated in case after case after case the statute provides a very clear mechanism to address the issue of fraud which allows him to reconvert it back to chapter N promptly 
 well i think mr chief justice in the link case the court rejected that argument in construing section N where the court said quote neither the permissive language of the rule which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the purpose of the rule to be abrogate the power of courts acting on their own initiative to clear their calendars of cases that have remained dormant because of the inaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief likewise in chambers i think the same principle applied the court said we dont need to wait and deal with these subsequently occurring procedures to remedy official the problem we should do it now and that is the that is the clear import of this courts unanimous decision in pepper versus litton there was a remedy of equitable subordination for the fraudulent claim that could have been invoked far later in the proceeding and this court unanimously said no you dont have to wait for that proceeding later where its clear that there has been fraud the creditors scheme has been fraudulent a fraudulent claim the court can act at the time of allowance of the claim and simply deny the claim the reason for it i think is the reason articulated in chambers the integrity of the court itself is implicated if it has to sit back idly by and watch the abusive process unfold 
 well i still havent gotten an answer i think on what the prejudice is who is prejudiced by the procedure set forth in the statute the conversion takes place the judge then says because of this fraud im going to reconvert it to chapter N who suffers under that you say sit idly by but i dont see the long passage of time 
 well the creditors suffer mr chief justice and they suffer because there are additional administrative costs that are incurred that compete with their distributions we are already talking official about dividing up an inadequate pie to satisfy all claims in full having a second set of procedures prejudices the creditors it prejudices the court bankruptcy judges can have thousands and thousands of cases on their dockets to have to have a second set of procedures a second hearing it burdens the court unnecessarily and again it also implicates again and i think this is fundamental the integrity of the process 
 is it true or not what i said because i dont know the area that if in fact you had a dishonest debtor the present the proceeding is dismissed on N he gets the papers back the papers permit him access to a hidden source of resources and he steals them basically is that possible or is that fanciful 
 justice breyer that is certainly possible and i think that is why congress has said you dont have an absolute right as a debtor under section N to dismiss your chapter N case 
 thank you counsel 
 thank you 
 we will hear from ms blatt first 
 i beg your pardon official 
 ms blatt 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court a bankruptcy court has the inherent authority to sanction a debtor who has acted in bad faith by denying his request to convert a chapter N case to chapter N courts have the inherent authority to take appropriate action to prevent an abuse of process nothing in the bankruptcy code or section N purports to impair or limit the bankruptcy courts power to police the integrity of its own proceedings 
 why isnt the power to reconvert sufficient 
 the power to reconvert under section N is in this case where the court is already confronted with an adjudicated bad faith litigator its indirect its inefficient and its inadequate to protect the bankruptcy process the potential for abuse is very significant if the case languishes in chapter N for any period of time because the bad faith debtor gets control over the very asset he fraudulently sought to conceal official 
 well what are the odds that thats going to happen if you have a judge whos exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent authority to deny relief hes not going to let it languish under chapter N 
 well he may or may not bankruptcy courts have thousands of cases and if there is an absolute automatic right to convert a court with thousands of cases may put off that chapter N reconversion to another day moreover there may be individual creditors without a sufficient stake to raise the issue and the chapter N trustee who typically will uncover the fraud cannot oppose conversion if theres a right to convert in bad faith and the chapter N trustee or the united states 
 well why wouldnt that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he reconvert it to chapter N 
 well the chapter N trustee is hes terminated on conversion it doesnt raise chapter N issues the much more likely scenario is the chapter N trustee will tell the united states trustee or the chapter N trustee but they may or may not learn about it until after the case converts in jurisdictions where there is official 
 why cant they just have an order to the bankrupt to disclose the asset in the chapter N proceeding 
 an order to disclose the asset 
 in the chapter N proceeding 
 well we are talking about a case the court may or may not know about the fraud and the trustee may or may not tell someone in time if theres 
 well in this case they knew about it didnt they 
 yes and there was a basis to oppose conversion in jurisdictions where theres an absolute right and bad faith is not a grounds for the conversion 
 whenever he denies the motion he must know about it he must have a reason to deny 
 we are by hypothesis talking about an absolute right to convert and what im trying to say in jurisdictions where there is an absolute right the practice of bankruptcy courts is not to simultaneously convert it does happen on occasion but the more likely scenario is that a significant period of official time passes but the other point is that if theres a simultaneous conversion its a completely pointless and burdensome process and heres why a conversion and simultaneous conversion causes the termination and reappointment of the chapter N trustee the appointment and the immediate termination of the chapter N trustee and to the extent theres already pending chapter N proceedings for dismissal or denial of discharge the conversion would appear to us to moot those proceedings and require their reinstatement and this is a completely unnecessary waste of everyones time and energy 
 may i just clear up one detail thats confusing to me the are there two judges does the same judge rule on both the motion to convert and the motion to reconvert 
 yes in the majority of jurisdictions there are one or two jurisdictions where there are different judges but the vast majority its before the same judge but a if a if theres a if theres a right to convert in bad faith all you have is a notice of conversion and assuming the eligibility is met and it hasnt previously converted a court may say well 
 i wouldnt call it a right to convert in bad faith if its a right its a official right to convert despite the allegation of bad faith its not a right to convert in bad faith no one is arguing for that 
 well i think that our point is that the absence of bad faith is implicit in the statute because there is this background rule when a litigant comes to a court thats already abused the courts process or seeks relief of bad faith it is a core element of a courts inherent authority to simply deny relief you can toss out an entire complaint when a litigant seeks it in bad faith if there was an apparent benefit to this go to N first or deny it the united states trustee wouldnt be here we see no benefit to the debtor to require the court to convert and then reconvert all it is is an unnecessary waste of everyones time and this is a core element of an inherit authority 
 what about the idea that the debtor can come in and say under N look whether the facts bear this out in this case or not i have got a job now i can pay off my debtors my creditors according to this plan and as the statute requires the creditors get more under N than under under N thats a benefit to everybody 
 heres why i dont think official theres any dispute under 
 and he says im sorry about that bad faith business 
 sure right and theres nothing to stop a debtor who truly converts and has found religion and wants to come clean for arguing let me convert its in the interest of everybody if i do convert this is a discretionary right to deny relief the court is free to allow conversion but under the plain terms of section N the court has the power to dismiss or reconvert a case to chapter N without waiting for a plan to be filed theres no requirement that the court has to sit there for N days and see if theres a plan a chapter N excuse me 
 if the statute didnt provide that a chapter N plan could be reconverted to a chapter N would the court have the inherent equitable authority to do that 
 to reconvert to chapter N 
 sure 
 i dont know if that would be an appropriate remedy it might be because you can have an involuntary chapter N case but on this point about a court sitting in chapter N if on day one a chapter N official debtor files a plan in bad faith the debtor can say please wait i have got a plan im working on it give me a couple extra weeks and the court can say no i have the authority to throw it out and whats particularly odd about this proposal is that in N a court is categorically prohibited from allowing a chapter N debtor to proceed under chapter N if the petition is filed in bad faith the court cant confirm a plan so congress had no interest in protecting bad faith debtors after N and they didnt before N theres no policy preference in the code for bad faith debtors or allowing a debtor either proceeding in chapter N or moving from chapter N to chapter N and we think this is a modest exercise of a courts inherent authority simply to deny relief when the court is already confronted with a clear case of abuse while the case is in chapter N or the debtor has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process the last thing id like to say is 
 well what about the difference in language under N and the other provisions N says the debtor may the other provisions call for action by the court which suggests at least that the authority to convert is greater under N official 
 i think section N is fairly read as granting a statutory right to convert absent the two statutory exceptions or the courts proper exercise of inherent authority but the N and just explain that the court may do something or the court may not or the court shall do something so we think our position section N isnt even addressed to the court at all it just gives the debtor the right to convert and it doesnt purport to limit or speak to the situation when the debtor seeks that relief in bad faith or has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process and id just like to end by saying that a debtors bad faith concealment of assets or misrepresentation of financial affairs is really the most serious abuse you can have in a chapter N case it threatens the very structural foundation of the code and its integrity 
 does the government have any position on the mootness question here 
 well our position is that its not moot because its on appeal if that decision is affirmed it would in a sense practically be moot because there would be an alternative grounds and the debtor wouldnt be eligible under chapter N in any event but we didnt see that as necessarily an article iii mootness problem official 
 i guess i have been assuming but the eligibility under chapter N even under the present case is a present day question right in other words we dont go back and see if he was eligible for chapter N when the conversion was denied the question would be whether hes eligible now 
 we have not compared the two the two chapters well there was never a chapter N petition we have not compared the chapter N petition with the after this case this court granted certiorari then the chapter N but it is on appeal to the district court so its not presently moot we would ask for those reasons that the first circuits decision be affirmed 
 thank you ms blatt now mr baker 
 thank you your honor and mr chief justice 
 im sorry you have two minutes remaining 
 thank you your honor the first thing i would like to say is that official having been counsel to a chapter N trustee many years ago i can assure the court the chapter N trustees exercise all of the powers and authority that a chapter N trustee does with the exception as was said of possession of property of the estate the property of the estate remains vested however in the chapter N trustee throughout the length of the case it does not revest in the debtor until the case is either dismissed a discharge is issued and the case is closed so the concerns about leaving a debtor to do anything it wants to with property of the bankruptcy estate simply is not a reality and i think it does a disservice to the many fine chapter N trustees that there are around the country 
 im not sure i understood what you just said you said until the plan is filed and approved the property remains in the possession of the chapter N trustee 
 no it does not remain in her possession the chapter N trustee technically never has possession the title remains vested in the chapter N trustee 
 so is it possible if its in N that then the debtor lets say a dishonest debtor could get back pieces of paper which would admit official that debtor to the possession of certain property which he could then take and hide in a way that that couldnt happen in N is that possible or not possible 
 its certainly possible but then again there are statutory and rulebased remedies for that sort of activity and our position is that those rules and those statutes are what should control in the case thank you very much your honor 
 thank you mr baker the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in united states versus resendizponce mr dreeben 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in neder versus united states this court held that the omission of an offense element from petit jury instructions can be harmless error even though that omission violates the sixth amendment right to a jury trial our submission is that the same analysis applies to the omission of an offense element from a grand jurys indictment such an error violates the fifth amendment but it is harmless when the petit jury having been properly instructed on all of the elements of the offense returns a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
 im not quite sure if this works but at the trial before a petit jury theres an opportunity for counsel to object there isnt an opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment official comes down now i guess you could move to quash 
 thats correct justice kennedy in fact parties do move to dismiss indictments for failure to allege all of the elements of the offense that happened here the motion was erroneously denied by the trial judge the trial judge under ninth circuit law under the assumption that the ninth circuit has properly interpreted the law should have concluded that this indictment failed to allege the substantial step that was part of the attempt and if the judge had done that then the government would have gotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding indictment instead what the judge did was deny the motion finding that the indictment itself was sufficient and then instructed the jury on all of the elements that the ninth circuit requires as part of this offense and so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond a reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve a substantial step towards the completion of the offense 
 isnt the problem that the motion to quash is going to be made if counsel is on his toes is going to be made at the beginning of the trial and we want to induce the court to look very official carefully at it at that point because if the court is wrong somebody has to go through an entire trial as a result of it and the way to induce the court to be very careful at the beginning is to say this is not harmless error and you have got to take this very seriously and you cant take any chance on the in effect the evidence saving you in harmless error analysis later 
 well first of all justice souter motions like this are typically made long in advance of trial as this one was waiting until the day of trial is far from the optimum practice 
 well im sure thats right but that simply reinforces my point 
 well i think what it reinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at it and conscientiously attempt to get the law right without the need for the court to apply the heavy hand of automatic reversal 
 but you concede that the error would always be harmless if you have a trial before a petit jury and all of the elements are instructed to be found by the jury 
 yes justice ginsburg that is our position official 
 that doesnt necessarily make sense you can imagine a situation where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the prosecutor says you know we are going to find that evidence once we get into it we dont have it now but indict anyway without it in other words whats your response to the situation where theres no probable cause on an element at the time of the indictment but that evidence is later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict 
 my response mr chief justice is the same response that this court gave in united states versus mechanik where it was confronted with an analogous problem and that was in that case a violation of the rule that allowed two witnesses to testify at the same time before the grand jury and the court was specifically confronted with the question was this harmless error because the petit jury has now found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and it answered that question yes and en route to that answer it said we could logically be persuaded that what we are supposed to do is compare the evidence in front of the grand jury to the error and see whether the error was prejudicially consequential for the grand official jurys decision but we are not going to do that the court explicitly said in mechanik because once there is a finding of beyond a reasonable doubt the question of probable cause is shown a fortiori and 
 excuse me you mean you can never decide this question until after the trial is completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a reasonable doubt 
 no justice scalia the district court should decide this question in advance of trial when its properly raised and if the indictment is defective dismiss it and this court has recognized that trial judges dont need incentives of an automatic reversal rule to get them to comply with the law and i want to amend 
 did the us attorney in this case oppose the motion to quash the indictment 
 in this case 
 yes 
 yes and the ninth circuits ruling that this indictment was defective was really bolt outoftheblue might be too strong but it was an extension of its prior precedents in a way that wasnt directly foreseeable the united states attorneys office had every reason to believe based on language in official prior ninth circuit cases that alleging an attempt to enter was adequate to allege the offense 
 mr dreeben this touches on what troubles me about this i wonder whether we can answer the generic question that you presented whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from the indictment can constitute harmless error without considering the nature of the alleged defect here i dont know how you can answer if you look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible to harmless error analysis or whether if we were to agree with you in fact it is harmless how you can answer those questions without reaching a conclusion about whether there was any defect in the indictment in the first place 
 justice alito 
 and it doesnt seem to me that theres any defect in this indictment it charges it recites the language of the statute it uses the word attempt which has a very wellsettled meaning in the law any lawyer would understand exactly what is required for an attempt it sets out the factual basis of the charge so i dont know how you would get to the how you can answer the second question without getting into the first question official 
 we did not challenge in our certiorari petition which this court granted the ninth circuits holding that in order for an attempt to be accomplished there needs to be a substantial step and in an indictment under section N there needs to be an allegation of what that substantial step is 
 i have the same problem its such a difficult requirement to get a hold of i mean he drives the car he walks he breathes i mean all of these things enable him to get into the country i just dont understand the basis for the rule 
 well it is common law 
 he wasnt forced to go over he did it on his own it seems to me thats 
 well thats certainly the governments position justice kennedy but it is well settled in the common law that attempts require a substantial step towards the completion there are variations that different jurisdictions use thats the model penal code formulation the ninth circuit i think has gone beyond where some other courts have gone as justice alito was noting by saying that the indictment needs to spell out the factual basis for that substantial step 
 what would that be here official that he drove the car to the border that he got out of the car that he presented a document what if you could do it over again what would the indictment say 
 the indictment would have to say that he attempted to enter the united states and took a substantial step towards the completion of that crime to wit he approached the border and came to the guard and presented false identifications to the guard and lied about his intended destination 
 if you went back to the if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth century criminal pleading laws criminal pleading laws they would say that where you use a legal term that has a wellN established meaning such as attempt you dont need to spell out the definition of that of that concept its enough to use the term so what the ninth circuit has done is to resurrect you know to go back to something thats more demanding than would have been required in a nineteenth century indictment and frame that as a violation of the fifth amendment 
 well justice alito im not going to defend what the ninth circuit did here but i will be clear about the following there is a generic legal issue at stake in this case that we face in the ninth circuit and in other courts around the country official because indictments are not always written perfectly and whether its an element that the ninth circuit has improperly read into it or an element that a court has properly read into a statute we do face the situation where 
 as to the element i thought that what the ninth circuit talked about was overt act they didnt use the words overt act 
 they did justice breyer 
 yes all right i thought that comes out of conspiracy law it doesnt even out of attempt law then i thought its unlikely but here you can correct me the us code is filled with the word attempt just opening it at random there are attempts to assault and steal mail matter there are attempts to steal the mail matter there are attempts to rob a bank attempts here attempts there is it the governments practice whenever they charge a violation of any of these provisions to not just use the word attempt but to use the words substantial step 
 no 
 i would have thought the answer was no and therefore this isnt just a small error of a technical sort the ninth circuit is official completely wrong and not even close and therefore if they are not even close can the government come up here where theres an obvious error and they decide the government that it would like to have a declaration by this court on a matter that they think is quite interesting and important to them in a lot of other cases where they cant win the cases easily thats im putting it a little pejoratively because im trying to get you to see what im driving at its like a hokedup case why not im using it pejoratively only so that you can see what im worried about 
 we didnt really have a lot of choice about it i mean the ninth circuit decided to read the statute this way and it reversed the conviction theres not a circuit split under section N we have to bring thousands of indictments in the ninth circuit so we are not exactly going to set up test cases to risk our convictions based on the ninth circuits rule 
 but you are making the concession only for purposes of this case that is in another case you would be free to say the word attempt is good enough you dont have to spell out in the indictment a particular overt act official 
 justice ginsburg its not unusual for this court to decide a case where the government does not challenge the underlying constitutional ruling and make some remedial argument two very notable examples are united states versus leon where the government did not challenge the underlying fourth amendment claim that was found to be valid by the lower court but instead simply asked for a modification of the exclusionary rule and another example is rose versus clark which involves a fairly analogous issue to this one whether it can be harmless error to fail to incorporate into the jury instructions the actual element and instead rely on a mandatory rebuttable presumption in that case the state did not challenge whether the instruction violated the constitution this court didnt decide it instead what it decided was the remedial question of harmless error which is an important question and i submit doesnt change in character depending on the nature of the underlying error 
 we have done it before theres no doubt about it but the better practice usually is to have a case in which the issue really presents the hard question and you are asking us to make a ruling in this case that would govern failure to official allege an aggravating circumstance in a death case for example which has a different atmosphere to the whole case when you are facing that kind of an issue 
 it may have a different atmosphere but i dont think that it has any different legal analysis behind it 
 a judges reaction to a case is often affected by just exactly whats involved and here its just hard to see how anyone could claim any particular prejudice out of the error in this particular case or really its arguable that theres no defect in the indictment at all because it was adequate notice to the defendant of what hes charged with this is much like a case in the state systems where you have notice pleading it doesnt seem very prejudicial but you put it in a different context you might have a different reaction to the case 
 well i think our fundamental submission here is that with respect to the probable cause determination there is no prejudice because of the petit jurys verdict with respect to notice we would acknowledge that a defendant could argue that the defect in a grand jury indictment in a particular case could fail to give him adequate notice such that he official might have a casespecific claim of prejudice and be able to overturn the conviction on the facts of this case i agree with you justice stevens that would not be a very strong argument there really is no reason to think that there was any notice problem with this very discrete transaction which was alleged in the indictment as occurring on a particular date in a particular place 
 does this come up very often i think the case the issue you want to raise because i would think normally theres a motion before the trial well before the jury is empanelled the defendant says i want you to dismiss this the indictments inadequate and if thats even close i would think normally the prosecutor would go back and say fine i will get a superseding indictment and that would end the problem and it seems to me so likely to happen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling against the defendant and then it goes through a whole trial almost never happens 
 justice breyer i think that an empirical perspective might be helpful here and i think an empirical perspective if you look around the circuits and you see the number of issues cases in which this issue is raised it becomes clear that there are a large number of situations in which mistakes get official made i mean we are talking about a federal system here in which N to N cases are indicted a year mistakes will happen and they will happen both by the trial judge and by the prosecutor and there will be situations in which the circuits change the law or the interpretation of the law after the decision in question i think that this is a good example of that where the ninth circuit extended its prior precedents to find that an indictment that didnt allege the overt act was inadequate and then the government is stuck and the rule of automatic reversal which the court may appear to think in this case is particularly disproportionate since the indictment looks fine functions identically even if theres a conceded violation that every member of the court would say yes theres a missing element here the fundamental problem is that the grand jury sits to decide probable cause it does not decide whether the defendant is actually guilty 
 well it sits to decide whether people should be indicted and yes they are supposed to determine whether theres probable cause but historically a significant role for the grand official jury has been not to indict people even though the government had the evidence to indict them 
 well i actually do not agree that theres any stronger evidence mr chief justice that grand juries didnt indict when the government had adequate evidence than there is historical evidence that petit juries did not convict when theres proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both instances you can point to historical instances in which grand juries and petit juries played a role of in effect nullifying when there was adequate evidence but its clear from the neder decision that that history has not led to the conclusion that this court cannot evaluate petit jury defects for harmlessness and the same conclusion ought to be true a fortiori for the grand jury 
 the trouble with your a fortiori argument it seems to me is this if we accept your argument then whenever a judge is asked to rule on a motion to quash if the judge is in any doubt the judge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the motion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial and if in fact they get to trial and they dont prove the element then it can either be thrown out because an element has not been proven or he can go back and revive official the motion to quash if on the other hand the government gets its act together at that point and does put in evidence on the element its going to be harmless error and so the price of it seems to me of your rule is that someone will always be put to trial if there is any question about how the judge should rule on the motion to quash whereas if we go the other way the judge will grant the motion to quash and the government can go back to the grand jury and get another indictment it seems to me that something is seriously lost in that situation if we go your way 
 well justice souter experience doesnt show that in fact district courts dont grant these motions they grant them as justice breyer indicated when the indictment is not sufficient 
 im sure they do grant them but im concerned about the we will say the doubtful case or the judge who cant make up his mind under your rule the price of that uncertainty is always going to be to subject somebody to trial 
 well i do think we can assume that article iii judges are a hearty enough species so that they can make up their minds and they can rule but to the extent that there is a risk here that judges official might reserve the motion that is the same risk that the court fessed up to and acknowledged in the mechanik case where in fact the judge did reserve the motion 
 and it seems to me that the prejudice to the defendant in the two as between the two situations simply is not comparable in mechanik you had a situation in which two witnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting in were in the jury room and yes one could influence the other et cetera here we are talking about a situation in which it may very well be that the defendant should never be put to trial at all and your rule says if theres any question about it put him to trial judge 
 well given that this issue arises only when you have a petit jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt it seems overwhelmingly likely that any grand jury would have found probable cause 
 do we know do we have the grand jury transcripts so do we know that in fact evidence was put before the grand jury that false identifications were presented at the border 
 the grand jury transcript is not in this record justice ginsburg and we do not official suggest that the court adopt a rule in which it reviews the adequacy of the evidentiary showing before the grand jury there are important values in grand jury secrecy they will of course be compromised at the trial stage if witnesses testify and the testimony is turned over in that context but more important than the practical aspect is exactly the logic that the court used in mechanik the point of the grand jury indictment is to determine is there enough to take this person to trial once the person has been taken to trial and been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt we know that if the government went back to the grand jury it would be able to get an indictment 
 how far would you go with the mechanik logic suppose that someone is charged by information with a felony without the persons consent and for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss the information and then the person is convicted would you say that because the petit jury returned a verdict that the fact that the person was charged with a felony by information calls for no remedy 
 no i would not go that far justice alito i would draw the same line that this court drew in the midland asphalt case where it was official looking at a somewhat analogous problem of an interlocutory appeal and the same line that it drew in neder itself in neder the court said if the judge directs a verdict of guilty thats an impermissible act and it cannot be rendered harmless no matter how overwhelming the evidence is in the midland asphalt case this court dealt with whether the language of the fifth amendment created a right not to be tried and it does say no person shall be held to answer absent an indictment issued by a grand jury and the court said if you have a defect that causes an indictment not to be an indictment or as in your hypothetical justice alito no indictment at all or if you have a defect that causes the grand jury not to be a grand jury those are the kind of fundamental errors that would give rise to a right not to be tried such that you could take an appeal before trial an interlocutory appeal and i would submit that the same kind of principle would apply here 
 so its just a metaphysical inquiry when is an indictment not an indictment its not some other standard of whats fundamentally unfair or from the sixth amendment whether or not theres notice official 
 im borrowing the language from the midland asphalt opinion but i think that it was a poetic way of putting the point that if you dont have 
 you say poetic i said metaphysical when is an indictment not an indictment 
 when you dont have one 
 now why would there be any difference then thats a question i was about to put to you what if there is no indictment at all why couldnt you say the same thing well you know the only purpose of getting it is to see if there was probable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt 
 you could push the logic of that argument that far 
 i dont think its pushing it i think its there 
 just as in the neder case you could say that it would be harmless error if a judge directed a jury verdict when the evidence was overwhelming on all of the elements but the court did draw a distinction between those two situations and i think that its one that responds to a kind of commonsense view of how fundamental an intrusion is there official 
 doesnt an indictment have as its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime hes being accused of committing isnt that so thats why i thought it would be quite clear wouldnt it or helpful to say that to the ninth circuit and so an error is when it doesnt do that and an error is when it leaves out an element and he doesnt know what crime is being committed hes accused of so suppose you had an indictment that really did that now he doesnt know what crime hes accused of and then you go to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into at what point did he work out what crime he was being accused of rather hard to say 
 well chances are he did know what crime he was accused of 
 well yes of course the chances are but theres a possibility he didnt 
 and we submit 
 so if he didnt and therefore the indictment was faulty in that respect then what are you going to say we have to track down i mean what its reminding me of is like trying to say whether he got an adequate lawyer didnt get an adequate lawyer who knows that kind of problem 
 well it isnt quite like official that i hope justice breyer i mean notice defects are very commonly alleged by defendants and courts know how to look for prejudice they know how to say whether the defendant was denied an opportunity to prepare his defense or misled by the indictment in some fashion or another and thats a very common case by case sort of prejudice inquiry that fits with the nature of the violation 
 me until halfway through the trial that it was robbery i was being accused of because they left robbery out of the indictment 
 well what you get are cases where there needs to be an effect on interstate commerce and its not alleged and then the government comes up with proof im not saying that there is going to be a vast pool of cases in which defendants would validly be able to show prejudice from lack of notice and thats because we do have many other means in the criminal justice system to alert the defendant to what hes facing theres discovery theres the opportunities for a bill of particulars to be filed those are the kinds of conventional harmless error inquiries that are appropriate when you have a claim that the indictment fails to give adequate notice but what is not official appropriate is for the ninth circuit to impose a rule on the government and on the system of justice that says we will automatically reverse because there are important values at stake here whenever a rule of automatic reversal is contemplated and this was true in the mickens versus taylor case where the court rejected a rule of automatic reversal when a judge didnt ask a question in response to an obvious conflict 
 im still not sure of your test its whether or not its fundamentally unfair whether or not theres notice which sounds like more sixth amendment than fifth or whether its not an indictment a rose is a rose type of thing 
 there are two aspects to our rule justice kennedy the first is that to the extent that the claim of a defective indictment goes to the question of was there probable cause that error and that constitutional value is not a basis for reversal once a petit jury has found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the same point to the extent that the defect in the indictment goes to inadequate notice a defendant can make such a claim post trial that the indictment prejudiced him because it was inadequately framed but that should be done on a casespecific basis rather than official on a rule of automatic reversal 
 mr dreeben if we disagree with you here could this defendant be retried could he be reindicted 
 yes justice scalia i dont believe there would be any double jeopardy bar to reindicting him since he is the one whos challenged his conviction id like to reserve the remainder of my time 
 thank you mr dreeben 
 thank you 
 mr baggot 
 mr chief justice if it please the court the structure created by the constitution of this country provides a single means of charging a person with a federal criminal offense the intention of the framers of the constitution was that a group of ordinary citizens would take time away from their families their businesses and their other concerns for the purpose of deciding whether the requirements of the official fifth amendment have been met by a government prosecutor and in in a few words whether a trial should proceed or not 
 you could say the same thing about a petit jury and in neder we use the harmless error standard 
 absolutely but the proceedings before a grand jury are secret we never know what happened inside a grand jury its a closed door proceeding it is an independent body it is not subject to any appeals or reviews by the trial judge the only thing that we know what happened behind those closed doors was the document that emerges which is the indictment which becomes public knowledge nothing else is known about what happened in that jury room now i will take a guess as to what happened the government told the grand jury that the overt act requirement was not necessary or perhaps i will take another guess they stated to the grand jury what they stated to the district judge that the indictment does in fact state the overt act when plainly it doesnt 
 suppose suppose we found out somebody told what happened and it was a crime of bank robbery or its an assault of a mailman a postman and you know it turns out they didnt present one word official of evidence not a word that says that this individual who was assaulted had anything to do with the mail theres complete absence of any evidence whatsoever on a major element of the offense and now suppose we get finished with the trial plenty of evidence conviction can you go back and raise that 
 i believe it would be raised 
 no no i mean can you win 
 oh can you win 
 yeah 
 you can always raise it 
 i mean you see im saying is that error is that correctible error im saying there is an absolute error it is far worse than here we know for a certainty there was no evidence whatsoever presented to the grand jury on a major element of the crime 
 you are assuming somehow the transcript has been disclosed 
 yes i assume we know that take that as a given we know 
 the doors are open they are not closed 
 yeah we know official 
 we know what happened and basically theres zero evidence 
 yes zero 
 your honor the history of this courts treatment of grand jury is that they may consider any evidence they may consider 
 yes but what is the answer to my question yes or no im saying after the 
 i believe in that situation the petit jurys verdict would stand 
 thats right so the answer is no 
 the answer is no 
 and if you cant raise that which is a major area because theres a harmless error is what it really amounts to why isnt the same true here where the error is far more likely to be simply technical and make no difference given the adequacy of the evidence 
 because the constitution contemplates that the grand jury be independent that its decision 
 it does as well in my case 
 not be reviewed that theres no appeal theres no review process for what official the grand jury did behind its closed doors whether we open the doors or not 
 what if its perfectly 
 sir 
 im sorry what if its perfectly clear that the error is simply a clerical error lets take a case where somebody is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and before the grand jury we look at the transcript we see that the prosecutor introduced evidence of five judgments of convictions for felony offenses and the jury is properly charged that they have to find that this individual was a convicted felon and theres simply and then when the case is tried at when the case is tried the defense even stipulates that the person is a convicted felon but theres a clerical mistake in preparing the indictment and it doesnt recite the fact that the defendant was previously convicted of a felony its your position that there must be a reversal there 
 your honor if there is a clerical error rule N gives the trial judge the ability and the power and the authority to correct an error which is purely clerical i refer you to the case of contrerasrojas which was this exact defense official 
 but what if it comes up on appeal nothing is done until it comes up on appeal 
 well i believe 
 which is exactly in the posture of this case 
 well rule N says the court may correct clerical errors at any situation but that your question presupposes that we know what happened in the grand jury room that it should have been an indictment they intended it to be in the indictment 
 how do you distinguish the mail the letter carrier case that justice breyer posed because there you said even though there was no evidence at all of what this person was if the petit jury found it that would not be subject to review i dont think you answered justice breyer and he said if you concede that the failure to introduce any evidence that this person was a letter carrier 
 i would like to even sharpen justice breyers hypothetical lets assume that the indictment did set forth what the overt act was it did but there was no evidence of that overt act introduced before the grand jury what would the result of that be 
 the result official 
 then the trial occurs 
 and hes found guilty 
 hes convicted and i think you are going your position is that conviction would stand 
 my position is the conviction would stand yes sir 
 that doesnt seem to me to make a lot of sense 
 well the grand jury is independent there is no review from the grand jury the petit jury is an independent institutional body the function of the grand jury is not only to find probable cause rightly or wrongly but the function of the grand jury is also to select the charge and specifically since your decision in recuenco versus washington that sentencing enhancements are to be treated the same way as basic elements of the offense to be charged also the grand jurys role is going to be even better my position is simply that there is no review whatsoever from the grand jury if you are unhappy you are a defendant you are unhappy with what the grand jury did you say theres no evidence you go to trial you get acquitted thats the only review official there is of the grand jury and what they did if theres an error the case must go back to the same grand jury or conceivably another grand jury theres no jeopardy at that stage theres no constitutional complications and the government is free to go back quite frankly im very surprised the government did not just go back and amend the indictment not amend it but supersede the indictment and allege an overt act the basic problem we have here is that there are so many acts committed by everybody which could be in furtherance of a crime and the problem is going to trial that we dont know which act the government was talking about they told us in motion proceedings that the entry itself was the overt act but the court of appeals ruled that that cannot be an overt act so possibly mr resendiz was entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
 cant you ask for a bill of particulars 
 i could have done that yes 
 well then you would have had no problem 
 but bill of particulars are not favored motions and what is to that would still be the government speaking on behalf of the grand jury official 
 were you were you surprised at trial by the evidence that the defendant had submitted two false identifications was the first time you heard about that at trial 
 your honor justice ginsburg i would submit that the prejudice to the defendant at the jury trial the petit jury was a slight prejudice the real problem i feel was on appeal that if the government had alleged 
 but were you was there any element of surprise in this trial did you not know beforehand that the government was going to present evidence of two false identifications 
 no i knew that your honor 
 so there was no lack of notice there was no surprise 
 in our court we have complete discovery they copy the file for it and hand it to us so we know everything they know but what we did not know is what the government would rely on as their overt act they said it was the entry itself the court of appeals ruled as a matter of law rightly or wrongly that that cannot be an overt act because it simply 
 well surely submitting false identification could be a overt act official 
 it could be but 
 is there any doubt about that 
 it could be an overt act it could be lying could be a overt act tying your shoes in the morning with intent to go to 
 yes but you knew that you had the file you knew the government was going to prove this and you also knew it was an overt act 
 it could have been but there are many acts 
 but your point is not that there was any prejudice here your point is that he was entitled to a grand jury 
 he was entitled to a grand jury as an independent institutional body and the problem i have with the governments point of view is that it places a judge as a reviewing authority over what a grand jury has done regardless of the standard thats applied and of course in its a rare case when you even know what a grand jury did 
 you dont have any you are not suggesting to us that the grand jury that indicted him for intentionally attempting to enter the united states at or near san luis would not have official indicted him if the indictment had gone further and said and he submitted false ids 
 there are there certainly are scenarios under which they would have indicted him yes sir 
 you think that the that the indictment had to specify which of the many things that he did or the several things that he did when he approached the border constituted the overt act that the ninth circuit he walked up to the border and he did a number of things to try to get into the united states 
 sure 
 and you think that the indictment has to specify that walking up wasnt a substantial step but presenting the documents might have been whether it was walking up presenting the documents lying to the agent you have to go into that level of detail in order to satisfy the fifth amendment 
 rule N of the rules of procedure states that the indictment must state the essential facts it need not be a memorandum of law just spelling out the elements of the crime in a general sense but it must state the essential facts in the courts case of hamling it says very clearly the language of the statute must be accompanied by such official statement of facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense coming under the general description which is charged 
 thats a separate requirement i dont know if its constitutional or not constitutional but i didnt think that requirement was at issue here the requirement of stating the facts is not the requirement of setting out the elements of the law at least thats my understanding now you can correct me if im wrong 
 well your honor based upon your hamling decision i believe thats what the court said that there must be an allegation of facts under the decision in united states versus 
 no im not denying that i just didnt think that had anything to do with this case i mean i thought that the object of the indictment initially was to set forth what crime the person was accused of and inform him of that you are saying and then there is another requirement which seems a little vague its been hard for me to find out to pin this down and its the one you state which is that it says in addition in the rule you have to have facts official i dont know if those are the same i thought they were two separate things 
 well your honor one of the functions of the grand jury indictment is to provide notice to the accused of the exact offense with which he is charged here clearly we knew he was charged with N with attempting what we did not know is which of the many many acts that the government suggested at various times which of the many acts they proved at trial would be the overt act as i say the appeal was unfair its not so much the trial was unfair it was the appeal that was unfair 
 does the government have to pick one overt act and say thats it when it introduces evidence of a whole string of them 
 well i dont see how we can really address it unless they tell us what they are talking about and i would point out as of today the government has still not identified a single act that is their overt act 
 well cant you allege that the means by which it was done are unknown but that it was by one or more of the following 
 yes you could many times in conspiracy indictments they will allege any of the official following overt acts 
 thats exactly what i i tried to read some treatises on this and the more i read the more confused i got i started out thinking well its sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on october N N in the city of such and such at the corner of such and such where there is a bank the defendant walked into the bank and he he attempted or he did by force or threat of force take property belonging to someone else or whatever it is and that that would be sufficient and that you dont have to say and in addition he you know what the force consisted of did it consist of a knife or a gun or a fist can you give me some enlightenment at least if you think thats relevant here 
 i dont think thats relevant because thats going into excessive detail the requirement is that the essential fact 
 if its excessive detail the central fact then why isnt on such and such a date at such and such a time he attempted to 
 because he did many things in furtherance of the attempt according to the governments proof and we had a right to know to have notice of the official accusation what is the government talking about 
 all right then why if thats so why wouldnt that apply as well if they said he attempted to and committed an overt act in that is a substantial step and then you are saying in addition they have to list the particular facts 
 the essential facts 
 i couldnt find any case in this court that said that i mean i found in hamling a case that went the other way a general statement they said all you have to do is say obscenity you dont have to say how obscene or in what way its obscene et cetera 
 but in the russell case they said that you have to provide the essential facts what was the nature of the committee hearing what was the subject 
 yeah yeah yeah and then russell seems lost from sight for quite a while or isnt followed a lot 
 but you come back and you tell justice breyer well thats because we had no notice but thats a different argument than the fact that there was no indictment notice can be cured by a bill of particulars by the fact that you have had a official chance to contest the evidence at trial that there was no error thats a quite different rationale than saying that this is not an indictment 
 well its not an indictment because it did not allege the essential facts 
 but that it seems to me is your argument not lack of notice 
 well it didnt provide a notice of what the essential facts was those are overlapping concepts certainly but we did not know what the facts 
 may i ask this question should the test for the missing element be different for the test for the wrong element in other words suppose the indictment alleged he walked up to the border and the evidence showed he rode a bicycle theres a variance would that present a different legal issue than if they just leave the overt act entirely out 
 that presents a different legal issue because a variance means they alleged a they proved b here they did not allege a nothing was alleged 
 why should the test for judging the two be different 
 between a variance official 
 between a variance and an omission 
 well when you have a variance the question is how much is the variance how far off is the variance 
 well its clearly different he rode a bicycle instead of walking 
 well hes given notice that hes approaching the border with intent to commit this crime 
 so here you have got notice he made an attempt but you didnt tell us whether he rode the bicycle or he walked 
 but then the question becomes is it material is the variance material is it far off from what alleged here nothing was alleged 
 see the problem im trying to think through is why should there be a different rule between those two situations it seems to me they are equally likely to produce prejudice or lack of notice and a failure to comply with the letter of the constitution 
 well the prime variance case is stirone versus united states in the N s where the court very simply said that where nothing is alleged official this cannot be treated as a simple variance 
 but why isnt your answer to justice stevens that in the case in which there is no allegation of an element at all there isnt a sufficient indictment to charge him for anything whereas in the case of the variance on your theory as i understand it there is an indictment and the question is simply whether he was misled by the variance and prejudiced 
 right 
 so why isnt the answer is in one case theres an indictment and in the other case there isnt 
 well the extent is its a question that cant be answered in the abstract its a question of how material the variance was 
 no but why isnt your answer to him that in the case in which there is a variance you have an indictment in the case that you are talking about there is none and the reason i press you on that is that i thought the essence of your case was that there is no indictment here ie the grand jury function has not been performed and he is entitled to the grand jury function before he goes to trial 
 correct 
 and if that is the nub of official your position then i would have thought your answer to justice stevens was what i suggested if thats not your answer to justice stevens then im not sure that i understand your case 
 well your honor our case is simply that where a material element is omitted the grand jury something went wrong in the grand jury proceeding and the only remedy for that is to return it the case to the grand jury and let them have a second go 
 what is the result of what went wrong how do you characterize the grand jury product in the case in which as you put it something goes wrong 
 constitutionally deficient and did not fulfill the requirements of the fifth amendment 
 an insufficient in other words there is no indictment charging a crime is that 
 thats correct your honor no crime and the reason for that i will go one step further is because theres no way of knowing whether the government 
 but thats not an element you talk about essential facts and material official i mean the statute makes it a crime to intentionally attempt to enter the united states having previously been deported and all that it doesnt say anything about presenting false identification so why are those essential facts when they are not part of what the statute prohibits 
 because that is there must be facts to show what the overt act was just providing a legal memorandum of what the elements of the offense are doesnt do any good what the constitution contemplates is that the essential facts be laid out 
 suppose this indictment charged not an attempt to enter but unlawful entry then the indictment would be sufficient right there wouldnt be any problem with it 
 well if it 
 it charged not an attempt but an unlawful entry anything missing from the indictment 
 no because thats a general intent crime theres no specific intent and no requirement that he perform any overt act 
 and the defendant could be convicted of an attempt under such an indictment could he not official 
 under such an indictment under this case he could not because he was under the constant surveillance of the ins at the time and in law that is not a legal indictment not a legal reentry an illegal reentry its one of those quirks in the law and thats why they charged the attempt to avoid these questions of whether he was under the constant control and surveillance of the immigration authorities which he was he never got by secondary so thats why the charge was attempt as opposed to unlawful entry 
 but in that situation you wouldnt know what the substantial step was would you 
 no and 
 the indictment wouldnt tell you what the substantial step was 
 and there wouldnt be any need either because its not a specific intent crime and theres no requirement 
 if the defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of attempt under an indictment charging the completed offense 
 attempt is not a lesser included the congress has intended to make attempt on the same level as the substantive offense that is the way the case law has been coming out so whether he official enters whether he attempts or whether hes found in the united states are all on an equal par its not a lesser included 
 well i dont understand that you are saying its a separate offense but a lesser included offense is a separate offense it just happens to be embraced within some other offense 
 well it has the same guideline punishment it has the same treatment as the unlawful entry and they are treated we have case law in our circuit that says i think it is corrales beltran that says the attempt is a substantive offense even though it sounds contradictory 
 what does that mean if you are tried for illegal entry and the government doesnt prove the illegal entry because you are under supervision when you get in the jury could not convict of attempt 
 if he was charged that way they probably could yes there could be a twocount indictment or there could be alternatives but that wasnt this case 
 and that would be okay just charge with attempt without setting forth the overt acts for the attempt official 
 well they would have to set out the overt act and the essential facts that constitute the overt act 
 suppose that its an assault and the indictment says on such and such a day at such and such a time he assaulted the postman right you also have to say what that he waved his fist or that he had a knife you have to say that in the indictment 
 no i dont think so 
 no all right so i thought normally essential facts means simply the facts you can state the essential facts by writing the statute and normally that tells you now is that true one case that seems to go the other way is russell 
 normally yes sir 
 normally yes 
 thats correct however in this case there is a peculiar meaning to the word attempt that when congress used the word attempt they meant to bring with that word its requirements under the common law 
 why more than any other word in the statute attempt people know what that official means 
 well they do and they dont 
 and they also know what assault means and if you tried you could spell out assault they know what robbery means but you could spell it out so why does the ninth circuit think this one you have to spell out but all the other words you dont have to 
 well thats why they had an en banc determination because the judges were in disarray over that question but at the time of this trial of the en banc decision in the ninth circuit gracidasulibarry had established concretely that the intent of the legislature was to incorporate the common law meaning of the word attempt 
 mr baggot could i come back to your answer to my earlier question you said you could only be convicted of the lesser included offense if the lesser included offense is set forth explicitly in the indictment are you sure of that 
 no sir 
 are you sure thats the law 
 no but here under N its official quite different the intent of the legislature was that the attempt would itself be a substantive offense 
 as i said in my previous question every lesser included offense is itself a substantive offense that doesnt distinguish attempt from anything else and my understanding is if you are charged with a greater offense the lesser can be a subject of conviction even though its not explicitly set forth in the indictment 
 yes thats correct 
 and if that is the case here then it seems to me he could have been convicted of attempt without ever having had set forth in the indictment the overt act that you demand 
 well thats a good point but under our all i can tell you justice scalia is that under our case law the attempt is considered a substantive offense thats been the law 
 but substantive offense is one thing lesser included i think you said earlier it couldnt be a lesser included because its subject to the same punishment so it is not lesser 
 under this statute under N thats the ruling of our circuit your honor in conclusion id just like to official emphasize that if the governments position is adapted what you will have is judges reviewing the decision of the grand jury whether or not to allege certain elements essential elements of offenses that is challenging the independence of the grand jury which is part of the structure set up by the constitution that the grand jury is a separate institution anything that the grand jury does any mistakes that are made need to be returned to the grand jury and not be reviewed by a single judge a panel of judges or an en banc or any court are there any other questions by the court 
 thank you mr baggot 
 thank you sir 
 mr dreeben you have three minutes 
 thank you mr chief justice 
 mr dreeben is attempt a lesser included offense of the substantive offense of illegal reentry 
 its a substantive offense it is an attempt offense i wouldnt necessarily official describe it as lesser included but rule N of the federal rules of criminal procedure does allow a trial judge to submit an attempt offense to the petit jury when attempt is a violation of the substantive law i should say that the governments position is that there does not need to be a separate charge of attempt in the indictment in order to permit rule N to operate but there is a circuit split over whether lesser included offenses can be submitted to the jury unless they are included in the indictment so we are not operating under a uniform rule that would always allow us to do that and im not sure which way the ninth circuit goes on that although i could hazard a guess the problem that we have here is that we are living under a rule of law in the ninth circuit and in at least one other circuit that forces the government to pay a tremendous penalty when a mistake is made in an indictment and it does happen justice souter i can assure you that judges dismiss plenty of indictments for failure to dismiss state elements but they dont get them all 
 but mr dreeben isnt the point that the tremendous cost that you refer to is a official tremendous cost that the government pays by its choice to go to trial as opposed to going back to the grand jury and making sure that it has an adequate indictment 
 well the government is often quite confident that its correct and i think if you put yourself in the position of the prosecutors in this case you can see why thats true but there are myriad rules and subrules of substantive law that this court will never review that require the government to conform with various pleading obligations they are all below the radar screen but when you have a rule of automatic reversal like this they jump up to prominence and the reason that they do is because the entire criminal justice system victims witnesses the judge the prosecutors the defense bar jurors everybody is being asked to go through a trial that was conducted on an errorfree basis by hypothesis simply because there was a mistake at the charging phase and the petit jurys verdict we submit makes it clear that that mistake does not entitle the judicial system to say lets throw it all out and start again simply as a prophylactic mechanism 
 if you concede there was an error is there anything to prevent us from saying we dont accept that concession and have you rebrief and official argue the question of whether or not an overt act is required 
 well i hope that if the court does not choose to decide the question on which it granted certiorari that it does hold that the ninth circuits substantive rule of law here is incorrect and that there was nothing wrong with the indictment 
 but can we do that in the face of your concession without having reargument 
 oh i think this court can do anything it chooses regardless of the governments concession but we are not conceding that the ninth circuit was correct we simply didnt challenge it because the important question for us is the rule of law on harmless error this pleading rule is something that we can comply with it may be wrong but its something like many wrong rules of law we live with 
 thank you mr dreeben the case is submitted 
 thank you 
 we will hear argument first today in case N sinochem international versus malaysia international shipping corporation mr castanias 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this court in ruhrgas against marathon encapsulated the relevant line of this courts precedents in the rule that we suggest controls in this case what it said it is hardly novel for a federal court to choose among threshold grounds denying audience to a case on the merits now this courts cases extending through steel company and ruhrgas and afterward hold true to this statement threshold nonmerits issues may be decided by a federal court before it determines its jurisdiction in that term meant as subject matter and personal jurisdiction this court in this case should hold the forum non conveniens is another one of those threshold nonmerits grounds for denying audience to a case that can be considered first before jurisdiction adopting that rule in this case will do three things first it will result in a rule that is most faithful to the courts precedents in the area second it will respect the rule of steel company and forbid ultra vires judgments on the merits there is no chance that a dismissal in forum non conveniens will exercise more power than is granted to the federal courts by article iii or by congress in statutes and finally it will give the federal courts the appropriate flexibility in appropriate cases to serve important interests such as economy constitutional avoidance and particularly relevant in this case international comity 
 just on the second point i wanted does the rule of the federal district court in forum non conveniens where it dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form does it have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case i know our chick kam choo precedent where we said federal court determination forum non conveniens is not binding in a state court but supposing in this case that the parties went to san francisco with a and said we want to sue there would the san francisco court the united states district court feel bound by the determination that this dispute is determined by chinese law and that the chinese court is therefore the appropriate court 
 well i think there are two components to your question justice kennedy and let me see if i can answer both of them the first is whether the determination that the federal court in philadelphia for example in this case was an inconvenient forum would that determination be binding on the court in san francisco our view would be probably not it would be persuasive in that case but the forum non conveniens 
 what about the ruling that this would be governed by chinese law and that the chinese court is the best forum to consider that that too has no lat has no effect beyond the court in philadelphia 
 let me that was the second part of your question that i was going to try to answer and with regard to that i think that it would not have preclusive effect in the main in the mine run of cases and the reason i think it wouldnt have preclusive effect is that it would be one factor in what this court has described as a multifarious analysis under the forum non conveniens analysis at american dredging and so it would be hard to say that for issue preclusion for example that the choice of law determination in that case was necessary to the ruling dismissing the case now one might imagine a case at the margins where that was the case and there might be a case for preclusive effect but thats i think not likely to be presented by this case 
 do you know any case mr castanias where there has been a forum non conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different us court to get a different resolution 
 and by us court you mean federal court like justice kennedys hypothetical or perhaps a state court as well 
 either one 
 well i think i have seen cases and i cant cite them to you as i stand here right now where litigants have tried to go to a state court another federal court i cant think of a single one im hard pressed to 
 you you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation 
 in some cases i suppose that could be true justice ginsburg but the point of our rule is that the only issue presented by this case is that of federal court power there may be a case where it is appropriate in the district courts discretion in fact in ruhrgas you writing for the court pointed out that the normal court order business is to determine subject matter jurisdiction first and then personal jurisdiction but the point of our application of that rule in this case is there may be some cases where its appropriate and this is a paradigmatic example of the sort of case where it would be appropriate to decide the forum non conveniens issue first before personal jurisdiction i hope that satisfies i hope thats an answer to your question 
 uhhuh uhhuh 
 with regard to the body of this courts decisions we cited in our briefs cases like leroy against great western which holds that a federal court can decide venue before deciding personal jurisdiction in this case its hardly different because again as american dredging pointed out forum non conveniens is properly described as a supervening venue provision the gold law case which we cite in our reply brief and the solicitor general relies on says that federal courts have the power to transfer a case before determining personal jurisdiction and grants even more analogous here are the extension in the tenet case in the case of extension extension documents have very similar though different moorings as the forum non conveniens doctrine and they are both discretionary decisions to decline to exercise jurisdiction this court pointed out citing the ellis case and it pointed this out in the steel company ruhrgas and tenet cases that extension can be decided first and again applying that precedent to the case of forum non conveniens its it really does follow that forum non conveniens can be decided first with regard to the tenet case that case is very close to a merits issue perhaps even one might call it a merits issue but it was so threshold that it was appropriate to decide the totten bar that was at issue in that case before jurisdiction again and with all of these lines of cases deciding forum non conveniens first will have will provide no chance of the federal court going beyond its constitutionally and statutorily exercised powers now id like to leave the court with one final thought about the way this and the importance of applying this rule in this case the complaint that malaysia international shipping makes against sinochem is nothing more than a claim that sinochem defrauded a chinese court there is a term used in the complaint a fraudulent misrepresentation the term negligent misrepresentation is also used but make no mistake about it the complaint in this case is that sinochem made a misrepresentation to chinese courts this is precisely the sort of interference with the chinese court system which has proceeded to judgment and judgment by the way on these issues in favor of sinochem and against malaysia international that really cries out for the flexibility inherent in our rule unless the court has further questions i will reserve the balance of my time 
 one question that doesnt even have to do with the issue before us im curious about why we are speaking of fora judicial fora there was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate what happened to that 
 im sorry i didnt hear the last part of your question 
 there was an agreement to arbitrate and we are talking about a suit brought by one party in the united states by the other party in china and no arbitration occurred apparently although i thought the contract called for it 
 my understanding justice ginsburg and this is a vague recollection from one aspect of the record is that the arbitration clause was held not to apply in this case 
 thank you 
 thats not an exercise of law declaring authority on the merits 
 oh im sorry to be clear mr chief justice it was not held by the district court in this case to not apply that issue was not in front of it but at the time 
 in other words the district court didnt hold that it didnt apply 
 yes correct i think i think that i think it was agreed by the parties or understood by the chinese court my memory on this with regard to the record maybe background facts that are not in the record but i on summing it up are a little be fuzzy but i think to answer your question mr chief justice there in abstention an an arbitration clause i think provides a closer question than this case does for an issue of whether its law declaring authority i think as your question put it its arguable that an arbitration clause is little more than a in essence a forum selection clause of the same kind that a venue provision or a forum non conveniens ruling might provide 
 it might have been the allegedly defrauded chinese court that found that the arbitration clause did not apply 
 im sorry the first part of your question i had trouble 
 it might have been the allegedly defrauded chinese court which found that the arbitration clause did not apply 
 that it may be i just i dont have that ruling in front of me 
 i dont see how that court would have gotten into the act unless that was the case 
 again we will reserve the remainder of our time for rebuttal 
 thank you counsel mr hallwarddriemeier 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in steel company the court held that it is impermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over which the court may lack jurisdiction but it is another thing entirely for the court to decline to exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess in ruhrgas clarified in language that counsel has already quoted that a court may choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits now the dividing line between a threshold nonmerits ground and a merits ground may in some cases be difficult and the court has members of the court have disagreed in some cases but there is an easier set of cases and that is where the court is declining to exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here it is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive dispute in another forum and this court has has decided already that it is permissible for example for a court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before deciding a difficult question of whether it would possess subject matter jurisdiction over the supplemental claims at all forum non conveniens is in the nature of an abstention extension doctrine in gulf oil one of the first cases of this court to describe the forum non conveniens doctrine and its factors analogizes forum non conveniens to a burford abstention the court even in steel company acknowledged that abstention on grounds of younger for example would be permissible to decide before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction 
 but the gulf oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which theres personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue its just another forum is more appropriate 
 thats thats right your honor and the court said so in the course of rejecting an argument that because it was conceded that jurisdiction and venue were proper in the southern district of new york that the doctrine of forum non conveniens could not apply the court said that couldnt be so because the doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the availability of two fora but the court did not address the entirely separate question of whether the court could assume that even i it had jurisdiction it would not exercise it and 
 it was not not felicitously put i think all the court was saying was that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction the only point of the doctrine is to get rid of the case where you where you do have jurisdiction and so you do not have to but that doesnt mean that you must establish jurisdiction before you can exercise the doctrine it is a doctrine that overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction in that sense it presupposes personal jurisdiction 
 that thats right your honor and in the court already determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or if venue was improper then forum non conveniens would have no work to do but gulf oil certainly didnt address this question of the ordering of these restful matters and of course the doctrine of forum non conveniens its entire purpose is to allow litigation to occur in a more convenient and appropriate forum and it would undermine severely the purposes of the doctrine 
 do i correctly understand your argument to be that that in this case it happened to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same argument if it were a doubt about subject matter jurisdiction 
 thats right we would and and one of the cases that ruhrgas quoted and relies on was the dc circuits decision in papandreou which involved subject matter jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunities act and there the court quite rightly said that it would be improper to force a foreign sovereign to undergo extensive jurisdictional discovery in this case when it was clear that at the end of the day the court would dismiss day in favor of a foreign forum in any event so it would apply to to questions of subject matter jurisdiction as well as personal 
 can a district court do both can it say i have reached personal jurisdiction i conclude that i we do not have jurisdiction over this case and in the alternative be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds if it turns out we do 
 i think they could do both the second would be really superfluous 
 but not if theres i presume if theres an appeal 
 if if an appeal the court could the court of appeals could affirm on either ground again to emphasize the point that counsel has made the argument here is not that forum non conveniens must necessarily be decided before jurisdictional questions in fact the natural order would be to decide jurisdictional issues first but as the court held in the analogous circumstance of venue in the leroy decision there are circumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that order such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue or as in mr papandreou avoiding imposing the burden of jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or foreign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the end in any event if the court has no further questions 
 in martin in the hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non conveniens and then they go to another federal district court could the second federal district court say this has already been heard by the first district court im not getting into it or or does that district court have have to go through the motion again 
 well i think the second court would have to at the very least ascertain that circumstances had not changed or that there werent relevant difference of facts your your hypothetical earlier was of filing refiling this suit in california 
 now why is that now to some extent this is a call for the district judge there is a degree of discretion involved in it and its entirely conceivable that one district judge would correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens whereas another district judge faced with the same question would not do so and both of them would be acting lawfully isnt that isnt that conceivable 
 it is in the nature of a discretionary determination as your honor says that that different judges could reach different decisions in the parsons case parsons versus chesapeake and ohio railway the court emphasized there the question was whether a state courts forum non conveniens determination had preclusive effect on a federal courts analysis of the factors and this court held that did it not in large part because its impossible to know that every factor would be the same or would be weighed the same by the second court and so i think it would be open to the second court to to reanalyze the issues but even if it werent even if there were some preclusive effects i dont think that that undermines our position because it is of course equally true of other threshold determinations such as personal and subject matter jurisdiction that they may have issuepreclusive effects in subsequent litigations for example a trial court could decide that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy is insufficient because under state law the plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive damage that determination would be given issuepreclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by the same plaintiff in another district court in fact justice scalia wrote an opinion on that subject in the dc circuit in the dozier versus ford motor company 
 mr hallwarddriemeier because your time is running out there is a question about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing on forum non conveniens ground and that is its common as you know to condition forum non conveniens dismissals on the defendants undertaking that the defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and other conditions if the court has no personal jurisdiction over the defendant it would be unable to impose such conditions isnt that so 
 our understanding of a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of the world and that and facts as they bear upon its analysis such as is the defendant subject to jurisdiction in a foreign forum oftentimes the plaintiff if i could answer oftentime the plaintiff objects to dismissal because they cant sue the defendant in the foreign forum the defendant agrees to waive any objection to jurisdiction that understanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal if it later proves to be untrue because the defendant objects to jurisdiction of the foreign court it would be open to the plaintiff to seek to reopen the first suit on that ground thank you very much 
 thank you counsel ms higgins 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court we believe that this court should affirm the judgment of the court of appeals for the third circuit based on three reasons we believe that personal jurisdiction is a requirement articulated in gulf oil versus gilbert which remains before this judicially created doctrine may be evaluated second we believe that adopting the third circuit holding establishes a clear bright line discrete rule that is easy to enforce and appropriate to evaluate at any other appellate level and third we argue that the nature of the doctrine of forum non conveniens itself presupposes jurisdiction before making a ruling to dismiss for some other convenient forum the analysis that has brought the case to this court has included a divergence of opinions between various circuit courts in the briefing all parties tend to agree that forum non conveniens is a nonmeritsbased ground for evaluating a ruling the fifth circuit has decided otherwise we we express some issue with the fact that in looking at a forum non conveniens analysis the court necessarily as the government has conceded in its brief takes a peek at the merits of the dispute the other issue that arises is that if a court dismisses a case based on forum non conveniens and then an appeal is sought the appellate court always has the opportunity to evaluate both the subject matter jurisdiction and the personal jurisdiction the seventh circuit in the intek versus engle case came up with such a ruling recently they expressed support for the second circuit and the dc circuit saying that it is appropriate to be able to deal with nonthreshold matters such as forum non conveniens without ascertaining jurisdiction in fact the court acknowledged that they thought the dicta expressed in the ruhrgas opinion would become the holding of this court however for judicial efficiency it decided to go through the analysis to determine whether or not there was personal jurisdiction in the case it went through subject matter of the case and personal jurisdiction and it determined that there was no jurisdiction 
 well that only proved that an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the ground relied upon by the district court even if the ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid ground its up to an appellate court its available to an appellate court especially where the ground is jurisdiction to choose to look into jurisdiction and say there isnt any i dont know i dont know how that adds to your case 
 justice scalia i think its appropriate both parties cite the vast waste of judicial resources that would occur if forum non conveniens had to establish personal jurisdiction first and frankly we see that as the other way the insight case in our opinion 
 well you found one appellate court that chose to do it that way frankly if i were sitting on an appellate panel i wouldnt do it that way if i thought the forum non conveniens ground was valid 
 well i tend to agree with you on that point as well 
 yes 
 with it but i think what the third circuit was stressing in its opinion is that you cannot subject the parties to litigate in another forum if there is some chance that your own forum does not have the personal jurisdiction it is a prerequisite of the doctrine itself and we believe that 
 may i ask this question we talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the litigants but i wonder if there isnt even a more fundamental problem with the procedure that the third circuit followed here that is is there really a case or controversy down there does the defendant have any motivation to spend a lot of money fighting about jurisdiction when he knows that the case is going to be transferred anyway is this a real live controversy on the issue thats left open 
 i think it is justice stevens and i think the court would address that by saying certainly on the negligent misrepresentation claim at this stage the record indicates that there was a ruling in china but the appellate window is still open and certainly the evidence has long gone into the chinese case those are completely separate issues 
 there couldnt be any question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction here because it in fact had a proceeding was ongoing in china so you brought up the question about the court gives up if the court dismisses on forum non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient forum doesnt take the case but that cant be a factor in this case where the other forum was in china and was indeed litigating the case 
 yes justice ginsburg but as practical matter with the resolution of this case by this court we would certainly have to start the process whatever ruling this court finds all over again we certainly cannot participate in the action in china because that has already gone on we would have the option to participate in the case in the united states because those specific issues were not litigated in china 
 im sorry im not following you so please straighten me out i thought that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on the chinese court 
 that is correct your honor 
 your claim was that a fraud had been committed on the chinese court in connection with the arrest of this vessel and the ensuing proceedings 
 that is correct justice ginsburg 
 now why in the world should a court in the united states get involved in determining whether a fraud was committed on a chinese court 
 justice ginsburg we believe it was appropriate for us review because of the balancing of the maritime commerce that occurred in the case because of the bills of ladings although the district court believed that chinese law would apply to the contract for the sale of the steel coils in fact we would make the argument that with the various charter parties in the case including the bill of lading that you reference indeed american law would apply and there would be some different issues that would be evaluated 
 american law to determine whether a fraud had been committed on the chinese court it seems just stating it that it might be offensive to the chinese court to have another court determine whether it had been defrauded 
 that would have been a concern justice ginsburg except that issue was brought up expressly before the chinese court and if i may refer you to page N of the joint appendix the chinese court ruled that quote given that the peoples republic of china and the us are different sovereignties with different jurisdictions whether the appellant has taken actions at any us court in respect of this case will have no effect on the exercise by a chinese court of its competent jurisdiction over said case 
 well that was a very polite way of the chinese court saying we dont care what the united states court is doing we have got this case we have got the ship and we are going to adjudicate it and it doesnt matter we dont have to say anything to the united states to chastise it for even thinking it could become involved in this matter it was polite 
 and i agree with you your honor except it is the only indication in the record that there is some foreign nation that has expressed an opinion on this if you read the brief by the solicitor general the government would have us think that every single case is going to involve foreign nations and delicate foreign policy disputes and such other factors very clearly there is no such evidence in the record and the only evidence we do have is from another sovereign china that says if you have a us cause of action we have no problem if a us court adjudicates it on the merits having said that the issue here was whether or not personal jurisdiction should have been decided before the forum non conveniens and again we would just go back to our second point where the court believes that it cant evaluate a doctrine without having if its a required factor of the doctrine that a sitting court making a ruling on that issue has to presuppose personal jurisdiction 
 well why i mean i assume that in deciding forum non conveniens that there is an inconvenient forum the court making that judgment would assume that there was personal jurisdiction and would simply say you know put that into the mix assuming we have personal jurisdiction is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum and if the court can say yes thats the end of the game i dont see what you have to gain here suppose the court does decide that it has jurisdiction and dismisses for forum non conveniens what what what are you gambling for here i dont understand whats the whats the desirable outcome you hope to achieve 
 well for malaysia international the desirable outcome would be upholding the third circuit opinion it then gets remanded to the district court 
 right and the district court at best for you at best finds personal jurisdiction if it finds no personal jurisdiction you know it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum non conveniens if it finds personal jurisdiction it would say oh there is personal jurisdiction but i assumed there was personal jurisdiction when i dismissed it for forum non conveniens so this is really the same call that i made before dismissed for forum non conveniens 
 and justice scalia i concede that but you would also have the ability of the defendant to waive personal jurisdiction again you get into the judicial resources the defendant could choose to waive it at that point in time and then i am right back again 
 why would a defendant that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive jurisdiction it seems to me that there is something in this picture that is to your advantage and that is if you can get the court to say well we have to do personal jurisdiction first you ask for discovery on that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens without deciding personal jurisdiction you are not going to get that discovery 
 that is correct your honor and then i would have to look for an evaluation of forum non conveniens that was favorable to the client that was one of the issues that we raised on appeal to the third circuit and the court did not make a ruling on that 
 yeah but discovery for its own sake is no fun what does discovery for its own sake achieve 
 unless theres something at the end of the discovery now maybe what you hoped is that the republic of china would not accede to the discovery and therefore you would get a default judgment or something you know i just i just dont see whats at the end of this game for you 
 thats one possibility but again we talked about the policy issues of why the government came in with the position they did they suggested that the united states had a very distinct interest in avoiding delay burdensome discovery and difficult legal issues and frankly my thought is the same as yours any party has those desires to avoid those issues and come to a ruling in their favor in this case we would hope that with an adoption of personal jurisdiction first then the court would be required to rule on our motion to reevaluate forum non conveniens and we might be able to convince the court to be able to pursuit the case here in this particular case that is the goal that we seek because that is as you say all we have to do at the end of the game with it i also wanted to 
 i guess we should ask the other side but i think i know what their answer will be whether if the court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction it must assume the existence of personal jurisdiction and what do you think 
 i think it has to your honor 
 yes i agree 
 the seventh circuit case 
 i agree so how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says oh yes you had personal jurisdiction just as you thought you did whereupon the district court says oh yeah same result 
 but there is the possibility of a case happening as it happened in the in re bridgestone case which was a seventh circuit case in that case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens and the i believe it dealt with the country of mexico the parties had obtained a ruling in mexico saying that the mexican courts were not to take jurisdiction of the case under those circumstances the court was required to take back the case because it no longer had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate the dispute so i think thats the one example of the case that you raise 
 but we know that thats not going to happen here because the chinese court has adjudicated the case 
 not on this issue your honor and actually not on the bills of lading issue you did raise that point and there is still the potential of arbitration taking place under the various charter parties to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the remaining parties in the action so that matter is still open as well 
 we are dealing with because its a foreign nation not the codified forum non conveniens thats in N and N and you are treating this as it were counterpart to N which is forum non conveniens but N is wrong venue and as you know in the goldlaw case this court said a court can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction and is a place of improper venue now why isnt the forum non conveniens doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of N and a N and if it includes N then you dont need your personal jurisdiction you dont need venue you just transfer it to a place where those conditions exist 
 i think your honor in that case its as the doctrine developed the difference lies in the statutory framework of the N versus the judicially created version of the forum non conveniens i think you are correct that as forum non conveniens exists today side by side with N you certainly have the limited application that it will apply to only foreign nations or to a state court and thats what i thought was the benefit of creating a rule thats rather limited in scope that will not touch many other factors it can be discrete it can be applied easily and that comports with federal rules of civil procedure N we thought that was one of the reasons why a finding by this court would be able to ease the administration of cases along those lines if the court has no other questions i certainly would urge that based on precedent and logic and the terms of the doctrine of forum non conveniens itself that the ruling of the third circuit be upheld thank you 
 thank you ms higgins mr castanias you have N minutes remaining 
 mr chief justice unless the court has further questions we will rest on the argument given in the briefs 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument first this morning in case N limtiaco versus camacho mr waxman 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this case is properly before this court which should reverse under the plain language and purpose of the organic act of guam as to jurisdiction at the time congress amended the organic act to replace the certiorari jurisdiction of the ninth circuit with direct review in this court the ninth circuit had already granted the writ of certiorari that had been timely filed and the case had been briefed argued and submitted the amendment said nothing about its application to pending appeals and someone had to decide whether and how it applied to this case the ninth circuit was the proper body to do that at least in the first instance and until it did this case was before that court within the meaning of gibbs versus wynn 
 mr waxman i thought the ninth circuit did decide that question in another case that was pending santos 
 it did decide it in santos justice scalia 
 why wasnt that the time at which it was clear that the ninth circuit no longer had jurisdiction 
 well for reasons that we articulate your honor in a i forget the footnote number but a footnote in our brief there are some important distinctions although they turned out not to be dispositive between the nature and position of this case and santos but in any event we know from the ninth circuit that it did not consider it otherwise because if the court will refer to i believe its page N a or N a of the joint appendix after the court decided santos it sua sponte issued an order in this case it is on page N a resubmitting this case effective february N to the ninth circuits active consideration and shortly thereafter it filed the order in this case from that in our view triggered the N N day period 
 are you suggesting that the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction a hypothetical case suppose the statute federal statute is very clear that it applies in any case would your argument be the same 
 well i wouldnt have the most the strongest argument that i have in this case i think now the courts cases are not clear here but it does seem to me that in the instance as here where it isnt just that a party has made some application or filed a cert petition with a court but the court has actually reached out and asserted jurisdiction surely anything other than an amendment withdrawing that an active withdrawing withdrawing jurisdiction that requires anything other than merely a ministerial act where there can be no possible confusion about what congress intended to do certainly anything short of that it lies with the court to ascertain it and here 
 but if we accept that in the opinion what was the phrase you used colorable jurisdiction or its something i made up i suppose is there some concept that we can refer to or some phrase that works to in order to incorporate your test that you seem to be suggesting 
 i actually would not embrace that test i think that in an instance your honor where a court in which properly had jurisdiction and affirmatively asserted it and issued and i can take the court through this a series of orders of the court following this N the october N N enactment leading up to the decision in santos and thereafter which the court continued to rule continued to issue orders in this case i think a good argument can be made that on a theory of constitutional avoidance the court ought to construe any enactment of congress no matter how pellucid it is as not constituting a selfeffecting reversal of a preexisting order of the court in which the case had been pending per order of the court and so im not sure that i would even embrace a ministerial test concept in the context in which a case is properly pending in front of a court which has affirmatively asserted jurisdiction over it and indeed here 
 mr waxman may i just ask this question i dont understand what the import of this order on page N is i have it in front of me what did that do is it anything different immediately after the order entered than 
 yes yes your honor and i think you should well i suppose you could start anywhere but lets maybe it would be as well to start on N a of the joint appendix in december N remember the guam organic act was amended i believe october N N or N and it was silent as to its effect on cases that had already been filed and were pending in the ninth circuit sua sponte the court well actually it was not sua sponte almost two months after congress enacted the organic act the respondent in this case governor camacho filed a motion on december N with the court renewing a previous motion for the court to expedite its resolution in this case and governor camachos affidavit in support of that motion is included in the joint appendix in response to the motion not telling the court hey by the way its been nice doing business with you but we have no further truck with your court because congress passed the statute and you are ipso facto by operation of law no longer in business the ninth circuit issued the order on page N a that says no opinion in this case can issue until the case of santos is decided clarifying our continuing certiorari jurisdiction over decisions from the guam supreme court then turn to page N a of the joint appendix a week later on december N the court sua sponte issues an order withdrawing and deferring a ruling in this case pending the decision in santos santos is then decided in january and on february N the court issues an order in this pending case saying okay its resubmitted to the panel and shortly thereafter the panel issued the order dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction and from that date we filed a timely petition for certiorari now the contention of the respondent in this case that the attorney general should immediately upon enactment of the organic act amendment have also filed a petition with this court would do one of two things it either would have put this court in the position of determining the effect of the amendment at the very same time that the ninth circuit was doing so which is a state of affairs that this court has repeatedly rejected most notably in andrews versus virginia railway or it would have amounted to nothing more than what this court has called quote the filing of a redundant slip of paper 
 well am i wrong i thought that the attorney general of guam did file cert in some cases that are pending or am i wrong on that 
 the attorney there were two cases in which the guam supreme court issued a final its own final ruling after the october N N amendment of the organic act and in that instance the organic act was in effect he filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this court there were two cases that were pending in the ninth circuit and over which the ninth circuit had granted the writ this case and santos in santos but not in this case the court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs with respect to the courts continued jurisdiction and the attorney general did so in this case and its discussed in our reply brief 
 mr waxman going back to what you just said isnt a third possibility the most likely possibility that this court would simply hold the petition if there were if the attorney general filed a cert petition here while the ninth circuit had not yet disposed of the case this court could have just held it because the ninth circuit was likely soon to dispose of it 
 well the attorney general could have filed a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment in this court you know at any time prior to the time that the ninth circuit issued its order dismissing jurisdiction this court has said uniformly outside the special context of threejudge courts that it will not require the mere filing of a redundant piece of paper to quote the colville indian reservation case and it has declined to extend this well why dont you just file a notice of appeal 
 theres no sense in which its redundant though it would have been the first piece of paper that this court would have seen in the matter 
 yes but that is actually what this court was referring to in the colville indian reservation case and other cases in calling it redundant in the sense that it was identical or effectively identical to a piece of paper that had invoked the jurisdiction of another court at the same time in the threejudge court context justice ginsburg although this courts jurisdiction to hear direct appeals in threejudge courts has been greatly reduced since the N s and sixties and early seventies there are certain instances that this court has realized where it is unclear whether an appeal lies to a regional court of appeals or to this court and it is unavoidable there that you would file a notice of appeal in both instances but this is not a situation in which there was any uncertainty about where the petition for a writ of certiorari from the guam supreme courts decision had to be filed the organic act said the ninth circuit had certiorari jurisdiction the ninth circuit granted the petition in this case and had assumed authority over it and so 
 but isnt it just the case you have made several arguments but you have a case thats lodged in the court of appeals its not simply a petition there they have accepted it for review 
 right 
 so in the normal course when you have a district court decision a trial court decision then you are on appeal and the case is fully lodged in the court of appeals its like the judgment is suspended until the appellate court is done so you have no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace else until that judgment is entered i think thats the essence of your argument isnt it 
 yes and in fact i mean its i dont think that anything actually turns on this in the context of this case but it is quite significant that at the time there has yet never been any appellate determination of the substantive question in this case the guam supreme court considered this as a court of first instance that original petition was filed in the guam supreme court and the ninth circuit court of appeals at the time that the attorney general filed the petition for a writ of certiorari was the only place the attorney general of guam could go to get review of this construction by a territorial court sitting as a trial court in the first instance of an act of congress 
 does it make any difference that the review was discretionary in the ninth circuit what if before the act was passed there was an appeal as of right to the ninth circuit wouldnt your argument be exactly the same 
 it would be exactly the same we just think that given the fact that this is an instance in which the ninth circuit granted the writ of certiorari and issued both before both before the amendment and after the amendment and both before santos and after santos orders reflecting the fact that it believed it continued to have authority over this case the appropriate outcome in this case is more straightforward than it might be in some other closer instances 
 perhaps you should go on to the merits 
 thank you 
 and on that i have a preliminary question because we have a new attorney general and the question is whether the new attorney general continues to oppose the legislature and the governor on this bond issue do in other words do we still have a case or controversy 
 yes justice ginsburg we do i have spoken personally and repeatedly with the attorney general who is with me at counsel table who has instructed me unequivocally to continue vigorously to advocate the construction of the organic act that reflected in our petition and in our merits and reply brief 
 i have a more basic question whether we had a case or controversy to start with this is kind of an intramural dispute between two guamanian officials about what guams position should be with respect to the organic act and im wondering why thats a justiciable controversy under article iii the cases you cited in your petition all involved on its only facially intra interbranch disputes within the federal government but the agencies in those cases always were representing a real party in interest united states versus icc the icc was actually the railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled why shouldnt we just let guam figure out its position on its own and then when a private party with standing challenges something then we will have a case or controversy 
 well mr chief justice this is actually an a fortiori if you dont agree with me and you think that there really wasnt a case or controversy then we would respectfully submit the appropriate resolution would be to dismiss and vacate the guam supreme courts decision so that the attorney general 
 oh no guam presumably some state courts issue advisory opinions we dont thats their business its just a question of whether we have jurisdiction to address the question in that context 
 indeed but heres the situation here and this is why i think its an a fortiori case the attorney general and the governor of guam are each separately elected they each have nondiscretionary obligations under guam law in addition to their obligation to interpret and enforce the constitution and laws of the united states the attorney general cannot be removed by by the governor by guam law unlike the case in many of these federal executive branch intramural disputes and she is required by guam law in any instance in which the governor and the legislature attempt to borrow money subject to the full faith and credit of the territory to certify that such borrowing is lawful and in this instance therefore she is as the unremovable elected chief law enforcement of the territory she is required both to properly apply the federal law that the organic act that constitutes guams constitution and guam territorial law which requires her affirmatively to certify the legality of the proposed buyin 
 except that she is removable by election and that is indeed what has happened and i understand that one of the issues in the election was precisely whether this borrowing authority existed or not and if thats the case you have a new attorney general that presumably as an original matter would not do what the prior attorney general did 
 justice scalia 
 so it is an intrabranch dispute that can be resolved by the electorate essentially 
 there may very it may very well occur in fact there either is or imminently will be a proposed additional borrowing of $N million proposed by the governor to the legislature and that is going to require this attorney general to ascertain presumably prior to the time this court well i wont presume but perhaps before this court renders a decision in this case were it to whether she can or cannot certify that now the answer to that question will turn in the first instance and shes not going to be reelected before then she cant be removed by the governor before then her position is that if she ascertains that in the form in which its enacted that proposed borrowing implicates you know constitutes debt within the meaning of section N she will not sign that legislation and that it seems to me during the campaign of course none of this is in the record her position was that she would continue to pursue this litigation in the supreme court which is why shes here 
 i guess im not quite sure what that means i mean its one thing to say i will pursue the litigation because it would be a good thing to have a definitive answer from someone other than the governor or me is it her position at the present time that the position of her predecessor is correct or not 
 it is her position that if she were presented tomorrow with a borrowing that would exceed the debt caps under the position of the attorney general in this case she will not sign it because that constitutes her interpretation of the law 
 so she adopts the interpretation of her predecessor 
 correct 
 i have a question if i can if we should reach the merits of the case 
 i think you should reach the merits of the case 
 i know that that isnt it i have a question about i have a question about the merits 
 okay i have four reasons why i think we are correct 
 i know but i have a question id like you to go into 
 okay 
 i looked up my law clerk has and found eight states that seem roughly comparable those that go to assessed value every single one of them and most of them do they have the word like assessment the only comparable places we found are puerto rico philippines in N and guam here which dont use the word assessment but use the words aggregate taxable value all right now whats happened in those places we know whats happening in guam i cant with the philippines in N and puerto rico there ought to be some experience there even if we couldnt find a case how they treated it 
 well they whats happening in all those jurisdictions will certainly consume at least the rest of the balance of my time the simple answer is that is the following there are looking first at the states there are states that use the term the valuation there are states that use the assessed valuation aggregate assessed valuation and there are a few states that use tax valuation it is uniformly the case in the states and elsewhere that the word assessed in this context is understood to refer to the valuation against which the property tax is based whether that happens to be a place where it is full value or a fractional value but it is also the case that at the time that the guam supreme that the guam organic act was enacted fractional valuation was a commonplace for purposes of assessing property tax now in the territories 
 try utah try iowa try 
 there were three states that we discussed passy is one halsey is the other and i cant remember the name of the other one where they used where the state constitution just said aggregate valuation or the valuation and the state supreme court said theres no modifier for valuation that must mean full value there are conversely the state supreme court in fishburn in the illinois context and in the indiana context where even that formulation the valuation the state supreme court said come on it is the debt limitation is always calculated 
 mr waxman can i ask you this just about guam not about the other territories is there anything in the organic act that would prevent guam from changing the assessed percentage from N percent to N or N 
 absolutely nothing 
 so theres no no limit in the organic act of any real meaning 
 thats the limit in the organic act and it makes it entirely consistent with all of the other territories that i are not that many and i will explicate which is the uniform rule has been that the basis for valuation of property against which the debt limitation percentage is multiplied is the same as the valuation of property against which the property taxes apply and in the territories the congress has used essentially two formulations in the springer act it was assessed value of taxable property in alaska it was aggregate taxable value in guam its aggregate tax valuation in hawaii it was assessed value in the northern marianas aggregate assessed valuation the philippines which you mentioned is a particularly instructive example because in N and N it was assessed valuation but then in N and N it was altered to be aggregate tax valuation and then the virgin puerto rico is aggregate tax valuation and the virgin islands which we have discussed is aggregate assessed valuation now the legislative histories of these provisions including the guam provision are lengthy obscure and frankly have been very difficult to obtain because in many instances the hearings are unreported and we have been receiving the legislative history particularly the unpublished legislative histories of these provisions up to and including saturday because in the N days over the christmas holiday in which we did our reply brief we simply could not get hearing transcripts of hearings that were conducted in N in that agana guam but we are prepared to lodge the relevant provisions with the court for the court and i dont want to therefore dont want to make any argument about it but i dont want to say that these words 
 please dont 
 but the 
 my question is the following in puerto rico and in the philippines after N and in alaska were there any instances in which they issued bonds that exceeded the N percent of the assessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value they either did or didnt and that shouldnt be hard to find out 
 i think that would be hard to find out and i dont know i do know that there is legislative history with respect to the use of the word assessed and tax in this context both in puerto rico and in the philippines i dont know about alaska 
 just on the merits the first thing that the tax authorities have to do is they have to value the property 
 correct 
 and they are valuing it for tax purposes so that sounds like tax valuation 
 im not our argument is that the word tax valuation has to have meaning and the plainest meaning is the meaning we respectfully submit the most natural meaning of tax valuation is the valuation that is used by guam for the calculation of tax and thats true not only as a matter of plain language but for three other reasons first of all as i indicated it puts guam in harmony with the regime that has existed in every other us territory in which the value of property against which the debt limitation rate is assessed is the same as the value of property against which the tax rate is assessed and secondly or thirdly that fully accords with the statutory and legislative history both with respect to the territories and the states that reflects that it has always been understood that tax valuation and assessed valuation are equivalent in this context and understanding that furthers congresss consistent goal of restraining borrowing by territories and finally interpreting tax to mean full renders the word tax all but meaningless i grant you justice kennedy that it is possible to come up with a meaning it is not a meaning that the guam supreme court adopted but it is a possible meaning but the guam supreme court interprets actually said in its opinion tax has to mean something it interpreted tax not to modify valuation the word that follows it but to modify the word property and to read it as taxable property which is with all respect plainly wrong 
 there are big lenders in the united states and those people dont fool around they get opinions and they lend money to puerto rico or they lend money to some of these places they are going to have opinion letters and those opinion letters are going to say whether they think in their opinion this is over reaching to many bonds or not and of course i would think those opinion letters would say for puerto rico what the words aggregate tax valuation mean they might or might not in other words im trying to find ways of getting the tax 
 okay i dont have any such opinion letters and i would therefore much like to reserve at least a minute for rebuttal but with respect 
 now mr waxman we have taken a fair amount of your time before you got to the merits so we will give you a couple of minutes for rebuttal why dont you answer that 
 thank you with respect to puerto rico puerto rico happens to be a situation which so far as we have been able to ascertain the law actually requires that for purposes of determining valuation for application of the tax rate the assessed rate is required to be the actual value as is the case in the virgin islands so that distinction wouldnt exist on the other hand in the philippines it is clear from N on that a system of fractional valuation was in place now getting figuring out what actually happened in the philippines way back when when it was a territory of the united states has been challenging and its may very well be that there is information but simply simply obtaining for example the the three unpublished hearings with respect to the virgin islands legislation in N has been actually surprisingly surprisingly challenging if i may reserve the balance of my time 
 thank you mr waxman ms brinkmann 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court this case should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction because the certiorari petition filed in this court to review the judgment of the guam supreme court was untimely if the court were nonetheless to reach the merits of the opinion of the case the opinion of the guam supreme court interpreting section N of the organic act should be affirmed there are three principal reasons supporting both of these positions first on the dismissal dismissal is required one because when the ninth circuit was divested of authority to adjudicate the merits of the case on october N th N this court was then the only court that could review that judgment 
 ms brinkmann congress sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts but while the case is spending it isnt until the court issues the order theres no automatic dismissal of the case when congress passes an act there is a case lodged in the court and that court will follow congresss directions and dismiss it but until it does its hold final judgment the judgment of the guam supreme court is suspended while its sub judicata before the ninth circuit and then when the ninth circuit acts then there is a trigger but until there isnt 
 your honor we respectfully disagree we dont believe that there was any suspension of the time for filing once the ninth circuit was divested of jurisdiction this court as long ago as the eisenberg case has recognized that the time for filing certiorari is suspended so long as a lower court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the case the court reinforced that more recently 
 what if what if you have an ambiguous statute where it really is not clear whether it applies to pending cases or not what what you say if it turns out after the fact that it does apply to pending cases you are out of time if you havent immediately filed here while the case is still is still pending 
 no your honor that is the situation that the court confronts in the threejudge district court cases within in the instances in which there was a mistake made as to where the appeal should be taken and the court has jurisdiction to decide the jurisdiction in those instances has vacated and remanded the order i want to emphasize to this court that in the santos case petitioner requested that the ninth circuit remand the order to the guam supreme court and in the language of this court what that does is it refreshes the judgment of the guam supreme court so that it can timely brought here if petitioner 
 may i ask would the ninth circuit have had jurisdiction after october N N to vacate the judgment of the guam supreme court and send the case back 
 yes we believe under the authority of this court in those threejudge courts that is the solution that this court has established 
 we did that we dont have jurisdiction but we are nevertheless going to enter the following order which presumably depends on our having jurisdiction that the judgment is vacated assuming its bad you agree that the ninth circuit could have done that 
 yes your honor petitioner agreed that he asked for that relief in the santos case 
 isnt that subject to gamesmanship parties that are out of time in this court going to a lower court and saying well just vacate and reenter and then i can start all over again we have discouraged that 
 we think not your honor in the donovan ricky richland case the court made clear you would not vacate it when it was simply a failure to obey the rules the court refused to vacate and remand in that case as we point out in our brief this is a case such as justice scalia was positing where there is an actual issue of colorable question of jurisdiction the proper course would to be to challenge and here petitioner did not even try to litigate the question did not file any brief after santos came down never tried to distinguish this case from santos he merely waited and did not timely pursue the writ of the guam supreme court the judgment that was final at that point in time 
 well youd say santos then is is is the rubicon not the enactment of the statute but santos 
 no we believe in this particular instance particularly on with the clarity under brunner of the divestiture of the ninth circuit jurisdiction here this is not a rule of force 
 yeah your last argument then is irrelevant i mean if its clear it doesnt matter what they did before 
 well im suggesting in response to your question justice scalia that in those other situations where there may be a question that does not put the petitioner in a situation of not being able to seek review 
 which is not this case 
 thats correct your honor 
 the ninth circuit would have been without authority to issue the orders in santos under your reasoning the ninth circuit is powerless because the authority had been transferred by virtue of the statute to this court so the ninth circuit was wrong in any orders it issued 
 no your honor the ninth circuit maintained jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction and indeed if petitioner had litigated the question of jurisdiction they could have brought a writ to the ninth circuit and come to this court and litigated the question of jurisdiction if the court had found there was jurisdiction it could have reached the merits if the court had found it was not there was no jurisdiction it would have in the threejudge courts and said no you need to come directly up from the guam supreme court with vacate and remand for a fresh judgment and then you come to the guam supreme court 
 may i ask how much time did the petitioners have after the statute passed N days or the interval of N days minus whatever had been run 
 N days your honor we believe that the 
 why would that be so 
 the timely petition to the ninth circuit and the grant of certiorari would have suspended the finality of the guam supreme court judgment once congress in its authority to demarcate the jurisdictions of the lower federal courts had passed that the statute it was no for no court to question that was divested jurisdiction at that time the guam supreme court judgment was again final and it had N days to petition i should say there are other cases eisenberg makes clear that time was not suspended when the court below does not have jurisdiction the market street railways case makes clear when as a matter of law the lower court no longer can act on the case the time is no longer suspended and the jesse oil case makes clear that the party can not rely on a false exercise of jurisdiction by the lower court 
 well in this case if it was not a false exercise in santos why was it a false exercise here 
 it was not a false exercise your honor until october N of N at that time congress spoke and what that 
 but it it it was still an exercise it was an exercise in this case of the same authority that it was purporting to exercise in santos which you conceded and that is the authority to determine its own jurisdiction i presume that jurisdiction is determined on a case by case basis when a case has already been accepted by the court and as justice ginsburg said is sub judice so if there was if there was jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction in santos i dont see why there wasnt likewise jurisdiction to determine it here 
 there was jurisdiction your honor our position is the same in both of those cases and indeed if that issue of jurisdiction had been litigated in this case petitioner could have brought a writ to the ninth circuit judgment and litigated jurisdiction in this case but if the courts ultimately determined that there was not jurisdiction it had 
 once the once the ninth circuit determined that it had no longer a continuing jurisdiction to do anything more than it did in the order that finally dismissed this the other side wasnt bound to litigate that here all the other side is saying is that up to that point the court was determining its own jurisdiction and therefore it is only when it determined that its jurisdiction no longer existed that the filing period began to run so it seems to me that the crucial question is if it could determine its own jurisdiction in santos which you concede why cant it determine its own jurisdiction here 
 it can your honor but 
 isnt that what it was doing 
 yes but if it is found there is no jurisdiction then the party cannot have relied on that to suspend 
 why why cant it 
 because this courts cases make clear the wynn eisenberg case 
 but those those are they and you have got me here the argument here is that the that the ninth circuit already had taken jurisdiction in this case it wasnt a question of whether to accept it or not 
 and in those cases your honor the courts also appellate courts were undoubtedly exercising jurisdiction in those cases and in eisenberg for example it was a request to recall the remittitur it took months for the california supreme court to decide that case and they said yes theres a standard where you can do that there the court we find you dont make it so we dont have jurisdiction they came to this court and said out of time you had to have sought our review timely from the final judgment of the california supreme court you could not wait for that period of time in which the california supreme court decided to not have jurisdiction 
 i 
 that is a well established federal jurisdiction principle 
 i guess im still at a loss on the point that for one purpose the purpose of the N day filing period you are saying that the ninth circuit did not have jurisdiction but for another purpose the determination of whether it had jurisdiction you are saying it does have jurisdiction am i misunderstanding your argument 
 i dont believe so i think thats very common 
 i dont see how you can have it both ways 
 well this court has made clear for example in the threejudge district court cases that this court has jurisdiction when an appeal comes before it to decide whether or not it has jurisdiction over that appeal when parties have made 
 maybe i should say i dont know why this court can have it both ways 
 dont dont we have to choose one analytical path or the other analytical path 
 no your honor i think it rests in this whole idea that courts have to have jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction but when you are 
 and then when they decide they didnt have jurisdiction then its retroactive thats what your position is 
 no 
 the ninth circuit has jurisdiction this whole time but the day that it issues its decision dismissing this case then it is retroactive back to the date that congress passed the statute thats what you seem to be saying 
 the divestiture of the jurisdiction occurred on the date that congresss statute went into effect 
 what if what if the ninth circuit had incorrectly held that it had jurisdiction would it be the same 
 your honor that would have been the scenario i discussed before the parties could have litigated that if it came to this court and the court found there was jurisdiction so be it we think it would have been a wrong ruling and if it came to this court and this court reversed that is the scenario we discussed where in the threejudge district court when that turns out the court says we dont have jurisdiction you needed to come up through the other route we will dismiss vacate and send back and come up now i have to urge on the court theres a purpose for that in those cases the party is actively believing and pursuing the view that jurisdiction exists in this case that was not the scenario 
 but those cases really are not on point because there was a vast confusion in the days when there was a threejudge court do i file a jurisdictional statement do i file a cert petition sometimes this court said we will treat the jurisdictional statement as a cert petition but those existed from the beginning here theres a case lodged in the court of appeals the court of appeals had every basis of jurisdiction this was no big shakes about it it wasnt did they file the right paper and then congress does something and the court would follow suit it just seems to me very strange to say the court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction but if it decides it doesnt then the date of that order is not the critical date but you go back to the date that congress passed the law 
 your honor i think that this court addressed this scenario and one of two things could have happened as you pointed out during petitioners argument it would have been an easy thing to file a protective cert position this court is well familiar has recognized the appropriate of protective filings certainly in the federal habeas situation where there are mixed petitions and we go back in thought protective filing within the N day period would have been appropriate and i urge particularly because petitioner filed a brief within that period in the santos case recognizing that brunner required that there was a divestiture of ninth circuit jurisdiction as of the day of the statute enactment even if there had not been that protective filing if petitioner had a colorable jurisdiction argument and litigated it this court has made clear that once that has been determined adversely there can be a vacation and remand back to the guam supreme court so that judgment can be brought up i would like to turn to the merits if i could your honor we believe that the wellreasoned opinion of the guam supreme court should be affirmed for three reasons first the interpretation takes full account of the text of the statute as justice kennedy was mentioning before the purpose of this is to have a debt limitation that is based on the property in guam and the tax valuation of that property in guam the tax valuation is the valuation of the property that is subject to tax this is not an original interpretation of this provision in the superior court opinion from N that we attached to our brief in opposition the guam supreme court came to the same conclusion and interpretation of this language we think it is an eminently reasonable and correct interpretation particularly in light of the absence of the word as set 
 but dont you know that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this statute i mean your position would be exactly the same if it just said N percent of the value of the property in guam 
 no your honor that would include the taxexempt property that would be a much larger number 
 thats where im having trouble on your side i cant get very far with a history of other places apparently i cant get there tax doesnt seem to help me very much so i thought well one thing is clear what they are trying to do here is they take out of the box if you look at it take all of the list of property that they dont tax i guess a school maybe some tax exempt business or something 
 now their reason for doing that must be that those people who they have exempted entirely by statute are not going to be much help in paying guam well if thats true isnt precisely the same thing true of the twothirds of the property that they dont take into account when they set their taxes 
 no your honor 
 because 
 because that property in guam is still securing this debt to a certain degree it is property that must be valued for tax purposes 
 no it doesnt secure it one bit if in fact the tax statute says you cant take it into account when you set your taxes just as is true of lets say a tax free business of some kind now guam doesnt have to do that it could change its statute but so could it change its statute in respect to a school a university or whatever the other things are that are off those tax rolls you know that you know your answer was circular that assumes that the whole property is but it isnt 
 well your honor as a matter of textual interpretation as to the tax valuation of property in guam you look at the property in guam and then you have to take the tax valuation you are taking the property that is subject to tax we believe that this is the intent of congress also for two reasons justice breyer that addressed your issues before about one suggestion that guam could change this the purpose of congress here was to set a meaningful debt limit that is what real value appraisal value does it is an economic determination of currency fact 
 well why why does it do any more than the N percent value that sets a definite limit 
 because that could be changed at the whim of the legislature your honor and the legislature could change that assessment to increase the debt limit and while lowering taxes and altering any tax liability 
 with respect to much of the tax exempt property that could be changed by the legislature as well 
 but when you are looking to a bond debt limitation you are looking at the bond market you are looking at investors the certainty of an appraisal value actual real value and 
 but it doesnt have to be N percent they could change what you call the tax valuation from N percent of the fair value to N percent theres really much less to this case than meets the eye i mean guam is going to be able to fiddle with this thing no matter how you come out 
 we dont believe that was the intent of congress 
 well whether it was their intent or not is it not the case that guam could say all property will be valued at N percent of its fair market value and we will then impose a N percent real estate tax instead of the N percent or instead of the N percent we had before 
 yes they certainly could do that as a matter of fact we dont believe that should alter the debt limitation congress enacted and thats precisely why we believe that the guam supreme court opinion gives a meaningful interpretation of the purpose of congress and gives a real debt limitation that exactly should be affirmed as exactly the purpose that congress intended and thats why the assessed value can be so easily manipulated and is not a reasonable interpretation i also would like to address justice breyers question about the 
 no just before you go there if i were a bond investor i would much prefer issuing bonds if its the lower value if its the assessed value im just more secure 
 your honor the uncertainty however that the debt limitation is a real limitation that serves the purpose of congress in order to have some kind of fiscal responsibility to the territory is what is furthered by the real limitation of having a concrete appraisal full value as a basis for the calculations 
 well you do have a concrete appraisal but its just reduced to N percent 
 but that can be changed at the whim of the legislature without any accountability to the voters because at the same time that they change the tax rate and not alter any tax liability 
 well you say without any responsibility to the voters i mean the voters are going to know that if the valuation is changed and the tax rate isnt their taxes are going up so i assume the voters are going to be vigilant to what is going on and i assume they have telephones and they will call their representatives why is this why do you posit this sort of failure of representative democracy 
 because i assume the tax rate will be changed so its not just theres no 
 but if the tax rate is changed they are going to call twice 
 no the tax rate will be changed to be lower to maintain the same level so there would be no because the legislature isnt acting to address any tax liability they are simply asking to manipulate the debt limitation which is very contrary to the purpose and any meaningful message that debt limitation 
 but they are going to know this i mean they are going to be if they are concerned at all about it they will be in touch with their representatives 
 your honor of course the bond issuance here also goes to the guam legislature and they are held accountable for that in the political arena i would suggest your honor the question about i agree with petitioners counsel about the certainty of determining some of this historical material is difficult and not precise but we have gone back and looked at the contemporaneous statutes in each of these territorial jurisdictions and as mr waxman pointed out puerto rico it turns out actually uses the actual value all of them use the actual value 
 do they tax on the basis of the 
 yeah 
 this is a fractional this N percent in the other places do they use as the the value taxed N percent of the property 
 yeah 
 and then just have a lower tax rate 
 yes 
 and what was the appraisal practice i mean in a lot of these jurisdictions you have appraised value that turns out to be N percent of the actual market value 
 but here in the virgin islands and alaska federal law requires that the taxes be imposed on the actual value in the virgin islands it said your assessment will be actual value thats why the term assessment was used in the virgin islands debt limitation because that was in a preexisting federal statute that required assessment be an actual value 
 which one you say they have all used market values 
 yes 
 well which of the ones that use it have in fact an assessed value that is a percentage of market value 
 none 
 all right well that doesnt help us then 
 but i think it does further the purpose of what congress was looking to in both the virgin islands and alaska the requirement for various reasons that they impose their tax on the actual value certainly supports the reasonableness of the interpretation here your honor 
 well we could look at hawaii in hawaii they use the word assessed value they couldnt possibly have wanted it to be market value i wouldnt think 
 but the actual 
 and in the district of columbia where are we on this its something else in dc they use assessed value in the virgin islands 
 the preexisting law in hawaii before it became a territory had tax imposed on the actual value and subsequent to the debt limitation the territorial law also put it on actual value i would suggest your honor certainly if there is any debate that theres more than one interpretation of the organic act that deference should be afforded to the guam supreme courts interpretation of that that is well established under this court 
 but doesnt it who is this provision designed to protect just the guamanian taxpayers or federal taxpayers more generally 
 its the guamanians your honor it is not 
 if the guamanian government runs a deficit where is the difference made up from 
 most of the income and revenue on guam comes from the federal income tax because unlike on the mainland the federal income tax goes to the guam treasury rather than the united states treasury 
 i know that any taxes from guam are returned to guam are additional tax revenues given to guam other than those that are derived from guam 
 yeah other financial relationships with the us government yes your honor 
 so that if the guamanian treasury runs into difficulty its made up not just by guamanian taxpayers but by all federal taxpayers 
 no your honor thats not my understanding of the practice the encouragement of congress setting up the independent judiciary and government of guam has also included fiscal responsibility and part of that are the bond issuance and the issues that are here before the court 
 i cannot imagine that if a territory of the united states goes belly up that the united states is not going to foot the bill i just cant imagine that 
 your honor we believe here that the debt limitation is a matter of local concern it is the constitution of guam and we are not suggesting that the court affirm an erroneous interpretation at all this is a more than reasonable interpretation of a theory well reasoned opinion by the guam supreme court the guam supreme court has support its N year old superior court opinion that had reached the same conclusion that was the only law out there that guamanians had looked to for the interpretation of those provisions of the organic act it predated the N appraisal and it took that opinion and did not simply adopt it but went through and did a very detailed analysis of the test of the statute of the organic act the fact that it did not include the word assessed which was used N months later by congress in the virgin islands 
 miss brinkmann just to follow up on justice scalias question is there any history of the federal government having to bail out the guam government for bankruptcy or anything close to that 
 no your honor none whatsoever 
 and is there anything in the record that tells us what kind of a credit rating guam has 
 no your honor i dont believe it does 
 did this value issue i mean was the borrowing effective given the controversy between the attorney general refused to sign did that have any consequences for whether this bond issue went through 
 absolutely your honor because of petitioners delay for more than a year and a half in a court that did not have jurisdiction these bonds still have not been able to issue and petitioner responded no as a practical matter the bond market will not support issuance of these bonds until attempts to undermine their validity have been brought to an end and so the guam government has been doing different means of financing in a positive manner the economy of guam has returned because of many of the devastating world events have taken have passed in time and the economy is recovering the us military is returning with a very large presence there but they are still my understanding approximately two years behind in getting back tax returns 
 in that case you should want us to exercise jurisdiction decide it one way or the other 
 your honor we believe that it should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction the guam supreme court opinion stands and we prevail under that ruling the guam supreme courts interpretation of section N of the organic act 
 could you tell me whether the rate of tax is uniform throughout guam the rate of real estate tax is it an islandwide tax or is it local county 
 it is an islandwide tax your honor land is taxed at onequarter of N percent and improvements are taxed at N percent 
 i dont know why you just didnt raise your assessed value from N percent to N percent and reduce the rate of tax accordingly 
 we dont believe that congress intended to inject itself into the workings of this local territorial tax mechanism the various policies 
 but you still have the option and im just dying to ask the question not having anything to do with the case why did they do this why did they have was it just to make everybody feel good and they think they are ripping off the government because they are getting only a N percent value even though everybody knows they will just raise the rate if it changes 
 that is exactly the kind of policy decision that the local governing authority makes about taxes actually the petitioner has a footnote explaining the origin of fractional tax valuation indeed it seems to be consistent with some of the history also that we have seen that there would be informal adjustments of valuations to take into account perhaps poverty or to take into account less meritorious justifications and the because of the perception or i believe petitioner calls it the political psychology perhaps of having such a high rate that is a policy decision that different taxing authorities make it should not mean that guam surrenders twothirds of its debt limitation congress did not use the word assessed and its a very difficult argument to adopt that by failing to use assessed they limited it to an assessed value that surrendered twothirds of the guam territorial debt limitation contrary to all 
 yeah but you talked about this as the deference we owe to the guam supreme court this is a federal statute right this was passed by congress 
 yes your honor and in the santa fe case versus friday with all due respect petitioner is incorrect that that addressed territorial laws that was a provision in the new mexico organic act that fed up the jurisdiction of district courts that congress created in new mexico there was a provision in that organic act provision of new mexico that said the jurisdiction of those courts was as limited as law that passage was interepreted in this court in friday looking at another federal statute and some territorial laws i would direct the court to the briefs in the case that opinion itself was quite brief and when you look at the explications of the party it simply reinforces that the court there was construing an organic act a federal statue and local territorial statutes and there directly said that they should defer to the local understanding of the courts unless it is clearly wrong so we urge that that too should be 
 does that apply to all the provisions of the organic act i mean there are provisions there addressing the jurisdictional issue that we are considering here as well do we defer to the guam supreme courts view on that 
 your honor i see my time is up but if youd like me to respond 
 thats fine 
 i think that you could look to your area of administrative deference for example under chevron where you do also defer to the authority of an agency the interpretation of an agency the determination of its own authority the court has upheld thank you your honor 
 thank you ms brinkmann mr waxman we will give you N minutes 
 thank you mr chief justice i want to direct the court in response to two questions that were asked of ms brinkmann i want to direct the court to two pages of the guam supreme courts opinion and im going to summarize them for you now but for purposes of whats the difference between in terms of bond holders the fact that certain property isnt taxed at all and certain property is only taxed at N percent whats important to note here and that is reflected at page N a of the petition appendix the tax roll on guam includes a valuation of all nontaxable property the guam supreme court then has to go back and say well of this approximately N million is exempt so in guam the tax assessor and the guam courts are treating property that is wholly exempt from taxation the same way that it treats the twothirds of fair market value that is exempt from application of the tax rate secondly in response to justice kennedys questions about why are we focusing why wouldnt bond holders focus on assessed valuation rather than the rest and what difference does all of this make page N a of the joint appendix which is footnote N of the guam supreme courts opinion which comes in the the portion of the opinion where the court says look tax has to mean something we think it means taxable property not tax valuation the guam supreme court in its opinion in footnote N quoting from some language from a dissenting opinion in the hawaii supreme court says as follows and im quoting from footnote N it has been argued that the use of a percentage of assessed value as a measure of the state debt limit is without significance now skipping the rest of the sentence the people that buy the bonds are interested in the ratio of your debt to your assessed value because while all of the tax revenues of the state or the counties naturally are available for the payment of the debt its been customary for bond holders to look to the real property tax as their collateral that is the authority on which the guam supreme court relied and it applies to this case and it explain why the word assessed and the word taxable have been construed synonymously and interchangeably in the legislative history of these territorial statutes and why assessed value is understood to be usually fractional value for reasons of political psychology that ms brinkmann addressed but even where its full value it is only pursuant to a determination that for assessment purposes full value should be used 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument this morning in case N hein versus freedom from religion foundation general clement 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court in flast against cohen this court recognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer could satisfy the requirements of article iii in challenging a congressional exercise of its spending and taxing authority this court in doing so rejected the suggestion of justice douglas that it allow all taxpayers to sue in all manner of claims as well as the slightly more modest suggestion of justices stewart and fortas that the court allow taxpayer standing for all establishment clause challenges this courts subsequent cases such as valley forge have made clear just how narrow the rule of flast is in order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements of article iii the taxpayer must challenge a congressional exercise of the taxing and spending authority and assert that the act of spending itself is what gives rise to the establishment clause violation the court of appeals in the decision below substantially expanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so the court adopted a doctrine that i think can fairly be only understood as an exception to not an application of normal principles of article iii standing the court did so on the rationale that there is much that the executive branch can do to violate the establishment cause but there is much that all three branches of government could conceivably do to violate the establishment clause and that has never been thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer standing to all government action nor has it been thought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible minimum requirements of article iii 
 if i understand your position correctly if congress enacts a program that favors religion over nonreligion which is supposedly what the establishment clause prohibits thats bad but if congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and the president implements it in a fashion that favors religion over nonreligion thats okay insofar as the ability of anybody to challenge it is concerned is that an accurate description 
 well i dont think so justice scalia i mean first of all 
 why not 
 i mean i think that may be sort of over inclusive and under inclusive 
 okay 
 which is to say its not a congressional program its a congressional spending statute that is the key predicate and then once theres a congressional spending program whether its facial challenge or an asapply challenge that relies on an intervening ministerial act of the executive branch taxpayer standing will lie under this courts precedent 
 if this if congress had enacted this executive order thats in question here if it had been congressional legislation would there be standing 
 i dont think so justice ginsburg but let me just be clear i dont think its just a matter of this executive order thats challenged in this case and congress could have enacted that into statute as i understand it the what is really at issue here is not the executive order it is the way that certain conferences were conducted by executive branch officials thats what the dispute 
 i had the same question as justice ginsburg and i think was also suggested by justice scalias question suppose that congress passed a statute that said we hereby appropriate a million dollars to the president to use to call religious conferences and then it spelled out these conferences is there standing there 
 i dont think so justice kennedy because i look at this courts 
 but and i of course want the answer but then why is that consistent with what you told us at the beginning that there had to be a statute 
 because there has to be two things there has to be a statute and then there has to be an allegation that the statute creates a unique injury in the context of spending that affects taxpayers differently than anybody than any other citizen and if you have a situation like your hypothetical statue where you dont have any spending that goes outside of the government then you might have an establishment clause problem but it wouldnt be an establishment clause problem where the nub of the problem is the fact that money is spent because if theres a problem with whats going 
 so you are saying if the government the executive or the congress if the congressional statute authorizes the giving of money for the billing of a church thats bad but if it authorizes it makes a general authorization to the president no if the congressional statute says the government will build a church thats okay because then the money doesnt go outside the government 
 well importantly justice scalia its not a matter of it being okay its a question of whether it logically 
 well as far as standing is concerned 
 yeah it logically gives rise to taxpayer standing so and i think there is 
 what is your answer to that that in fact its bad in the first situation and okay in the second as far as standing is concerned 
 what i would say is in either case its bad i would say that there is taxpayer standing to challenge the disbursement of funds outside the government but not your horrible hypothetical about an internal government church 
 there is no standing for the internal government church 
 not taxpayer standing anybody whos subjected to the mass at the church probably has standing as a matter of direct 
 no we are not forcing anybody in at gunpoint we are just building a government church 
 with respect justice scalia nobody forced van orden to walk by the ten commandments display in texas at gunpoint and yet this court said that he could bring an establishment clause challenge so i think there would be directly injured people who could challenge your sort of end of the slippery slope 
 but we are talking taxpayer standing and you think there is a real difference insofar as whether the taxpayer is harmed between the congress saying we are going to give the money to a religious organization to build a church and congress saying we are going to build a church you really think theres a difference 
 i think theres a difference in the extent to which there is a conceptually direct injury for the taxpayer as taxpayer the citizens are clearly injured when the government sets up the church 
 in both cases money is being used for a purpose that is contrary to the establishment clause according to the taxpayer 
 but with respect in the context of the internal government church the fact that money is being spent to establish that church is the 
 taxpayer money 
 least of your concerns its the fact that the government is establishing it thats the principal concern 
 i dont care whether its the least of the concerns its a concern its the same establishment clause concern in both cases now you may well be correct that theres a freedom of religion clause violation in one case and not in the other but as far as the establishment clause violation i find it difficult to understand the difference between the two 
 well justice scalia i think its a difference suggested by this courts cases and they do make an important distinction between the distribution of money outside the government where the spending itself is the injury and what this court has termed the incidental expenditure of money in the context of an executive branch activity that itself is alleged to violate the establishment clause 
 and why should that make any difference if the entire theory behind it is sort of a madisonian theory if not threepence from the pocket for a religious purpose if you start with the madisonian view there should be no distinction of the two cases that justice scalia puts 
 im not quite sure thats right justice souter because i think that theres really two ways the government can establish religion one is they can do it themselves directly and if they do that i think that the primary problem is the primary executive branch conduct in doing so the other way they can establish 
 no but lets talk about establishing maybe this is what you are going to do establishing religion by spending the threepence 
 exactly and that is precisely what 
 and in this case when you build the church you are spending the threepence whether whether a a government employee is laying the bricks or a contract an outside contractor is laying the bricks or a third party institution to which a grant has been made is laying the bricks its the same threepence 
 with respect in the one respect it is the three pence itself that is the establishment violation it is the act of handing government money into the coffers 
 taking the money out of the pocket and using it for a particular purpose and the money comes out of the pocket in each case the purpose is the same in each case 
 again i would take issue with that and say the primary concern that madison was focused on was the taking of the money and then giving it to the outside religious entity 
 would you have covered the case where the government itself the executive is the actor and said thats not covered by flast but it is covered what is covered is if the give the money directly to the religious organization if the money goes instead of to the government take this case if the conferences are run by a private contractor contractor with the executive where would that fall 
 i think it might depend on the nature of the claim actually if the nature of the claim 
 this claim these conferences are run now instead of within the executive branch by various agencies they are run by contractors specialists in conferences that have been engaged by the executive to help people make grant applications 
 but i think the better view is the challenge is exactly this one which is not that theres something wrong with the recipient but that theres something wrong with what goes on at these conferences then in that context i dont think there would be standing 
 thats thats a question on the merits right now we have to take the allegations of the complaint on the merits as the allegation is i take it that religious organizations are being favored over secular organizations but thats a merits question you have you have you have been clear that if the government itself spends the money then theres no standing you have you have been clear that if it gives the money to the religious group there is standing now money is going outside the government going outside the government but is not going to the religious organization where do you fit that 
 again i think if i understand the question i would say that theres no taxpayer standing there and i think but but and i apologize for sort of bleeding over into the merits but with all due respect i dont think you can really meaningfully talk about the flast nexus test without bleeding over a little bit into the merits because the court did it itself in flast and what i would say is if you have a challenge where the problem is that its the very act of money going to the third party conference organizers thats the problem then it really is a spending case and i think the taxpayer standing would logically lie but if its really what the concern here is the primary conduct of what was done at the conferences and not the fact that theres spending on the conferences at all then i think its more it is a case there would not be taxpayer standing 
 there wouldnt be tax taxpayer standing but of course there would be regular article iii standing in the sense that in a party claiming to be injured because they didnt get a grant and a religious organization did and the reason was religion can bring any kind of claim they want under article iii its just they wouldnt qualify for the special exception to the general rule that there is no taxpayer standing for establishment clause cases 
 thats exactly right and its a very important point because for example when this court recognized that the bible reading in doremus did not give rise to taxpayer standing that didnt stop the parents who were directly injured by the same practice in shemp from bringing an establishment clause 
 just one one more question on this on this line and i wont belabor the hypothetical again theres a federal statute for this conference and the moneys go for air tickets to various religious ministers and priests does that meet your outside the government test for standing 
 i think there would be taxpayer standing if i understand that and i realize that you know one could say well thats is a fairly artificial distinction but i do think that it is suggested by this courts precedents and the reason that it makes sense is that when you have injury where the real injury is the spending the fact that you are not supposed to pay for plane tickets for ministers thats an establishment clause injury then it makes sense to say that people that provided that money in the in the first place have a distinct injury 
 but not but not if the president just gives the money out of a general appropriation authorizing him to give money to people who are helping in the programs that the faithbased initiative was was designed to help 
 well 
 if the president hands over the money thats okay 
 not necessarily justice scalia but its important to focus on what this case is about 
 why why not necessarily i thought that was your you proposition that it has to be a congressional violation not an executive 
 right and it would depend a little bit on about where the president is getting the money i think the way that we would look at it 
 hes getting the money from congress under a general under a general appropriation if he takes this money and he says here use it for a religious purpose thats okay 
 he 
 as far as standing is concerned he cant be sued 
 if he if hes taking it from a general appropriation that makes no indication its to go outside the government so one could not in any way articulate that as an asapplied challenge to the appropriations then i suppose that there would not be standing but i think 
 i dont understand im back i really im surprised and its probably my fault but that i thought i started where justice scalia was with his first question i thought this had something to do with whether congress passed a statute or the president acted on his own but listening to you now i think i cant decide i think you have a different argument suppose im just trying to understand suppose that congress passes a law and it says its a very nice thing to commemorate the pilgrims by building a government church at plymouth rock where we will have the regular worship in the puritan religion now can a taxpayer from california in your view challenge that 
 i would say that thats a much harder case than this 
 yes but 
 but i say no i would say no no 
 why not because i thought flast made clear that they could 
 no what flast makes clear is that you can challenge a congressional statute that is a taxing and spending statute and i think to understand the circumstances in which you should give rise to taxpayer standing you need two things you need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority but then you need the money to go outside the government and thats precisely what 
 then you go to a private group 
 right because theres again theres two ways 
 so you are saying that if the government has the most amazing lets im trying to think of something more amazing that what i just thought of 
 all over america they build churches dedicated to one religion and congress passes a statute and says in every city town and hamlet we are going to have a minister a government minister a government church and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect and they pass a statute like that nobody could challenge it 
 horrible hypothetical 
 is that what you are saying then 
 i mean i think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing plenty of people could probably challenge that 
 i dont know i mean 
 probably 
 everybody else who doesnt want to go just avoids it so that they dont have to do anything they just have to 
 any presumably any other denomination that is not of the established church could bring a challenge that they are being discriminated against because they are favoring a particular church over them your proposition is simply that somebody somebody in oregon cant challenge the fact that they are building a church in florida simply because the person in florida pays taxes right 
 exactly and not just the person in oregon but everybody in between oregon and florida all have the same amount of standing no what we are saying is plenty of people would be able to challenge that but not 
 who who 
 as as the chief justice suggested i think anybody from a different denomination that said that this was discriminatory probably could bring a claim i also think that anybody who walked into one of those churches could bring a claim and again this court this court 
 maybe they dont walk into it because it is not our church so they dont walk into it 
 well we 
 and moreover they dont they dont feel its discriminatory its just we are doing this to commemorate the pilgrims and we will give the money to any group thats a pilgrim 
 with respect with respect justice breyer i think you are underestimating the ingenuity of plaintiffs to think that somebody that walked by going to plymouth rock okay thinking i was going to see a nice historical exhibit and is and to see a church wouldnt bring a an action and that there wouldnt be article iii standing for that particular individual not the taxpayer 
 general clement are you are arguing that these lines that you are drawing make a lot of sense in an abstract sense or are you just arguing that this is the best that can be done that this is the best that can be done within the body of precedent that the court has handed down in this area 
 the latter justice alito 
 and i appreciate i appreciate the question 
 why didnt you say so 
 i i have been trying to make sense out of what you are saying 
 well and i have been trying to make sense out of this courts precedents 
 and the best that i can do the best that i can do when i put together flast 
 do we think have a duty to follow precedents that dont make any sense 
 well i think as a matter of first course the court tries and here if i could put the precedents on the map though i do think they make a modicum of sense in the following way you start with flast flast says that you can bring a challenge to a congressional spending statute okay fair enough valley forge comes along and says that you that you dont have taxpayer standing to challenge an executive branch action now that raises a very obvious 
 the difference was that it was because it was under the property clause and made a distinction between property and money 
 well justice 
 we are talking about money not property 
 but justice ginsburg in fairness the court could not have been more clear in valley forge that there were two reasons that there werent taxpayer standing there one was there was a challenge to executive branch action the second was that it was the property clause rather than the spending clause now you could sort of take the view that the third of the cases kendrick overrules the first aspect of the decision in valley forge now i think thats wrong i think the way to understand kendrick is as follows you have a decision that says you can you can challenge congressional spending not executive branch action that naturally poses the question what about an asapplied challenge to a spending statute surely i mean because spending is something only the congress does and disbursement is a ministerial act that only the executive does what do you do when theres an intervening ministerial act of disbursement does that mean that its still an asapplied challenge to the spending statute or does 
 was it just 
 that mean that its executive branch action 
 was it just a ministerial act or did the executive have discretion involved about who would receive the grant 
 well justice ginsburg two things one in bowen there was there is certainly always a degree of discretion but it is worth noting that in bowen as in flast the statute itself on its face made clear that money was to go to outside entities that were religious in bowen it did so in express terms by four times referring to religious organizations in flast it did so by saying money was going to go or inkind aid rather was to going to go to private schools and that was at a time when this court roughly contemporaneously in lemon v kurtzman that N percent of the private schools were religious the both of those the gravamen of whats the complaint that money is being spent by congress on religious entities was not within the discretion of the executive branch and again the way i would understand kendrick is simply reconciling valley forge and flast and cohen to preserve not broad challenges to executive branch action which would have overruled valley forge but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can bring an asapplied challenge to a spending statute 
 but you can reconcile valley forge simply by saying when its money from the federal treasury whether it is a general appropriation or a specific appropriation it is money from the treasury and thats what flast is about because whether it is spent by the executive under an executive program which you have said can violate the establishment clause as well as a congressional program so why isnt that the line to draw based on flast that its money from the treasury that makes the difference 
 well justice ginsburg it is certainly not the line i would draw from reading these cases side by side and together 
 or to or to put it another way to put justice ginsburgs point another way every executive action that involves the expenditure of congressionally authorized funds is an asapplied challenge to an expenditure statute because the only way the statute is applied is through executive action and whenever the executive spends the funds improperly you have an asapplied challenge to the congressional statute authorizing the funds whether its a general statute or a or a single shot statute 
 justice scalia i would have said that no one would have conceptualized that as an asapplied challenge to a general appropriation statute i mean i guess you would but i 
 its a 
 even even if you would do that in another case i dont see how you could do it in this case if you look at their complaint they dont identify a single appropriation statute that they take issue with even before the tenth the seventh circuit if you look at page N a of the petitioners appendix 
 thats the essence of an asapplied challenge you say the statutes okay it is just what is being done under this statute that is bad you dont have to identify a bad statute you are saying it is a perfectly good statute but the president is is violating the constitution in the way that hes applying it 
 with respect justice scalia i have never heard of an asapplied challenge to a statute that doesnt identity thats unconstitutional as applied and its your right 
 under that under that approach when a us marshal executes a search and theres a fourth amendment claim that the search is illegal thats really a challenge to the appropriation of the marshals service on an asapplied basis 
 thats exactly right mr chief justice and every constitutional right could be sort of transmogrified into a claim that oh thats an asapplied appropriations challenge because the governments not supposed to spend money to do unlawful things 
 so whats wrong with just saying that flast stands for the proposition that when the government spends money in violation of the establishment clause a taxpayer after all the money comes from the taxpayer can bring a lawsuit and the reason that they do that is because the establishment clause is an important joint part of the religion clauses and thered be no other way to bring such a challenge and sometimes its that simple principle and when we depart from that principle say by giving property away instead of giving money away you dont have the standing so we have a pretty clear simple rule that rule applies whether its congress or the president acting under congressional authority et cetera which i think is close to what the other side 
 can i just add this thought before you answer and isnt that exactly what justice stewart said in his concurring opinion 
 absolutely i mean if this court wants to go the route of justice stewart which it pointedly rejected the majority of the court pointed rejected in flast and say establishment clause challenges we are going to relax the normal article iii standard now im not quite sure where the court gets the authority to relax the normal article iii standards but assuming that that would at least be 
 because there is a real case or controversy because people become terribly upset when they see some other religion getting the money from the state for the for building a church for example and thats why theres a real controversy 
 getting upset is a constitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit if people get upset about spending money for purposes that the federal government is not allowed to spend money for because of states rights that also would justify article iii standing wouldnt it 
 i suppose under that theory and obviously the plaintiffs in richardson and schlesinger were very upset as well and the court said that 
 it is the kind of upset that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of genuine injury is not the case when you look to objectives of various other clauses of the constitution 
 justice breyer let me try to answer in two ways if i can one is to say that that way of looking at it takes you even beyond where justice brennan was in valley forge even justice brennan would have drawn the line at what he called bestowals of government largesse to third parties 
 thats what i was saying i said that flast then encapsulates that principle drawn out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a rule and the rule is what i suggested 
 well again but he 
 based on money 
 but again he didnt say just spending of money to do the executive branchs everyday operations and maybe and one day they go a little too far in praising religion he said bestowal of government largesse outside the government the second point i would make is i still dont understand where in just being upset you satisfy the irreducible minimum requirements of article iii and even though flast is probably the outer limit of whats an article iii injury under normal principles there is at least what judge leventhal in public citizen against simon called conceptual directness between the injury to the taxpayer and the injury that comes when tax money is spent outside the government to a religious entity he differentiated that from what happens when you have general executive branch activity thats unlawful where he said theres no similar arrow between the action and taxpayers as a class its a classic injury thats inflicted on everybody its a generalized grievance which has never been said to satisfy article iii 
 you are talking about an incidental expenditure as part of a regulatory program is quite different from looking at a discrete program the faithbased initiative is a discrete program and one component of it is this set of conferences this is not an incidental something pursuant to a large regulatory program faithbased initiative is the name of this program 
 but justice ginsburg their challenge is not that the money thats spent on conferences cant be spent on conferences their challenge is that what happened at the conference is there was too much promotion of religion the fact that the money was spent on the conferences is incidental to the gravamen of the complaint if i may save my time for rebuttal 
 thank you general clement mr pincus 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the governments argument here is that flast needs major surgery and as the discussion i think in the first part of the argument shows its proposing two very substantial limitations that bear no relation to the relevant establishment clause principles the history of the clause or the history of this courts decisions and we think theres no basis for drawing the arbitrary lines that the government suggests and maybe i can follow up on some of the points that my colleague made and that the court made during the questioning first of all with respect to the argument that the money has to go outside the government theres certainly nothing in this courts cases that say that and the lower courts and this court at least in part have found taxpayer standing to challenge the salaries paid to chaplains that are employed by the government and of course those would be 
 well thats i guess thats my first question i dont understand under your theory why any taxpayer couldnt sue our marshal for standing up and saying god save the united states and this honorable court her salary comes from congress you can trace that under your traceability requirement so any taxpayer under your theory could bring that lawsuit 
 well i dont i dont think that lawsuit could be brought mr chief justice and let me explain why we think that the limitations that are in this courts opinions require the taxpayer to identify a discrete and identifiable nonincidental expenditure in other words its not just any 
 its very i can identify it its the appropriations that congress extends to this court that pay the salary of the marshal 
 but your honor those appropriations dont do the trick and maybe i can just explain our test and explain why the court in doremus explained why there was standing in everson to challenge the payments for bus transportation by saying everson showed a measurable appropriation or disbursement of school district funds occasioned solely by the activities complained of in other words there has to be some the violation caused some unique expenditure not that the moneys wouldnt have been expended because in this context the taxpayer doesnt have to show a lower tax burden but 
 well mr pincus 
 that there was a tie between im sorry 
 there have been federal spending programs declared unconstitutional under the establishment clause and can you cite any instance in which such a holding ing has caused a reduction in tax rates 
 no and this court has said and the lower courts have said that that is not the requirement because the injury here that the taxpayer complains of as the court said in daimler chrysler is not an increased tax burden the injury is the expenditure of funds in a way that violates the establishment clause 
 see your traceability either covers every case or it covers no case in real world taxation terms no case would ever meet the test but in in purely conceptual terms is any federal money being spent every case involving any expenditure of money even the portion of the marshals salary that is devoted to convening the court in the morning would be sufficient 
 well respectfully your honor thats not what the court said in doremus in describing everson it didnt say the mere fact that some money being spent was enough it said that there was a measurable appropriation or disbursement occasioned solely by the activities complained of 
 let me give you something more measurable it is easy to tell from time sheets and other things how much money is expended on air force one and on security for the president when he goes to address a religious organization okay and he urges the importance of religion in american life and so forth the whole trip is about religion thats measurable would a taxpayer have standing to 
 i dont think so because as the court of appeals said that this court has identified a second limitation which is not incidental the money has to be central the money thats being challenged has to be central to the violation just as you couldnt challenge a prayer breakfast 
 well i dont understand the money say it again 
 the money has to be central to the violation 
 you mean congress has to has to say that 
 no it can be in this case for example the challenge is that these conferences were the entire conference program was a program to further religion over nonreligion 
 well what about bowen the money wasnt central to the violation there 
 im sorry justice scalia 
 it was you know a pregnancy program and the executive added to it certain certain restrictions that were challenged as being religiously based 
 but the 
 and we allowed an asapplied challenge 
 you did an asreplied challenge to the specific grants but there were specific grants identified and there was an asapplied challenge but the argument was 
 but this is a specific grant there is money allocated to the white house which goes you can identify it in the budget and some of it goes to air force one some of it goes to the payment of the security guards 
 yes your honor but the money thats identified in the budget is not well its not the entire air force one appropriation that would be challenged in the kind of claim you are talking about 
 it wasnt in bowen either 
 but it was a specific there was a specific action that allocated a specific amount of money to those grantees and the argument was those grantees werent entitled to any of that money because the way they were using it violated the establishment clause and so there was the governments own action by designating a specific sum of money in that grant identified a specific sum of money and the challenge was to that entire expenditure as identified by the government 
 i really dont think theres an identified sum of money that goes to pay the costs of air force one too to buy the gas and everything else theres an identified sum of money that goes into the pockets of the security guards who protect the president i mean it really doesnt make any sense 
 well your honor i think i think as i say there are two tests one is whether theres an identifiable sum we were talking about with respect to grants are the easiest case theres another case as when theres a challenge to an entire program that the government has identified as a particular program and then the question the second question that the court has identified in flast was is it incidental or not is it something that is peripheral 
 take justice breyers pilgrim church under your theory if the grant was to erect a memorial and suitable museums or whatever at plymouth plymouth rock then there wouldnt be an identifiable sum if the government said hey lets use some of this money to build a church 
 if the government then singled out some of that money 
 the government singles it out by that you mean the executive whos implementing it as opposed to congress 
 yes i think 
 how do they in other words if they spend the money are they singling it out if it turns out it costs a million dollars to build the little pilgrim church is that an identifiable sum singled out that would satisfy your requirement 
 well i dont think the singling out i dont think whether its discrete and identifiable depends on the amount your honor i think it depends on how whether there is a way and this really is part of both traceability and redressability there has to be a way to identify the expenditure that the taxpayer is seeking to enjoin and if there is some separate government grant for the building of a church yes if its if if there is some religious 
 well it doesnt have to be a grant just that you can say it costs so much money 
 or a contract 
 yes 
 if the government let the contract for the building of the church yes 
 or the contract hiring the security guards who protect the president right they are employed thats an employment contract 
 well they are and that 
 and they are protecting him for a religious purpose hes going to this 
 well they are protecting him for a protection purpose his trip is for a religious purpose and i think our submission is that there is a distinction that can be drawn there 
 this is money that is expended in order to enable the president to do something for a religious purpose it wouldnt be expended but for the fact that he chose to make this religious trip 
 but but as with buying the bagels at a prayer breakfast the cost of the bagels like the cost of the security is not is not paying for the center of what the violation is and therefore we think that thats the basis for a rule that rules those types of expenditures out 
 it wasnt it wasnt the center in bowen either the center in bowen was programs for to combat pregnancy and some of the organizations that were getting the money were placing conditions on it it wasnt central to the program it was something added that the challenger said shouldnt have been added 
 but their claim was that the spending of this entire grant is unconstitutional because of the way the money is going to be used by the grantees it wasnt that $N of the is unconstitutional and the other million dollars is okay it was that because of the way the grantee was using the money the entire grant is unconstitutional we think thats a different case 
 i see it would only came within your theory if there was one secret service agent who was assigned to religious trips of the president then his entire salary could be challenged but if its just some of the salary of a secret service agent who protects the president for all sorts of trips that cant be challenged 
 yes and we think 
 and that makes a lot of sense 
 well it does make sense because unlike the governments limitations which have nothing to do with the rationale of flast or the underlying threepence here of james madison that does that is a particular amount of money that the government is spending and its identifiable just because of religion we think that thats 
 so if we rule in your favor then every government agency has to make sure that whatever activities they undertake are part of a broader office they dont set up a separate white house office they just run it out of the white house office 
 well they may 
 its purely a purely formalistic distinction 
 well i dont think so your honor because i think it preserves 
 well that would decide whether its central or not if you have a white house office of faithbased and community initiatives then you can say its central to it if its just the white house office then the argument would be no thats not central they do a lot of other stuff as went 
 well but if there are 
 but the marshall in both 
 if there are particular people in that office for a particular separately called out program in that office that is focused on faithbased initiatives only yes 
 we are trying to decide whether it is central you have to decide what unit you are looking at before deciding whether the activity is central and you are just saying well just look at the people who are doing the offensive activity and its obviously going to be central to what they are doing 
 your honor i think i havent been clear in the test that im suggesting 
 mr pincus i would like you to go back to an answer you gave because it sounds to me like it wasnt right the president needs protection at all times no matter where he goes the president may be doing something that violates the establishment clause but protection is the job and it doesnt make any difference where the president is and so your answer to the question well suppose he had a special protector who just took care of his religious activities i would still say that its protection is the thing so i dont think i think you didnt the answer you gave isnt consistent with your theory of this case 
 well i think thats right and i think thats because there are two steps to our analysis justice ginsburg one is is there a discrete and identifiable expenditure that only arises with respect to religious activities the second question is does that particular expenditure is that particular expenditure an incidental one flast said incidental expenditures dont give rise to standing and i think you are right in that situation that expenditure 
 but in response to justice ginsburgs point you could have said the same thing about the expenditure in bowen that money would have been spent anyway 
 but the question 
 it happened to have been spent badly but it would have been spent anyway 
 but it would have been spent differently your honor and i think thats the critical 
 that was her point that it would have been spent differently if the president hadnt gone to this religious event he would have gone somewhere else and the money would have been spent differently but that didnt make the difference in bowen why should it make the difference here 
 well i think 
 the fact is it was spent for a bad purpose and thats the essential grievance of the plaintiff it seems to me 
 we agree completely but we also agree that there are some limits that the court has said that every single dollar thats expended for a bad purpose doesnt give rise to a challenge my example if theres a prayer breakfast and all the only money thats spent is on the bagels we dont believe the bagels are the basis for a taxpayer challenge to the prayer breakfast 
 so in fact you have just help me with one point here i mean i see that deciding whats incidental and what isnt incidental will be difficult i guess many of these cases would end up being decided on the merits there is no violation on the merits or maybe sometimes there is but id started thinking of the question of standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when the government spends money in favor of one religion and not another after all they led to the N years war we see that in other places in the world today people feel strongly and if in fact they have that terribly strong feeling and cant make any challenge because the feelings are shared by many then there are no cases in the courts at all and the government can do what it wants without challenge so in flast they carved out an exception and the exception was where the taxing and spending clauses were involved because madison and others said this is aimed at government shall not tax and spend so that was my theory and all we are saying is where theres a big taxing and spending and it isnt incidental theres standing now we are worried about the merits simple and clear to which the response was which has me a little worried frankly was that well that was justice stewarts position or roughly speaking but the court rejected that quite clearly and if you look at later cases they reject it too and therefore whatever you might think of it it isnt the law and im not free to think whatever i have to think exactly in accordance with what the cases say so what is your response id like you to focus on that 
 well respectfully i think thats exactly what justice stewart said justice stewart in his concurrence did not espouse a broader theory than the one that the court adopted in flast and he said he joined the judgment the opinion of the court and he said i understand that to hold only that a federal taxpayer has standing to assert that a specific expenditure of federal funds violates the establishment clause of the first amendment 
 so you are saying that what justice stewarts view insofar as it was rejected that flast suggested even broader standing but it suggested at least what justice stewart said 
 yes i think its 
 is that right or not 
 yes 
 if justice stewart agreed completely with what the court said why did he write a separate opinion 
 well in the sometimes despite the courts desire sometimes to have a less separate opinion sometimes justices do and what he said here is he was just explaining his reason why he believed that flast was distinguishable from frothingham and notes specifically that taxpayers have a clear stake because of the threepence comment justice fortas did say did have a broader theory although he in addition that the court did not adopt but he also said recognizing very similar language to justice stewart what the courts opinion held so i think justice stewarts opinion is useful because he doesnt talk about congress he talks about expenditures 
 it seems to me unduly intrusive for the courts to tell the president that it cannot talk to specific groups to see if they have certain talents that the government may use to make sure that all of their energies are used properly by the federal government its almost like a speech rationale and perhaps you would say thats just a judgment on the merits but it seems to me that theres a standing concern here too that we would be supervising the white house and what it can say what it can who it can talk to and it seems to me thats quite intrusive from the standpoint of standing purposes im not sure that this makes a standard that distinguishes the case from flast or brings it within those within those cases 
 well your honor we believe that the incidental test and what i have been talking about in terms of what the limits are that it has to be a nonincidental expenditure protects against that because if the argument is that some government official for part of his day met with three ministers and therefore we want to challenge because government shouldnt be meeting with ministers i think its both for the reason both because of the fact this is not an argument that the expenditure on the hours of the day it took to have those meetings is clearly not central to anything 
 you really want to condemn the federal courts to deciding case by case at the instance of all these people who feel passionately about this case by case whether the expenditure was incidental or not it doesnt seem to me an intelligent expenditure of any sensible persons time 
 well 
 and just to add to the question before you answer at the jurisdictional stage in other words this would be litigation over whether the individual taxpayer has standing the court would first have to determine whether the activity you are challenging is incidental or not 
 well your honor i think the fact that there hasnt been a lot of these challenges that the government has been able to point to indicates that this may not be a big problem 
 maybe they are reading flast different than you read it there are not a lot of these challenges because you dont have standing under flast 
 but the court also said in allen against wright you know the absence of precise standards does not leave the courts at sea in applying the law of standing standing isnt an area really that is susceptible to precise definitions it seems to me that both because of the incidental test and the concerns that justice kennedy articulated if someones claim is that people in the white house have five meets in the course of a year that they are upset about it does not take much at the jurisdictional 
 well what would happen if 
 even if its true even if its true 
 well then five meetings isnt enough how many 
 what about N 
 N 
 i was about to ask N 
 well your honor our position 
 we will litigate it we will figure out a number eventually im sure 
 well you know in allen against wright and linda rf there are a whole series of cases where this court has set up guidance and the lower courts have evaluated whether the connection between the challenged conduct and the claimed injury here the expenditure is close enough for there to be standing and this the inquiry that we are suggesting really isnt that different 
 what would happen if when this program was set up nothing said about faith whatsoever this was just going to be a general program of outreach to community service organizations but plaintiffs claimed that as the program was being administered it was heavily favoring religious organizations would that come out the same way in your judgment 
 if their challenge was that the entire the whole program essentially as the court of appeals characterized the complaint here the whole program essentially is facially neutral but in reality is a preference yes then it would come out the same way and the question would be 
 it depends totally on how they characterize 
 well thats true in many standing questions the question is how do you characterize the claim 
 but the problem here is the claim the gravamen here is the government is doing stuff with money thats been taxed from me that it shouldnt do i fail to see how it makes any difference to the people who care so passionately about this as justice breyer suggests whether its just an incidental expenditure or whether its part of a targeted program we dont do that in any other area of constitutional law if someone has been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure we dont say well you know it was just incidental yeah we know you feel badly about it but this was just an incidental search and seizure and you dont have standing it doesnt make any sense given the gravamen that you are directing this law against to establish such a standard 
 well your honor it is a standard that the court established in flast it is 
 and you also acknowledge we are not here to try to make sense 
 no i actually think the courts precedents line up pretty neatly i think 
 but not neatly i mean in terms of the purposes of the thing are your clients claiming that it would violate the establishment clause for the president to go to lots and lots of prayer breakfasts 
 no 
 no i never met anyone who did but i guess there is a legitimate concern somebody might think that i guess and i guess that if people there is some tendency of the people that are worried you know there are pro ses there are all kinds of people somebody could claim that so you want a way to keep them out 
 you want a way to keep them out 
 its justice kennedys concern 
 exactly and 
 but what they are worried about is will this word incidental and be sufficient to keep out the people who might somehow decide they want to claim which sounds like a frivolous claim that the president cant go to a prayer breakfast now does the word incidental do that thats what i think 
 well our submission is that it does your honor because we think 
 again i asked this before and i think you were cut off before you had a chance incidental with respect to what all of the money for a particular meeting a particular breakfast a particular whatever is it incidental to that or is it incidental to however many times the president has breakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast 
 its incidental to what whats the focus of the claim the focus of the claim isnt that bagels were served the focus of the claim is there was prayer and that it was a religious meeting if there was just to think of what such a claim might be and so the expenditure that thats been identified is the bagels it really is pretty tangential compared to the focus of what someones complaining about and so we think thats a rational test for doing what justice kennedy was talking about 
 so even if the expenditure is very small but to take a particular religious symbol that might be offensive to some other people is that incidental because the meeting went on longer and cost more than the particular religious symbol 
 no i think there probably there would be two challenges because there would be a challenge to the governments purchase of the religious symbol to have at the meeting in addition to the meeting and i think then 
 so if it was N dollars you would say its not incidental because it covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious symbol 
 yes but i dont think this and i think the government agrees with this i dont think this is a test about how much i think this is a test about the relationship between the expenditure thats challenged and the claim whats alleged to be unlawful this complex of government activity 
 so theres no standing to challenge a presidential directive which says we are going to buy bagels for all evangelistic christian breakfasts 
 okay but not for any 
 no i think there would be standing 
 why would there be standing 
 because there the challenge is to the discriminatory purchase its not about the prayer breakfast its about the idea that the government is purchasing bagels in a religiously discriminatory way 
 of course but the point is that makes 
 so there absolutely would be standing 
 but that shows how totally manipulable your incidental test is you just have to phrase your claim so that it covers whatever expenditure 
 but your honor 
 is offending you its not incidental doesnt protect you from frivolous or insignificant claims in any way 
 your honor i think it does because there would have to be an allegation in that situation that bagels were being purchased on a religious basis and thats going to be awfully hard for a lawyer to sign in good faith i think the problem if i may 
 how does that confer standing how does that confer standing 
 the purchase the idea that bagels are being purchased only for evangelicals and not for jewish breakfasts 
 right right 
 because the government 
 standing by joe doaks not from somebody whos starting a jewish prayer breakfast and says you know what could be worse than not buying bagels for a jewish prayer breakfast with him i could understand he has standing but im just talking about one of these many people who feel passionately about this just in general you walk in and say he cant do this because im a taxpayer and you say im sorry being a taxpayer is not enough we dont care how passionately you feel about it 
 i dont think general passion is enough i think what the court said is there has to be a tiein and let me say that i think whats critical here is any test obviously is susceptible to hypotheticals but the government our test at least keeps in taxpayer standing the core of what the framers were worried about which is government expenditure of funds 
 mr pincus may i ask you this question do you think your theory is consistent with valley forge 
 yes your honor we do because in valley forge first of all as justice ginsburg said the court relied on the fact that it was a property clause claim there is a passage in valley forge that refers to executive action but the court in kendrick when it talked about valley forge said in characterizing that case said executive action pursuant to the property clause and we think those things are tied together and theres a reason why in the appropriations context there always is congressional action with respect to the very money thats at issue because there has to be a congressional appropriation thats not true in the property context congress doesnt have to say pass a statute to say here are the N property sites that we want the executive to get rid of 
 do you think the distinction between taxing between taxing and spending and the property clause makes any sense do you think james madison would not be upset if the commonwealth of virginia transferred N acres to the anglican church that would be okay but the threepence in taxation would not 
 well i think that the core of what was the concern was was the taking of the money and the using it for religious purposes and i think what the 
 well its not the same money used its not the same property 
 no its not the same money 
 it goes into some pot of fungible money and its other money used so instead of using other money you use land does that make a difference 
 well i think that the court decided that it made a difference and i think in terms of cabining in terms of the worry that perhaps flast is going to be overbroad and the need to have congress involved which i think is key there was no congressional involvement at all in designating those properties and there is in the appropriations context and i think thats a key difference but i think whats important here and the courts colloquy in the first part of the argument showed me this but the governments position the idea that its only grants to third parties the government could hire a corps of chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the populace at large and that couldnt be challenged because all it is is executive pay and the idea that theres some difference between a bowen v kendrick situation where the executive had tremendous discretion in terms of where it was going to give the money and the situation here which is the exercise of precisely the same executive discretion makes no sense the injury is the same the conduct thats thats the core of the violation is the same its an executive branch decision to use funds in a way thats impermissible under the establishment clause and we have been drawing the lines that the government has been trying to draw just makes no sense and to leave out to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge swaths of conduct that is really at the very core of what madison was concerned about so our submission is that that really makes no sense theres no basis in history for example for the governments claim that executive branch decisions are somehow different and insulated with respect to spending its the spending of the same threepence and if history indicates anything its that concerns about establishment were focused just as much on the king as on the parliament in terms of the history that the framers understood and for the idea that the executive would be given free rein to exercise discretion with respect to spending and there would be no concern about the types of injuries that gave rise to flast we think is just not right if the court has no further questions thank you 
 thank you mr pincus general clement you have three minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice just a few points in rebuttal first of all i think its important to emphasize that if this court recognizes that there is not taxpayer standing that does not mean that there wont be lawsuits that there wont be directly injured plaintiffs that can bring claims doremus and schemp prove that point but even more broadly any time the establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced are going to have standing to bring the suit the second point to make clear is its just not an accurate description of this courts cases to say that the spending of appropriated funds by the executive is enough to give rise to taxpayer standing the property distribution plan at issue in valley forge took a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing the bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the teachers in doremus presumably cost at least a threepence but that was not found enough now i think in trying to understand the courts cases you really have to focus on this word incidental and i think that the colloquy in the second half of the argument shows that you cant look at incidental as being minimal it doesnt mean that it doesnt mean minimal it doesnt mean incremental it is trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of funds when as to something where the expenditure of funds is central or vital to the establishment clause violation in the context of money going to third party religious entities nobody would say that the spending is incidental its the whole violation in the context of bible reading or anything else the executive branch does the fact that money went to fund the executive branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems the problem is the primary conduct of the executive branch in violating the establishment clause but thats not a spending injury the funding that goes into that is incidental i think thats the way to make sense of this courts cases its important to emphasize whats at issue here its not a general challenge to the faithbased office its not a challenge to the name of the office it is a challenge to the particular offices and the assertion that the executive branch officials at the conferences spent too much time talking about faithbased groups and not enough talking about communitybased groups if that isnt intrusive on the executive branch i dont know what is the last point i would leave you with is that if something has to go in this area if you have to choose between the logic of flast and the irreducible minimum requirements of article iii i think its an easy choice you dont abandon the basic requirements of article iii that distinguish the judiciary from the political branches of government i think the seventh circuit with all due respect lost sight of that its decision should be reversed thank you 
 thank you general the case is submitted 
 we will hear argument next in case N wilkie versus robinson general garre 
 thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court respondent asks this court to recognize a new constitutional tort under bivens and the just compensation clause 
 mr garre could you crank up the thing the sound isnt working i dont think mr garre 
 i think it needs a little upcranking good 
 hopefully thats better recognize a new constitutional tort under bivens and the just compensation clause that would subject public officials to personal liability for conduct that he concedes does not amount to a taking recognizing that constitutional tort would require this court to extend bivens to an entirely new context it would disregard limits that have existed for centuries on just compensation clause claims and it would skew the enforcement of important public land use objectives and thereby threaten public resources and public lands 
 general garre theres a record here that the district court said there was substantial evidence enough to go to trial of a pattern of harassing conduct that included trespasses on this mans lodge and leaving the place in disarray videotaping the guests selective enforcement of the grazing laws a whole pattern of things even asking the bureau of indian affairs to impound his cattle this man says this has been done to me by officers of my government is there a remedy 
 justice ginsburg there are a number of avenues that he could have sought to prevent this alleged conduct and that he did invoke we dont think that there is a remedy under bivens or an inferred action under the just compensation clause 
 well what is what is there that will really be effective because if you tell me challenging each citation for violating the grazing permit 
 he can challenge the citations for challenging the canceling the grazing permits 
 and then the behavior will continue and he will get one more and one more and one more 
 well i dont think that thats a reasonable inference justice ginsburg in fact the ibla considered and rejected each of the alleged administrative actions on which his claim is now based 
 may i ask a quick question i had the same list of alleged acts and i think many of them are uncontested that justice ginsburg mentioned just as a matter of policy can you inform me when the solicitor generals office takes this case do you look into whether any of these things happen and the justice department issues a warning dont do this any more if these things are as justice ginsburg explained you dont defend all of those actions 
 well our position is that he hasnt established a constitutional tort or an actionable claim under rico 
 i know that i know that 
 to answer your question the government takes these types of allegations seriously its taken seriously at the line level at the bureau of land management its taken seriously within the department of interior and its taken seriously at the department of justice 
 because if this if this continues your argument and i understand your argument that theres no essential freestanding cause of action for damages basically means he has a right to go broke with attorneys fees challenging each individual incursion each individual wrong well again that assumes that he wouldnt get any relief out of the ibla that assumes that if he had gone to the ibla and said you canceled my grazing permits for grounds that werent valid that the blm would have proceeded to engage in the same conduct in fact the ibla 
 well thats exactly what he alleged and he said and it happened for over a fiveyear period 
 but we know from the decisions of the ibla that he did challenge that they rejected the grounds that he 
 they may be wrong too they may have been as much a part of the conspiracy as the officers who conducted it and there are indeed those in the west who think that the blm does does act quite arbitrarily and highhandedly and is is upheld by by the the administrative courts now if thats a problem whats the solution to that problem 
 well justice scalia to bring an apa action to federal court challenging the final decisions of the ibla 
 thats one by one every time there is another trespass he has to go all the way through the administrative procedure and then when the when the administrative court says well it was okay then he has to go through the regular federal courts that doesnt seem to me like a realistic remedy not for somebody who claims hes being systematically harassed for five years as as is the claim here 
 again i think you have to assume that his claims would not succeed either at the administrative level or at the apa level and if he got 
 i dont assume that at all even if they even if they succeed they say yes you are right they trespassed good for you i mean what is the remedy if they did trespass what administrative remedy does he obtain 
 well if theres a trespass he can go he can obtain an action under the federal tort claims act a trespass is an unauthorized taking thats the way that this court has treated it N in the hasselly case 
 what the photographing of his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and they pay him for that and then he claims that the blm follows them just to harass them just taking photographs what relief could he get for that 
 well he claimed that they were trespassing on his lands 
 lets assume they wasnt trespassing 
 well hed raised that objection before the ibla and the ibla concluded and we think reasonably that given the history of the disputes with this individual given his litigious nature that it was reasonable for the blm officials who were out there to be documenting his trespasses on public lands and thats an important dimension of this case 
 i thought there was one aspect of the videotaping his guests that the government was doing it on its own land on public land they had cameras and the cameras were stationed so they werent trespassing they were just making the guests feel uncomfortable 
 to document to document his trespasses on other lands and thats the citation to the ibla decision is at footnote N of our reply brief and it discusses that allegation in depth in any event 
 i would really like to have your answer to my opening question and i said if your only answer is each time something he is charged by the blm people he goes one at a time engaging a lawyer spending a lot of time but it was one of the briefs called it dying a thousand deaths he doesnt want that he wants to say stop stop this whole pattern not one citation stop this whole pattern how does he get that remedy 
 he does not have a remedy under the just compensation clause or bivens justice ginsburg 
 what does what does he have 
 he can challenge he can challenge these actions under the administrative process available to him under the 
 piecemeal 
 apa 
 piecemeal 
 like any number of other contexts 
 does he have any action that is other than piecemeal 
 he has to challenge each administrative action 
 i take it the answer is no 
 that he claims is unlawful 
 were any of these administrative actions found to be unfounded in other words did he win any of the trespass citations 
 he did not in fact the ibla found that the blm had a right of administrative access to cross his lands to get to public lands which it was administering and again this case would have been quite different if the ibla had found that the blm officers were acting without legitimate authority 
 im surprised you say piecemeal i would have thought most agencies in the government have like an inspector general or someone that you can complain 
 and they do 
 you can write them a letter and you say look at whats been going on they have been trespassing they have indicted me on a false charge i want you to see the whole list here and id like you to do something about it and if they dont do anything about it you go to your senator maybe you can go to the newspapers i mean has any of that happened here 
 it has justice breyer it has 
 and whats been the result of that 
 the result of that is it was determined that these actions by these line officers of the bureau of land management were perfectly appropriate that they were dealing with someone who has systematically violated the permits and conditions that are found 
 who made that who made that determination including the selective citations 
 i believe there was an inspector general investigation investigation within the department of interior that 
 i thought the department of interior reached a settlement agreement in which they told the line people at blm to stop 
 there was a settlement agreement justice ginsburg but the department of interior stands behind the actions that are issued at issue in this case and i think 
 nonetheless they did enter a settlement which included that this behavior was going to stop 
 well im not sure that thats a fair characterization i mean like any party to litigation any party to multiple lawsuits and claims there are many reasons why it might be deemed in the interest of a person to agree to a settlement and i dont think its fair to 
 would you agree at least to a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this proceeding that what the complaint alleged and what the district court said on summary judgment there was sufficient evidence to go to a trial that thats true so we have to accept his allegations that there were selective citations for violations of grazing grazing laws that they broke into his lodge and messed the place up 
 this court has to accept those factual allegations to 
 okay so thats 
 to be sure but the court of 
 so thats the case we have and you are telling me that the only remedy a citizen assuming the truth of those allegations is to fight these actions one by one 
 thats a fulsome remedy justice ginsburg when you think of the claims that could be brought administratively under the administrative procedures act under the federal tort claims act to receive damages to receive injunctions 
 what damages would you get for the trespass of a one one blm agent on your land a lot of money you are going to get for that would it would it come anywhere close to reimbursing you for the lawyers fees that its taken to go to go all the way through the litigation 
 if the allegation is that these trespasses have in effect deprived me of my property which is my business then conceivably he could make a request for a large amount of damages 
 he doesnt say it deprived him of his property which is his business 
 no i think 
 he is saying its a trespass get off my land 
 he he has made both claims justice scalia and i think he has he has complained about blm officials exercising the right of administrative access which has been confirmed at the administrative level and which is well settled and he has made the more general complaint that these trespasses have and interfered with his businesses and interfered with his property he filed a a bond in this court seeking claiming the damages were in several million dollars related to the business so that 
 can he get injunctive relief can he get injunctive relief you said something about that you said they may seek to enjoin conduct that they claim will amount to an uncompensated taking can he have this litany of things that have happened and go into a court and say court enjoin those 
 certainly he could under the apa he could challenge the administrative actions he complained about and if court concludes those are unauthorized or unconstitutional he could obtain an injunction 
 he can bring he can bring this he could bring this not one action at a time but he could complain all at once about everything 
 well the other thing to keep in mind is that many of these discrete administrative actions for example take the cancellation of the permits that was based on a course of conduct that included N formal trespasses disregarding trespass notices by the blm N violations of his grazing permits all of that would be part of a record before the ibla and before a federal court in an apa it would have an opportunity to review those allegations and determine whether or not the alleged federal action was unlawful and if a court believed 
 he could he could not go into a federal court with a federal question he would have to go to the initial decision maker then the i 
 he would have to exhaust his administrative remedies just like any number of other people who believe that they have been wronged by the federal government 
 part of his claim is is selective enforcement you know maybe he did trespass maybe some of his cattle did stray on somebodys land but they are beating on him because of what they say is his failure to give a reciprocal easement which the government is entitled to to what extent was any of the administrative approval of the blm agents actions to what extent was that based on the legitimacy of seeking to extract this reciprocal easement from him because i dont see that its legitimate at all 
 well the i let me answer that in two ways first the ibla found that there was not an effort to extort or blackmail mr the respondent for exercising his rights 
 was that because the government was entitled to the reciprocal easement is that why they said that 
 well 
 it wasnt extortion because he should have given the easement 
 no i dont think thats what the ibla found and we cite the part of the ibla record at footnote N of our reply brief secondly its well established that the government can seek reciprocal arrangements with respect to property the court in the leo sheep case forced the government to seek reciprocal arrangements 
 not after not after they have already given away i mean yes they could come to him anew and say i will tell you what if you give us this easement we will give you yet another one 
 thats true 
 but he had one in from the past which which his predecessor had given a reciprocal easement for and the government failed to record the easement and therefore was is deprived of it 
 thats true but i think its important to keep in mind the scope of the claim before the court 
 and they are mad at him for not giving back that easement which they failed to record 
 the blm doesnt have to stop enforcing its laws and regulations once someone refuses to enter into reciprocal arrangements there are thousands of reciprocal arrangements 
 it wouldnt be reciprocal what was the government offering to give him in exchange for his his reaffirming the prior easement that they had failed to record what was the government giving him in exchange 
 a valuable rightofway justice scalia that that was for N years that covered N miles of public road 
 but thats what his predecessor had 
 he had that already 
 well but that did not convey with the property it had to be reassigned in order for mr robbins to take advantage of that rightofway 
 i did not i did not understand that 
 absolutely and its in the regulations the rightofway has to be reassigned and it wasnt going to be reassigned because respondent refused to agree to the reciprocal easement and because he refused to make rental payments 
 as originally negotiated with i think nelson was the rightofway cancellable at any time or how long would the rightofway last 
 the rightofway was for N years which was long than the N year easement that the government got in exchange and this something that was negotiated at arms length by parties that didnt have the acrimonious relationship that developed between respondent and the blm 
 counsel i i think part of whats happening here is there is difference between the regulation on the books and how they are enforced just as a hypothetical lets say they dont the government doesnt get its reciprocal easement that it wants and so it says look we normally dont strictly enforce these cattle trespass things but we are going to go by the book with this guy until he gives us the rightofway every time his cattle cross over the line we are going to hit him with a trespass citation they dont do it for anybody else but they are going to do it for him because they want to get the reciprocal rightofway is that appropriate or inappropriate 
 well first i dont think it gives him a cause of action under bivens or the just compensation clause second 
 so that he cant but you are saying his remedy is to challenge each one but actually each one his cattle did trespass so he doesnt have a good case its just that out in the west they dont actually give citations every time a cow crosses the river 
 then i then i dont think he is a very sympathetic plaintiff to be complaining that he is entitled to violate blm rules or regulations there is a certain amount of give and take that we think is inherent in these reciprocal arrangements and we think that the just compensation clause tolerates these are the just compensation clause or property rights here are protected fundamentally by state law thats why any unauthorized action by the government is a trespass which is which is dealt with under state law the just compensation 
 well why is it a state law matter why didnt he know about this possibility why didnt he know that his predecessor in title had granted why wasnt there an actual notice given the fact that everybody in this area of the country seems as a matter of course to give mutually beneficial rightsofway i agree it wasnt recorded 
 i think he was on notice the blm made a determination that because it wasnt recorded it wouldnt seek to enforce that against respondent it may be that it was it made a legal error on that i dont know but it made that determination 
 thats a given in the record the record is that he was not on notice so whether one says gee thats unlikely if he wasnt 
 but in any event the point is that the blm recognized that it had to negotiate a new reciprocal arrangement with respondent and it sought to do so 
 and its trying to cover for its own sloppiness or carelessness in not recording 
 well it its trying to seek establish a new reciprocal arrangement regardless of why it was back in the position of having to do so it did so in a way that it did in any number of other situations that did arise 
 can i ask you about the bivens theory here before your time runs out doesnt davis versus passman help the respondent here 
 i i dont think so your honor i think what is distinct about the bivens claim here is first bivens and just compensation clause claims are fundamentally incompatible and that in bivens its damages are nothing here the constitutional right actually explicitly provides a remedy just compensation secondly just compensation claims are claims against the government 
 well thats because we assume its focused just on his property and that the property was ultimately the thing that was in issue but if you have all these other retaliatory actions and wrongful actions taken by the government tangential to this dispute i take it davis versus passman broadly read says we can use bivens if there is no other way to get a remedy against the government 
 well two points first davis versus passman was decided in a day in which this court was much more likely to infer new causes of action from the constitution or from statutes the court in its recent cases most recently malesko has said that its sworn off that habit and its refused to recognize any new bivens action in N years since those cases were decided secondly the respondent here has ample remedies and avenues that he could seek if he believes that there has been unauthorized trespass he can seek damages under the federal tort claims act 
 suppose we think suppose we disagree with you on the latter point we think he is really in a bind theres not really anything he can do doesnt that invoke the davis versus passman rationale 
 i 
 to expand it would be an expansion of bivens 
 it would be closer to it but the court would still have to confront the question of whether it would be appropriate to infer a constitutional tort under the just compensation clause and we would urge the court not to do so there is an overarching question here of qualified immunity whatever is true with respect to whether this new constitutional tort should be created towards other claims before the court the petitioners on this case were not on clear notice that their actions in responding to someone who had systematically violated the rules and regulations which on the books for some time would subject them to personal damages actions and in fact treble damages under the rico statute for that for that 
 if a including you know busting into his lodge and disrupting the furniture and all of that they thought that that was probably 
 well if thats true 
 probably allowed 
 if thats they would be on notice that that conduct if true could subject them to a tort action under the federal tort claims act there is no decision that the court of appeals or respondent has pointed to that would put the petitioners here on notice in the specific situation they confronted that their actions could subject them to a constitutional tort which had never been recognized by any court whether their actions could subject them to treble damages under rico 
 is that a test for for for qualified immunity you have to know not only 
 you have to have 
 its not enough to know that your action was wrongful you have to know the particular statute or constitutional provision under which a remedy would be sought 
 yes the first question is whether he has established a violation of the right and the rights that are alleged in this case that are before this court or a right under the compensation clause of the fifth amendment to 
 so you are suggesting they would not be immune from a state law trespass action 
 no the the the congress has waived the sovereign immunity from those types of claims under the federal tort claims act 
 the people who had done this 
 but the federal tort claims act is against the united states its not against the 
 its against the united states if they are acting within the scope of their conduct if its unauthorized actions outside the scope of the conduct then they can go directly against the individuals thats 
 but then it wouldnt be a federal tort claims act 
 well then it would be additional suits in state court they could also there are also state federal and criminal laws that they could seek to invoke or have invoked but 
 but respect to the rico claim assuming the rico claim is upheld what do you say to your brothers argument that there is no history of qualified immunity for rico claims that the qualified immunity doctrine addresses the the kind of development of squishier law under under N so that you simply have not qualified immunity 
 two things justice souter first the argument was not raised below we dont think its properly before the court second the question under qualified immunity and this court made this clear in the wyatt case and again in the knight case it doesnt look to the particular offense it looks to the nature of the responsibility that the government officials are performing and here the nature of the responsibilities are enforcing grazing permits enforcing access to public lands activities that blm officials have discretion and have had discretion for more than a century to enforce and we think that falls squarely within the rubric of qualified immunity 
 well that may be a very it seems to me that those may be good arguments or at least relevant arguments against the applicability of rico in the first place but if rico is found to have been violated i take it it would be an extension of qualified immunity jurisprudence 
 i dont 
 to to apply it to a rico defendant 
 with respect i dont think it would be first the large portion of the courts of appeals that have addressed this have concluded that qualified immunity principles do extend to rico and second again the focus of the inquiry is on the nature of the responsibilities its not on the particular offense alleged its not on whether theres a violation of that offense its the nature of the responsibilities and here these responsibilities enforcing permits enforcing access and use of public land and protecting against abuse of those lands are things that blm officials and other government officers have exercised their discretion to do for more than 
 if this case were identical everythings the same except that the officials involved are state officials would there be a N action 
 well no because we dont think that theres a violation of the just compensation clause when someone doesnt take property when someone doesnt act through allegedly 
 thats a different thats a different reason thats a merits defense i just wondered if 
 oh are you the question with respect to qualified immunity 
 yeah you are saying there is no bivens action period 
 well we think that qualified immunity now 
 no im not even thinking of it i just wonder if N would apply and it would be clear that there is an action if you win there would be no problem 
 no because there has been no violation of the substantive fifth amendment right and there has been no violation of bivens its important to recognize the overarching context of how the federal government manages the public lands there are there are numerous reciprocal arrangements that could be affected by this any time a landowner refuses to enter into a reciprocal arrangement he can then turn around in any government action that is taken against that landowner all he has to do is add on an element of wrongful subjective intent and he can bring a constitutional tort claim or even a rico claim like the respondent here and subject officers to the threat of personal liability and we think that this would have a significant skewing effect on legitimate government decision making if i could reserve the remainder of my time 
 thank you counsel mr tribe 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court there is a dramatic contrast between the instantaneous judgments a school principal might have to make in the face of complicated decisions like tinker and a deliberate decision over a course of almost a dozen years made by officials of the bureau of land management that the greater retaliate against someone for refusing to relinquish his property to the government without any compensation you dont have to have taken a special course in constitutional law to know that that is clearly forbidden 
 mr tribe can i get something straight is it indeed correct that what the government was seeking here was an exchange of easements that the government was going to give one and your client would give the other 
 no justice scalia thats not correct that was what they did with nelson his predecessor 
 with the predecessor in interest of your client 
 thats right and what happened 
 did what the government gave to your predecessor of interest did that easement continue the government has just said that it expired 
 the government is wrong it continued 
 thats how i understood it 
 it ran with the land it was part of what he brought if it had expired 
 this is the easement over the roadway 
 the rightofway over the governments roads 
 as opposed to the grazing easement 
 as thats right the rightofway over the road of access which they not only canceled in july of N but refused to maintain themselves so that he couldnt really access the ranch 
 if they finally canceled it how did it i mean if it runs with the land they dont have the authority to cancel 
 they didnt have the authority to cancel it simply because of the transfer of the land they allege that he had made various technical violations on account of which they canceled it but the key point is that was supposed to be the quid pro quo that is they have maintained all along that this case is about that rightofway and what an ingrate the respondent is that he wants to continue enjoying it and not give the easement well he didnt enjoy it after july of N when it was canceled they wouldnt have had to cancel it for alleged violations 
 i dont care whether it was canceled but i must say if they were just seeking a fair exchange of reciprocal easements which landowners do all the time 
 right 
 and the system of lands out there cant work without it 
 uhhuh 
 i wouldnt see anything terribly wrong about the blm people say okay he wants to play hardball he wants to play by the book we will play by the book what would be wrong with 
 they didnt 
 see i wouldnt feel bad about that if they said 
 i wouldnt either 
 by god every time his cows trespass we are going to get him every time his hunting expeditions go on public land we are going to get him that would seem reasonable to me so it really is crucial to my view of the case that the government was not seeking a new exchange it was seeking 
 thats right 
 for him to cough up 
 to cough up that easement and in fact when he said he offered to negotiate and the immediate response from mr vessels who is since diseased was the united states does not negotiate that wasnt just kind of starting of a bargaining position they dug in and for a series of years the district court found fully substantiated on the petition appellate via appendix to the petition at page N a not only playing hardball and being selectively tough on him but a number of clearly illegal acts breaking into his lodge one of them particularly striking to me at joint appendix N to N inciting a neighbor to ram a truck into the respondent while he was on horseback firemen 
 who would have thought wait when you say that i mean theres a lot of these acts it seems they are plainly illegal 
 sure 
 well if they are plainly illegal then there are remedies in the courts 
 there are remedies one by one for each of these acts 
 all right but what is actually worrying you which probably you can address at some point is this there are remedies one by one thats true and each has one and maybe you can even get injunctions against harassing 
 well the remedies were acquittal he was acquitted for example 
 well maybe he didnt do it 
 he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars 
 and so it may be they thought he did do it and 
 no no they didnt think he did do it 
 all right 
 he alleged 
 did you bring a suit for malicious prosecution 
 thats part of this is a suite like hartman v moore one of the acts that is clearly actionable under bivens if one has to dissect the various predicate acts is the fact that without probable cause at page N of the joint appendix they deliberately fabricated a felony charge 
 all right now 
 and when he was acquitted of that by a jury that took N minutes and said that they were outraged by the blm they found other things to do they found other things 
 but he also lost the malicious prosecution suit didnt he didnt he bring a malicious prosecution suit 
 he tried to do that 
 and he lost 
 he won some he lost some but the 
 maybe he should have won whats worrying me throughout if you want to know 
 i sure do 
 all right 
 what is worrying me throughout is put this case to the side if the court recognizes what i take it has not happened in the past that there is an action for private people to bring against the government bivens under the fifth amendment all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations the coal pillars in holmes case everything south of that will be suddenly in federal court as people claim that whats going on with this regulation is there are individuals in the government who have gone too far and they are just trying to get my property and the use of it without paying a fair price now by the way sometimes people in government do go too far so many of those claims might have some justification but suddenly i see the possibility of this kind of action becoming a major roadblock an obstacle sometimes used unjustifiably and not necessarily not necessary this kind of thing to impose a roadblock to totally legitimate government regulatory action 
 justice breyer that that floodgates concern was addressed by this court not long enough in hartman v moore when the remedy in that case for a prosecution that was brought to retaliate against someone for the exercise of her first amendment right was a bivens action against the postal inspectors who made this all up now the court there addressed the possibility that this would unleash a flood of lawsuits and it said that over the past quarter century there had been only N bivens or N actions against this kind of retaliation i suppose that is because not that many postal inspectors or blm guys think they can get away with deliberately retaliating against people for exercising their rights 
 you see part of whats worrying me is that once you get into the fifth amendment which is prevents the government from taking property for a public use without just compensation the possibility of the legal imagination becomes endless because every time a person walks across the doorstep every time a person wants to install a pipe in the basement read the meter i mean i can see possibilities of actions of this kind arising and particularly when the government wants to buy it and is pointing out all the reasons why it should be sold is there a threat lurking in that conversation you see what im worried about here which wasnt present in the other case 
 i see but it was present in davis davis v passman to which justice kennedy referred already recognized a bivens action for violating something even more capacious due process equal protection when this court said in village of willowbrook against oleck that there is a cause of action even for the naked assertion that you are treating me differently did that open huge floodgates have we been flooded it seems to me that the court has developed its own filters against the floodgate of retaliation claims its been 
 im not sure professor tribe that the cases you cite at page N N of your brief really support your position the question is whether there should be a freestanding cause of action for damages 
 thats correct 
 and in the brief you say that the government says that this is limited first amendment and then you say these remarkable claims are unsurprisingly false i thought that was a rather severe charge against the government that its misrepresenting its cases 
 uhhuh 
 then in page N and N you go ahead and you talk about wisconsin versus yoder lefkowitz versus turley bordenkircher which i think was vindictive prosecution or adding on charges all of those are in the every one of these cases are in the context of a criminal proceeding griffin a murder case its just alleging a constitutional 
 but many of them are not justice kennedy 
 alleging a constitutional claim well which one 
 well for example shapiro v thompson the court has said that the right to travel cannot be penalized the broad point that 
 well no that was there was an existing case or controversy there that wasnt a freestanding cause of action none of these cases are freestanding davis versus passman different 
 and hartman v moore different what we were answering there was not the point about a freestanding cause of action 
 well it seems to me that those cases do not support your position and i dont think its correct to say that this is unsurprising that the government makes a false representation about cases 
 well justice kennedy that was a response to their claim that only with respect to the fifth amendment is there a right this was not the bivens question only with respect to the fifth first amendment is there a right not to be retaliated against for the exercise of your rights 
 i think it was in the context of a freestanding right but lets leave that aside 
 we can look at it 
 thats right it does seem to me that you are asking us to extend bivens this is an extension would you accept that 
 in the sense that there has never been a case just like it under hope v pelzer there doesnt have to have been one like it but we do think that there is a compelling case because theres no other way to enforce the just compensation right against a group of government agents who are determined to pile punishment upon punishment until someone caves in 
 well you say you call it punishment but in fact the governments position on each of these particulars has generally been vindicated when your client has appealed they have upheld the trespass citations when you have sued for malicious prosecution the suits been rejected which of the government actions do you not have an existing remedy for apart from the racketeer and corrupt rico act or the this new bivens claim 
 mr chief justice it is the retaliatory pattern that there is no remedy for when going 
 can you point to any one governmental action for which you do not have an existing remedy 
 well the action of falsely prosecuting him in retaliation 
 you have a malicious prosecution claim for that you brought that you lost 
 no we did not bring a malicious prosecution claim for that felony charge 
 you could have brought one 
 it would have been against federal officials and that would have been then transformed unless we brought it under bivens which is what we are trying to do transformed into an action against the united states by the westfall act that is all of these attempts 
 and then if you would have succeeded you would have been compensated 
 for that one event from the united states but the blm agents would not have been deterred in any event carlson v green 
 no but the theory of the tort claims act is that if the government is paying out of the treasury its going to see to it that its employees dont continue to commit the tort so i dont think i dont think you can make the argument that it would have had no effect on the improper behavior 
 i think the most important point that im trying to make justice souter and mr chief justice that when someone says i do not want to give you my property you have to take it from me and give me just compensation the position of the government here is that there is no constitutional limit on the kind of retaliation they can engage in 
 well if the position of the government were more fairly represented they would say we dont want everyone to be able to claim that everything we are doing under color of law is retaliation because then we will hear that against irs agents we will hear it against osha agents so long as you and their position is you have a remedy for everything you are complaining about and you invoked some of them and you lost you didnt invoke others and so you didnt prevail but dont create a whole new remedy just because you are dissatisfied with having to pursue each one individually 
 well bivens as a constitutional tort is not a new remedy the question really is whether there is any conceivable basis when they trash his lodge when they do all of the other things for treating this differently from another kind of constitutional violation i mean they argue that its very important even though we could have lots of people bringing unjustified suits to have a bivens remedy for retaliation against free speech the reason that they give is that free speech is easily chilled but with property rights the just compensation clause is kind of its own antifreeze 
 no the reason would be probably that the if you can make a comparison the number of government actions that affect criminal charges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of governmental actions that affect peoples property virtually i mean the number of government actions affecting how people use their property its the whole series of law books it fills the room and suddenly to open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is whats frightening me which is what i said already so you dont have to answer 
 but justice breyer the court has established in the area of retaliation against people for the exercise of their rights title vii rights in burlington first amendment rights 
 retaliation what is retaliation isnt retaliation statutory 
 its statutory 
 hartman is not statutory some of the hartman is the first amendment and its the bivens case the point i was trying to make about that is that the court has a body of law trying to filter out through requiring proof of causation requiring proof of substantial injury filter out these trivial cases where someone is simply making a nuisance 
 mr tribe could i ask a question about the rico claims 
 certainly 
 until i read this case i had never come across the concept that a government employee can be guilty of extortion by demanding money for the government and your brief didnt cite very much authority for this anywhere in the history of extortion 
 in the common law history justice alito we cited two cases from new york the whaley case in N and willett in N and it was that body of new york law from which the hobbs act largely drew those were cases in which the courts said that the fact that the government agent is extorting property for his own employer the government doesnt make any difference it is still extortion 
 thats not a lot of thats not a lot of authority considering the long history of extortion just two old new york cases 
 there are plenty of cases justice alito that involve extortion for ones employer where the employer might be a union or a corporation or a charitable body but its true the hobbs act has not been applied in my research anyway i have not seen it applied to this kind of extortion but the language clearly covers it and the language of rico clearly covers it 
 suppose you have a librarian in a courthouse and the librarian is charging lawyers N cents a page for photocopies but theres some library rule that says the fee is supposed to be N cents a page now is that is that a rico 
 if the librarian thinks that the legislature is not giving us enough money so im going to deliberately use my authority to get an extra five cents from everybody i suppose if you could prove willfulness which is an important element of hobbs and if there were several librarians and there was a pattern and you could establish the other prerequisites of rico it could be a rico violation 
 well the two cases you cite the first one is the person who was charged with extortion is a judge 
 thats right 
 and he was extorted on the ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant so the money wasnt given to the government so i dont see that thats a difference and then the second case 
 the second case 
 it may have been but you say see also which is a sign to me theres something wrong with that case 
 i dont i dont think there is justice breyer and its very short 
 im surprised that you didnt put it first if there wasnt page N 
 well willett versus devoy it involved a clerk demanding more money than the law allowed and the court said no distinction is made on the ground that the official keeps the fee or turns it over to the government such a judgemade restriction on the general statute requiring that the money be kept by the individual might itself bring about uncertainty confuse and possibly great injustice 
 why did you say see also 
 i dont remember 
 you say this clearly establishes are the blm folks supposed to have known about willett versus devoy 
 no 
 as clearly establishing their liability for what you call extortion im sure what they would call trying to save the taxpayers money and getting the type of reciprocal agreement with this landowner that they have got with thousands of others 
 well mr chief justice first of all when you keep calling it a reciprocal agreement it does trouble me they werent giving him anything for this easement which they had already extracted from his predecessor 
 you agree if the case were otherwise and i gather we have a factual dispute on that that it would have been all right i mean if he didnt have this other easement already but they were trying to negotiate it that this type of playing hardball i guess is one way to put it would be all right 
 it makes all the difference in the world they were trying to get the easement for nothing i mean its very much 
 well thats what im trying to get to see if you agree with that in other words everything about this case would otherwise be im sure not breaking the laws but otherwise it would be all right if they were trying to get a reciprocal easement 
 well most of what they did would not have been an okay method of getting a reciprocal easement anyway but the attempt to get it would be fine its not that they are not entitled to a reciprocal easement that might have been a problem under nollan and dolan to figure out whether there was enough connection but i think there would have been enough the problem was that they were using the rightofway which was long gone as an excuse to get an invaluable piece of property that they had no right to get they were then trying to they were basically saying and they made it explicit give us this easement for nothing or we will bury you 
 mr tribe i will tell what you troubles me about this case there are overzealous government agents there always have been and i am sure that assuming all of the misbehavior described here is correct im sure it is not the first time this has happened government agents sometimes get overzealous but why should there be this extraordinary remedy when the overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire to get a piece of land whereas if they had just picked on this guy because they didnt like the way he combed his hair or for any other reason and had done the same things you wouldnt have your bivens action right 
 nor would nollan have come out the same way if they werent trying to get an easement in return for something which wasnt which you called extortion 
 no no if they were trying to get some other property for it or or or money for it it didnt turn 
 i guess the straightforward answer that i would give to your question i think is that the constitution does guarantee that the government cannot take your property for public use without just compensation 
 the whole spectrum of possible government misbehavior selective enforcement the whole spectrum the only the only times we are going to allow a cause of action under bivens or under under not N yes the only times we are going to do that is when there is a demand for property 
 you have certainly done it with respect to the eighth amendment you have done it with respect to speech you have done it with respect to 
 but professor tribe all these cases are cases in which there is nollan you have a cause of action to challenge the permit and this is just a this is just a constitutional defense thats different from a freestanding cause of action and i share justice scalias concern it seems to me in thinking about this case there is there could be something very wrong here going after a person because of what hes done suppose the government wants somebody to be a witness in a trial and he wont do it and they go around hurting his business they go around invading his property and so forth that to me is outrageous and you might have an argument that there should be a bivens cause of action for that and justice scalias question i had the same question is why do we think it to the property the essence here the essence of whats going on is that they are being vindictive against this person now again the cases you are citing include hartman which is a free speech case which is different really dont support you i think this is an extension of bivens 
 justice kennedy if its an extension its i think implicit in bivens logic bivens deals with the cases 
 fair enough but its an extension of bivens 
 the fifth amendment is different from the first but is it different in a relevant way the just compensation clause does give the government an incentive if they can avoid having to use eminent domain and tax the public gives them an incentive to try to squeeze property out of somebody if it has any incentive effect its one that points to the need for a bivens remedy why is a bivens remedy 
 but are they disabled from negotiating if they go up to somebody and say you know wed really like a rightofway because we have some interest in lands that we need to maintain on the other side and the person says no and you know get off my property do they have to shrug their shoulders and say all right or can they say well you know we are neighbors we have a lot of interests in common and we should work together is that all of a sudden extortion 
 no mr chief justice working together is what this guy tried to do at the beginning he said im happy to negotiate 
 so how many trespass 
 they said we dont negotiate 
 citations for his cattle does it take before its all of a sudden extortion 
 the record in the case shows that on those very instances where he was cited with trespass others who were doing the identical thing were not and the ibla has said 
 and he challenged the citations and they were rejected 
 the ibla rejected them because it said it has no jurisdiction this was at in its decision at N ibla in N no jurisdiction to consider whether the motive was retaliatory whether it was unconstitutional whether it was part of a pattern and this court has said that one cant use the apa in that way either nor could an injunction be used to get a pattern like this because of rule N d and international longshoremen try to frame an injunction saying dont keep trashing this guy and ruining his business and harassing and surveilling his guests and whatever else you can come up with in order to squeeze his property out of him no other remedy will work 
 so are you saying that there was therefore no way short of bivens even to challenge or even to vindicate his claim of selective prosecution 
 he could have taken that one item and under a decision like hartman vindicated it but as is clear from the way he tried to challenge these individual things and then concluded as we explained in our brief that it was taking years and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars more than was involved in each individual one that was hopeless 
 i appreciate that but i thought you made the further claim maybe i misunderstood it that if he had gone from the administrative tribunal or attempted to to get into the district court he could not have gotten into district court under the act 
 well he wouldnt have had because he would have had no record that is the review under the apa by the district court would have been based on the evidentiary record he made and the ibla specifically ruled that it would not entertain evidence about the reasons that the blm officials had for going after him there would be no evidence to support his claim 
 could he have gone into the district court and said i tried to make a record but they wouldnt let me let me make a record now could he have done that 
 i believe the district courts jurisdiction in reviewing a final agency action is limited to the agency record 
 no no you can go to an agency and say agency i want to do such and such dah dah dah here are my reasons agency says no i want review 
 so a challenge to the iblas assertion 
 i dont know you might have written to the secretary of the interior secretary i want to you do such and such please no okay review 
 well he did write to the secretary of the interior 
 and what happened 
 he was not given an answer so what can one say the district court decided lest you assume that because he wasnt given an answer he doesnt have a case the district court said as hard as it is to prove these things he has substantial evidence that they were picking on him solely to get the property not because they didnt like him not for some other reason they were trying to get property for which they were unwilling to pay its doubtful that they could have taken it by eminent domain because the laws limiting the ability of the blm require proving necessity and there is nothing in the record suggesting that they needed this easement there is plenty in the record suggesting that he couldnt access his own property as long as the roadway wasnt maintained in a passable condition and one of the ways they retaliated against him was to refuse to maintain the roadway the record is also clear that his business suffered greatly so that if the result is that someone who is trying to insist that if you want my property you have to take it by eminent domain and give me just compensation cant get help in those other ways this is crucial what would have happened in kaiser aetna if when the government said we think we have an easement to the laguna pond instead of going to court which they did and they lost if they had said well we are going to ram our motor boats or invite people to ram their motor boats into your sailboat we are going to ruin your business in the kuapa pond until you give the public an easement only a bivens cause of action which the court has recognized in other areas in other constitutional claims due process free speech eighth amendment only a bivens cause of action is directly responsive to that 
 no a an action against the government for ramming your sailboat is directly responsive to that you get you get full recovery 
 the westfall act makes an exception when you are making a constitutional claim that is in N when the court passed the westfall act there were two exceptions N b and were constitutional claims and statutory claims 
 you dont need the constitution to the sue the government for ramming your sailboat basic state tort law 
 mr chief justice 
 you can answer 
 it seems to me that state tort law does not get at the harm that he has suffered it gets at each individual piece but the main harm he suffered is that they are circumventing the just compensation clause as the one way that the fifth amendment was designed to permit the government to get property for public use thank you 
 thank you counsel 
 thank you mr chief justice 
 mr garre you have four minutes remaining 
 thank you mr chief justice first i want to clarify the question of the assignment and our position its always been our position that a new rightofway had to be issued after the property was sold and i will point the court to ja N which is where the blm officials made clear at the outset that an assignment was required point the court to ja N which is the rightofway 
 they might have been lying about that 
 well 
 just as they lied about a lot of other stuff according to 
 pointing to ja N which is the rightofway which says that in accordance with federal regulations and i point the court to N cfr N which discusses assignments and makes clear that assignments have to be approved 
 i thought there was something about nelson having assigned his the rightofway that he had to the government 
 justice ginsburg assignments have to be approved by the blm thats 
 yes but it wasnt that it was a new assignment it was the former owner assigned it and the bla blm approved 
 it was never approved and thats clear there was never any valid assignment thats why the reciprocal arrangement had to be negotiated anew and again i point to N 
 well then why did you revoke it later if it wasnt valid 
 it it was revoked as part of the decision not to assign it and thats clear from the decision canceling the rightofway there was no assignment that could be approved and rents had not been paid on it so it was combined with the assignment 
 why wouldnt there be an assignment why why would the prior owner have any any interest in not assigning it 
 in order for the rightofway because these are rightsofway to public lands they have to approved by new once new property owners seek to assert them and again the 
 the prior owner did assign it the stopper was the blm 
 but but again its clear and it was not approved and one of the reasons it wasnt approved was because rents werent paid and he wasnt agreeing by the terms and conditions of the regulations which are part of the rightofway and thats at ja N the next point i wanted to make justice kennedy is we agreed this would be a dramatic new extension of bivens and we agree with justice breyer the problems or types of litigations that this new constitutional tort would create are really just the capable of the imagination 
 davis versus passman is a different context but in theory is it consistent with what the respondent asks 
 no its not because the respondent here has more statutory and administrative remedies available to him than the plaintiff in passman did including claims under the federal tort claims act for trespasses for any of the other alleged wrongs that you have heard about here today these were these were wrongs that were addressed by the ibla and the apa 
 but their argument is broader it says you cant look at each little piece you have got to look at the overall structure and overall they are doing it to extort a property right they dont want to pay for and they are not doing other peoples cattle cross over and they dont prosecute them now lets assume thats correct on the facts are you saying that they have no remedy for that type of extortionate activity 
 they dont have a bivens remedy and they dont have a rico remedy id point the court to lujan versus national wildlife federation where the court said that in that situation what a plaintiff must do is challenge each administrative action individually and the types of programmatic pattern challenges are for congress they are for executive branches they are for inspector generals 
 but what do you what do you say to the argument that that you simply cannot follow that logic ultimately because when you get to the point of the sort of the you know the death by a thousand cuts which is what they are claiming here you can stitch up every cut but by the time you get to a thousand you are dead i mean they are making an argument that this is quantitatively so different that it is qualitatively different 
 i think the law and this court reasonably assumes that where individuals have remedies available to them through challenging individual 
 why is that a reasonable assumption in response to their argument 
 its reasonable to assume that if there are actions against united states under the federal tort claims act or actions finding government conduct unauthorized under the apa that the government will take action to prevent that here every action that was challenged was found to be appropriate and lawful under the existing regime we would urge the court to reverse 
 thank you counsel the case is submitted 
 the court will hear argument first today in case N morse vs frederick mr starr 
 mr chief justice and may it please the court illegal drugs and the glorification of the drug culture are profoundly serious problems for our nation congress has so recognized as has this court time and again the magnitude of the problem is captured in the amicus brief the court has a number of amicus briefs before it but the amicus brief of general mccaffrey secretary bennett and a number of organizations and particularly pages N to N of that brief the nature and the scope of the problem are wellcaptured 
 well is this case limited to signs about drugs what is the rule that you want us to adopt for deciding this case 
 the rule the court that it articulated in tinker the rule of the court as articulated in tinker is that there is in fact a right to political speech subject to disruption requirements that the speech not be disruptive 
 disruptive of what disruptive of the classroom order there was no classroom here 
 including but not limited to this was a school authorized event this was education outside of the classroom it was essentially a school simply out of doors it was essentially 
 well i can understand if they unfurled the banner in a classroom that it would be disruptive but what did it disrupt on the sidewalk 
 the educational mission of the school 
 no but i mean thats at a level of generality that doesnt get us very far i mean what specifically did it disrupt did it disrupt the parade did it disrupt teaching what was it 
 N a school policy of the board that says emphatically that political speech is protected embracing tinker 
 then if thats the rule the school can make any rule that it wants on any subject restrictive of speech and if anyone violates it the result is on your reasoning its disruptive under tinker 
 not at all i think that in form 
 then im missing the argument 
 the argument is that this court in tinker articulated a rule that allows the school boards considerable discretion both in identifying the educational mission and to prevent disruption of that mission and this is disruptive of the mission 
 well suppose you have suppose you have a mission to have a global school can they ban american flags on lapel pins 
 absolutely not because under tinker that is political expression let me be very specific this case is ultimately about drugs and other illegal substances 
 so if the sign had been bong stinks for jesus that would be and morse had the same reaction that this was demeaning to the olympics and it was unruly conduct that there would be a protected right under tinker because the message was not promoting drugs 
 she stated in her answers to interrogatories that she may very well not have interfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize marijuana under our theory we think she could have interfered with that because it was disruptive to the event it was disorderly to the event itself but the 
 what would be disorderly i dont understand this disorder if somebody holds up a sign and says change the marijuana laws why is it disruptive of anything simply because the school quite naturally has said we support the enforcement of the law and the law right now does forbid the use of marijuana 
 i 
 its political speech it seems to me i dont see what it disrupts unless disruption simply means any statement of disagreement with a position officially adopted by the school is that what you mean by disruption 
 no your honor first of all this is i think an unusual characterization namely for this to be called political speech we would 
 if its calling i mean 
 we think its a first im sorry 
 a call for a change in the law i would have supposed was political speech 
 that wasnt the interpretation your honor lets back up if i may someone has to interpret the message and the front line message interpreter is the school official the school official 
 well that may be but thats not the hypo the the hypothetical is what if there is a sign or a statement in the school calling for a change in you know the prohibition against marijuana use as a call for change in the law i would suppose it was political speech but as i understood the argument you were making it would still be regarded as an exception as it were to tinker because it was disruptive and it was disruptive in the sense that it disagreed with official school policy which was to enforce the law or support the law as it was is that your position on what disruption means under tinker 
 but our the answer is no because what we are also urging the court to consider is its gloss on tinker and frazier and also what this court said in kuhlmeier and in frazier the court was very clear the first three paragraphs in part three of the opinion in talking about the habits and manners of civility and inculcating the values of citizenship that in fact is what is happening here there is an effort of the to prevent a message that is inconsistent with a fundamental message of the schools which is the use of illegal drugs is simply verboten and we believe that is permitted under tinker 
 so you want to get away from a hypothetical then i dont know why you try to defend a hypothetical that involves a banner that says amend the marijuana laws thats not this case as you see it is it 
 well its certainly not this case but 
 this banner was interpreted as meaning smoke pot no 
 it was interpreted exactly yes it was interpreted as an encouragement of the drug culture and 
 are you arguing that there should be a sui generis rule for speech that advocates illegal drug use or this broader argument that the school can suppress any speech that is inconsistent with its educational mission as the school 
 i think that 
 defines it 
 i apologize the court can certainly decide this on very narrow grounds that there are certain substances illegal drugs we would include alcohol and tobacco thats part of the schools policy because those are illegal substances which are very injurious to health and this court has noted that in bernonia and in earls time and again it is that these are very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy sanctioned by congress and also noted by courts across the country that illegal drugs are so dangerous that schools are entitled to have a message going 
 but the problem the problem mr starr is that school boards these days take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well beyond education or protection from illegal substances and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards have adopted policies taking on the whole range of political issues now do they get to dictate the content of speech on all of those issues simply because they have adopted that as the part of their educational mission 
 no because that may very well be inconsistent with tinker tinker articulates a baseline of political speech is in fact protected subject to 
 well i think that i think you are right about that and i guess my question goes to how broadly we should read tinker i mean why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum for political debate simply because the students want to put that on their agenda presumably the teachers agenda is a little bit different and includes things like teaching shakespeare or the pythagorean theorem and just because political speech is on the students agenda im not sure that it makes sense to read tinker so broadly as to include protection of those that speech 
 this court has not read tinker quite so broadly in both frazier and in kuhlmeier and there are a couple of aspects of tinker that i think are worthy of note one that there was no written policy there so there was an issue of standardless discretion being exercised and also 
 but it may have made a difference in tinker if the school had a policy defend our troops in vietnam would that have brought this into the category that you are now carving out you said that tinker had no policy but suppose the school did have a policy patriotism we support our troops no bad speech about the war in vietnam should tinker have come out the other way 
 no it should not because there i think there are concerns with respect to what this court has identified it is trying to even in the public school setting quite apart from the university setting to cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas what is happening here of course in this case it can be decided very narrowly that drugs alcohol and tobacco just have no place in the schools and 
 yes but the rule you proposed i thought in response to my question is that the school has wide discretion to define its educational mission and it can restrict speech thats inconsistent with that mission 
 and thats what this court in 
 and it seems to me thats much broader than tinker now you said well there is an exception for political speech well but then you are right with justice ginsburgs hypothetical lets suppose that they have a particular view on a political issue no child left behind or foreign intervention and so forth 
 justice kennedy the words that you articulated are essentially quotes of frazier and kuhlmeier so there is a broadening of the lens and a restoration frankly of greater school discretion in those two cases than one might see in tinker they of course drew as you well know from justice blacks warning in dissent of tinker that the federal courts federal judiciary should not be extending itself unduly into the work of the school boards
