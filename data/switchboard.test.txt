it prevents a lot it is a great deterrent whether or not it
well i  i do not know  we
but you know it is pretty hard to try let is say
yes in a in a maximum security prison down in central virginia and the problem she had was not with the inmates at all the the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison i mean
they are um trying to make plastic goods that do not have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess
uh hundreds of years of spanish control in the in the spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who
figure why bother you know what is the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal
a you know some females i do not recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people
um we had a few down here but but not anything like kansas and this is the season for that
pitch their lot in with them or
right me either noise
period and  and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married
i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but
i think all around it it is going to help out a lot course
that if a citizen of the state being myself
because i mean i just love that song
you know but then again those that have physically assaulted somebody
and it just they seem to give more just the facts than opinions
sure
am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i am  troubled by too close a clinging to to the past and i am  also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
that is right you know the renaissance man and uh and if you get that you can and if you do well you can you can learn a job
uh she portrayed as a male and the nurse well i am  just i am  just thinking of pictures that ii have seen and and you know uh uh i  i suspect no no message was ever intended to be while what you have to be this gender
but i  i think definitely like today they just introduced the what is called the brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns and i think that
did did you did you hear what schwartzkopf had to say about uh pete arnett and uh the the news coverage
and so they were cleaning it up and the guy hit something he could not see what it was and so he dragged it up into the shallow end and it was a garbage can and inside the garbage can was a body
i know i know the insurance
to uh do it so i i opted not for that but
were you well you know well i think if we ever go it will only be for a three day now wei have been real lucky wei have been to europe twice
lower class is expanding and sooner or later there is going to there is going to be a turn around
oh wow
that is what they call them_n down here they get uh
yeah yeah they are car payments are outrageous now
so i guess that was a crime i got a year is probation for that
 i do not have that i do not have that uh  experience  to  share  uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of you know i do i switch the stations  stations a lot because i do not have a cassette player in my car um
people they allow in the united states per year or if there is even a i do not even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore do you know anything about that
any crime
so in other words that is the way they force people out noise
which  which is where we could be in threatened i guess you would say
let is see  uh fish  as far as fish i think my favorite place is uh dinger is over  over on forest lane
uh here is what went on in asia over the past week and there is maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs
yeah that
right now that could beat any computer
and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it is
yeah did you see goodfellas
i try to catch it
uh you know the vocalized noise
that is out on video i wanna watch that
right and then you let it carry it downstream
yeah i agree on that and you know it seems paid  compared to what we our salary is versus what our health care is
right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation noise
of an outfit called us shoe or something vocalized noise it was a computer subsidiary i do not know what a shoe company is doing running a computer company
well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money
and we had to walk before we had a car
oh my goodness it is sad you know they paid for those things anyway or our taxes do
tape it or something on the record mode or on the time  yeah
you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you did not build one over here
oh he is been a legend for so many years you know and i do not know were you here
noise a an auction one time at the church noise excuse me and uh one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars  noise
oh it is a uh it is a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
so it that is also a good reason why it it or good that it ended as soon as it did
uh huh  what club do you follow
and the bill would come in and i would pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you are overdue pay
and so that is been something that is been good for the noise you know in this area that you feel like um you know there is not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today  and i guess i do not know how people live with that everyday
because there is nothing in there that to rebil/rehabilitate rebilitate/rehabilitate rehabilitate  rebilihatate/rehabilitate them and then when they get out they because they have the {stigmatism} of being in jail they ca not 
but sometimes it all comes together
i know they they did a it was on a talk show uh they took uh uh the parents and then the uh the son and they compared income
and now if youi have served in desert storm you probably would be a a good candidate
yeah you know and it is not for uh not for protection or hunting or or anything just you know for all those reasons just you know nobody thinks anything about having a gun it is no big deal
uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape it is just that left knee that just does not want to do everything it used to
it  i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
well that is good keeps them_n active i am  sure  well it was good talking to you
you are casting the weight of the line
ii have ii have never
from texas oh 
checked out or whatever but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test
yeah they get pretty quick but uh
oh now that that really is 
yes
so that uh vocalized noise you know the commonwealth states could could easily you know leapfrog the uh
um they have i am  not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but
but noise uh the the other things the seasonings were so appealing 
professional sports team to where i was living
yeah i think that we are gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway
yeah let is see what all is on television oh if you do not have a vcr we just got one after nine years do not even spend your money on it yeah cause you know if you like movies like we do
they are in missouri and i could i  i know i know stories for sure that they just they they just well they ca not take the proper care of them_n most of them
and when the parole officer calls to check on them they are instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it
and you know it is sort of strange because it almost
and i am  somewhat cynical
vocalized noise you do not expect them_n to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there  um
or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it
and been tested
but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person is never done anything bad before according to the judicial system
yeah he he is he is not a the liability that he was that he used to be
well i had a a a little routine that i i did for uh warm ups and then i did some uh very
well i had an hmo up to this year i switched
um hum
to see if they did it or if they uh criticize you or put something in there wrong sure sure
yes very true i uh i agree with you there uh
it was um not that kind of hmo is where you have to go to their they are sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an hmo where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular
so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel so
um i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal form
i used to visualize my wife for vocalized noise many times my wife be lying there on the sofa and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with with its with its head right on her neck
yeah and then in in my back flower bed i have uh
and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need
you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think that is one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just um
now it is going to grow about um the plant itself will grow about
and it was a a cultural shock to me uh in terms of what i went through the high school is now called roberto  in fact
uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially
so far they had not run into the real psychos yet
it is so much better for me
i guess it is the truth we just keep  buying  this  stuff and we do not have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas
what um what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those
yeah i found it you know in the street
 do  you  do  you do you like salt it is it is in salt lake city right
it goes so slow and then there is nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting
uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be
over the years my kids have had friends like in the band that
yeah right well i can remember are are from from my childhood were the disco days and maybe that is changed a lot uh noise what  what  the way the way people dress and
the great satan of the recycling
ii have got eight more payments and it is paid for
get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four
um hum that is right where the the uniform as  as a waitress now your uniform really it might be a little expensive when you first buy it but you know that is it does not it is made of polyester so it does not stain like cotton or wool would you know
first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that
no not really the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh
i mean i i personally think life imprisonment
i think  then probably any city  any city in the country
i am  dallas um
uh not they hired me in nineteen eighty four so yeah but now they they uh they issued a statement about that about vocalized noise three months ago
yeah uh like september was hot and drier october
how long has it been since youi have had one
and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp
i had one lady one time they called in i just signed up my husband had had been on this project um and i  i she called in and it was all about we do not have children and it is all about um sending your kids to college and why you would advise them
but you are required to take a what we call a p t test physical uh physical training test uh twice a year
and i just i do not know i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people i have had this real problem with a a private individual i mean i i kind of looked at it like
noise went into malibu in california over on the coast and then went up the the big sur highway all the way up to san francisco
uh i think
the pressure that lobbyists can put
and then my daughter uh took piano for a while she also played bassoon and then she vocalized noise has taken dance well she took dance from the time she was about five
uh well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works
oh yeah
and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a it was late summer but it get it got  it got really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to
yeah and i  i think that uh noise it is a a tone of our times that politicians
even then they are skimming over they are very trivial  almost trivial with it
well do you think uh i mean i wonder the assumption is that it is a problem uh and ii have never actually had too many people explain to me why it is a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it is a problem
oh yeah it it is it is uh interesting uh with the computer to read the computer news and all that i i guess that is uh
noise well i do not know many rich that do not have enough tax breaks to i mean i am  talking about the really rich
the ticket the cheapest  the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty
student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today if we let is sit down and read together yeah um hum
reached our time limit
i do not know you know and and again there is something else that  you know there was a
klif cliff
that was what they had told their teachers and so that is what they did and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely
real funny about what she sprays
well i do not know tv shows what what can i tell you um basically junk that is on  television
and with rollers and uh modern latex paints you can wash up easily because_n they are water soluble
okay okay
and then newspapers and tv would be tied after that because uh maybe i will catch the the the evening news like ten o'clock on tv and i vocalized noise so that is a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
i very seldom like to watch there there is there is a there is a couple now that i tend to want to watch i like uh home improvement shows like bob vela is uh
but the other two were just lovely
well this is kind of ironic because i work in ti is legal department
but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month and i thought
no there there never was an undergraduate requirement it just everyone really everyone took to them very quickly because there were a number of them available and
uh huh sounds good
but  unfortunately  but unfortunately my my my wife leigh feels as though it is it is just been an inappropriate uh thing to to i mean that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it i mean
you know that
yeah i know it is been bothering me a lot but yeah i think normally  i think the weather overall has been um probably like you said probably a little bit warm and noise so noise
yeah talk too long
have a retrial or do they
bad timing
i do not know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we are putting money away already uh but i really think it is important to put these children someplace where in addition to
uh huh how long have you had them
and the american cars the uh one advantage one advantage  one big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less
and that is that is really neat
it really is it it is a great place to be and the uh it is nice to work with people uh who
as  as we did and as we sold arms to noise pardon me to iraq when we wanted them to fight iran and then uh and then it turned around and
are you still there this is something is wrong i do not know it sounds funny though does not it
and that is interesting music but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded
downtown boston yuppie you know tourist attraction
noise right i mean sunday dinner was at my grandmother is and you know like i said there would be thirty noise you know a thirty people and everyone would just bring things and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook and
right yeah people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools  because_n it means more to them
i think i saw that on tv one time they maybe it was cnn where they were demonstrating that or something similar to that
sure that is right that is right gosh they got they are mouthy enough anyway
oh these are so you have the sash windows in did  did uh did it go  go up and down oh i see
uh just by the vast number of people there are there is i think cars are also a major contributor to it
well i am  i am  a west texan lubbock midland odessa
what did you wind up with 
with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that is
yeah um i think about_n the only candidates that are out there that are you know anti antiwar on drugs or viv war on rights is uh pretty much your libertarian candidates which
i mean i have not seen it in a couple months but used to
and so he is used to a bigger size and because my brother is there
 i am  twenty six 
still do not seem to have gotten away from what we might kind of consider a more woman kind of business i call it like the three c is  like they are into cookies like mrs fields
someone did not file the proper paper at the proper time those are the things that have caused them to drag out i think
uh i work for a tire company modern tire and uh it is also a retreading plant and that is where most of our uh injuries occur
yes i
and uh everybody was used to him and they just loved him and what not and this his roommate put him out one day
yeah well neither one of them_n have them_n in a day care center right now but uh um my  my daughter that noise has  has three sons she is a
yeah there is a lot of action but i thought it was an excellent movie
and um is going to be uh entering north texas for uh a kinesiology program there
really not  interested  in  all  that
yeah yeah well ii have never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them and out there was a necessity i mean you do not kill a copperhead with a rock
and um i was not real happy when uh when they uh left to go go there of all places 
yeah and uh enjoyed it i ca not think of what the name of it was a uh of course one of the typical you know kicking fighting lots of blood and  guts  and  all  that type move and and we enjoyed that and uh
crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct
wei have had two schnauzers and before that we had all dachshunds and i think my husband wants another dachshund and we are trying to debate because our children are grown and and uh
well ii have been very happy with uh you know the
they have the gloves on the paws and they are they are usually two colored uh but this one is uh
uh and i would even encourage a liberal arts school with an engineering program but i tend to look i do not like what i see from the students who are graduating here with engineering degrees
uh back to the topic
why  why why do you think that it is less close than it used to be
um i have to i think one of the positive things
okay yeah well you just do you ca not help it is like it is like a kid
what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets
noise yeah because_n i  i work for myself and so uh
i bet that would be rather interesting uh
course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and steal  and sell it just because they ca not they ca not work anymore you know
biggest thing i find 
just let them_n go
 well i am  in graduate school now i noise i  i kind of feel like i wish i couldi have gone back to undergraduate  now   yeah
picking through them_n whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutors sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
so far fetched you know with the normal family life that uh but
do you think of colors at all when you
now i have not been there before i went to one i think in ohio or or or somewhere up there but ii have never been to that one here i know it is just down the street so now have you been to applebee is
yeah yeah and it is  it is interesting from the perspective of his perspective i guess
because it is a situation it is very location dependent
and they had not even they would hung the clothes out but they had not even pressed them_n so they did not look good to begin with and uh you know and they looked cheap and they were you know they were not cheap they were hundred and thirty nine hundred hundred and fifty
oh i guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies  because_n that is
well i guess mainly because um
you know maybe is a problem is uh i  i  i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does not work as well
i ca not remember his  name
have that well and it does not seem like very many people uh are really i mean there is a lot of people that are on death row but there is not very many people that actually um do get killed
open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems and uh ii have ii have really enjoyed that one since it came on
uh and those activities helped a lot in giving us things to do with the children
yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family noise was rather than have one child make that decision
yeah no we do not and i would not even i mean i do not even have cable i do not think it is worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay somebody to  uh you know give me a hundred and fifty um 
and you  the government is going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they are going to get it from us and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government we do not need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program
i do not really like that too well i keep telling my husband that our next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land 
uh i i execute on a three eighty six machine that is attached to the mainframe as a server  as a intelligent work station but i use it
and then you go to porsche and it is like well uh these cars are completely handmade and no two of them are alike
to adults and that type of thing that they have to answer to or even the criminals do in to the people that count the judges and that type of thing you know they they usually answer to them
and um it is really tough in the summer time mowing because we just have so much yard to to uh take care of
in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them_n out and
i think one the women uh in the work force and i think the fact that they are becoming uh more
 i do not know
and they are very very good at what they do
going uh five days a week
delicious no no the times ii have been out deer hunting i  i  i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa
ii have just recently had to start looking at it myself
identify themselves yeah
noise yeah i used to take that right
yeah i know that that is almost i mean that is absolutely unprecedented that was an an incredible foreign policy
yeah uh that that is partly my problem now is i do not have room for this i uh
i mean you know there is all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
yeah here a couple years ago my wife and i went to seattle on vacation
well they do have uh a major internal problem  everybody wants to defect and i can understand why um
probably ate all your merchandise too
well yeah  i really do enjoy it but i like i say i have not been for years we used  when after we got married a couple of years after we got married we got a boat and we used to fish a lot and including  you know we skied too but
uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life
jeez noise
