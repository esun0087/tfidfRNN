my uh son has a uh oh it is a real mixture it is part uh
and why i  i do not know i just do not see any i do not uh i do not see any importance at all in my vote in the you know in that in that even that smaller uh
now are at home without their mothers well or in some type of a day care or something because so many women work now
just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all  all the the grass that is being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff
the author of jonathan jonathan livingston seagull  seagull i ca not think of his name right now pardon me
that is the worst ii have ever heard
yeah yeah  somebody told me uh once the a casual conversation that this guy ran a a towing service
so it is just  we just have massive stuff that you know is we just accumulated too much stuff i mean not that we have a whole bunch of things it is just little junky you know old toys
um but what he is done is he is done a raised garden in the back yard because that we do not have dirt around here you understand that the  it is it is sludge it is it is mud it is cruddy
because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine
and uh iowa and
and uh i can over do it on her
and then i went to england
no no it is just uh
noise no
the midwest and uh it does not matter who they put in office they are going to fall subject to uh
yeah especially here in raleigh wei have got such little bitty bowling alleys
in his benefits like uh perhaps uh he has uh
you could record it you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you would heard or that you owned an album of so cds wo not be nearly as handy
ah what a shame
they keep you entertained they sure do we have a uh my wife is uh mother is uh oh about vocalized noise seventy seven i guess she really gets a thrill when we go over to see her and bring the dog i think she is more happy to see the dog than she is us 
it is um like seventy five miles from oakland and san francisco
i suppose but i had a hundred and twenty eight thousand on it when i sold it
income tax but then you pay  ten fifteen percent taxes um you know i know they say it is only eight and a quarter or whatever it is but uh but yeah i really think that it is it is way too much
that is what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you are not at work
if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had uh coming in uh were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would uh
i uh try to do what i can
exactly exactly
yeah actually they are from canada they are canada based
yeah it is true
yeah and i think dallas as far as um economic uncertainty is better than what most of the country is
and there is not anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful
my dad is got a new um i guess it is an eighty nine or ninety uh chrysler something or other it is one those transverse mounted v sixes front wheel drive
 oh listen i have friends in a lot of different cities if you would just fly me there i will take care of that
uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime
half the time well a couple of times ii have been interrupted by my little girl ii have had to hang up and stuff but i enjoy it i talked people from well carolina  well carolina now
he is eleven
has had a uh a similar volunteer program and they just got the department of public works to do a uh
it would really um and i do not  the people that ii have known like from germany and finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i do not exactly recommend but still
yeah well they are just so it is just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know they are they still talk about mister jefferson the you know i mean the founder of the school of course was mister jefferson  thomas jefferson and they and and a lot of
mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to
so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i am  making every effort to
that is amazing because i  if every child does that what are they going to do with all that
i will i will try to look at every day
i think they probably will you know if they i am  sure it is a very expensive program to administer
yeah no i think so too uh my wife just she keeps convincing me because_n my my parents uh my parents are dead now but my parents and my brothers and sisters always had dogs
do not have to
yeah an and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
generally i get most of my news from uh the radio and then sometimes um if ii have got time i will be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that i like
right i think we are all tired and having too many pressures and i just occurred when you mentioned principal it occurred to me when i was teaching how
uh i am  not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh california that on  on and off and on and off noise um
um she was not at all happy with it because was there was too many children per person
i think he went
i mean like kevin costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh huh that is the part they had trouble finding was wolves
and that is really that is really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know
the labs that are performing the test how adequate uh are those facilities and uh is is always it is it always a chance i know that what they call um the i think it is called the chain of custody
i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically
you know i think that may be part of it too they are not really informed
noise oh that is mine that is the only one i watch whenever i <b_aside> oh a small bowl would be better why because it is pretty fattening <e_aside>
i did you know i would not be caught dead like being out that late at night  in a dark parking lot  so
although there is still some still some problems but uh
but i do not know i  i  i do not want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs
it is a you know a noise
best for the whole uh kind of a thing uh does that make any sense or
i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian economy like south vietnam was that in reality uh the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes
noise oh yeah it is great uh just like um really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed
but i am  very interested in music anyway i play some stuff and i am  a radio dj and blah blah blah
no no because if you go back there then you can never get out
and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know hallmark commercials but i am  just that is just the end of me
i do not know what noise what  what is it is like there but here a lot of the country stuff is in you know lot of the woodwork a lot of uh stenciling
uh in the mount lebanon area
where out in the just kind of out in these little towns they would be in they may be the same kind of people you are talking about you know theyi have theyi have got twelve weeks to do something
it is i think it is a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh
noise and with  with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language and uh they are  they are going to the big cities it makes it very difficult
and uh day care and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in lubbock that do not make that much
um but it is such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i am  not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer
i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
because it looked so formidable um then then just
and my my first question is
and why did not it work last time  well yeah well i am 
i do not understand why we do not enforce the laws we have
noise yes yeah so
so a lot of times i would help her with that i have not had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately wei have been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going
that it is and they do not realize these things are going to affect everybody and if you are older it is not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends
i ca not ca not think of off hand of
slow down a little bit um hum
nowadays
but uh um the um the local taxes here i  i in  in this particular area um you know ii have uh i think i pay about uh oh
noise okay well the topic is selecting care for the elderly and i do not have elderly parents yet but not that far in the distant future what about yourself
um hum um hum
okay so uh
mild  mild say light weight lifting
he  he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from
oh and this is a club or uh do you belong to a group
i crocheted an afghan for our bed  that is  the  only  thing and and i did a quilt let is see ii have done a quilt for our baby and ii have done a quilt for our bed but i mean
but i am  doing all right getting over it
and uh so i did not get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to
exactly  exactly my um
um and uh
um be careful of strangers and and and 
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed
you know special corps of cadre of people that sort of thing and uh when the politics get real confusing
it would have been incredible i  i think of um you know all the social changes that were going on around that time
and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you are free to do that or not you are encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and
your time is is valuable and
so that youi have got got small small things to gripe about
yes the uh type of cars that i was uh uh i would probably be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh mazda miata
and well i do not  really do not need cnn i see enough bad news all the time  i  do not  need to see more of it so i ii have kind of uh
no not really i mean
is not that the truth 
but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and every now and then they would go and shoot their rifles and then they would come back and you know
i do not like that noise
they did uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we were not were not familiar with
uh yeah  i just have not found it equitable to work outside the home and so i have done the day care inside my home
right well you got weekends
i think a lot of people put themselves in the place  in the place of the person that has done the crime
uh have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
sure sure
it is hard to plan anything outside just because they show up
up to uh i guess the largest  largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible
area but you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns and um someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun
yeah i  i think uh there could be a lot of people  i think  people close this is really we are
huh what is that about
not at all
i think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than
i think we are overtaxed to the hilt noise
no but i do not think uh i do not think it is right for somebody to uh for me to to uh pay for something i mean the way  the way it is right now the prisons are overcrowded
yeah well it is it it is getting very expensive to run schools so they got computers now that you got to train on there is just so much uh more
so it kind of makes me dread going back to an american manufacturer
the rest look 
no we are west sevren is east near the eastern shore if i had
the the the justice system in the united states is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it
factors played a part in you know uh the everyone was
well yeah i do not i do not uh 
uh check kiting scam
uh coronaries cholesterol and chlorine
i um
 noise i understand that noise actually for a while we were taking like family handyman and thousand and one home ideas
the problem was that that she is a real hard worker and has started a a couple of businesses and now she is started a korean health food store and
yeah well the editorial page is pretty good of course they you know it is all things they get from other places
i am  originally from pennsylvania so
one
yes i i really think that um
but in terms of i well the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for uh certain crimes
or uh what what meryl haggard and faron young  that type of country western music is what what i like to listen to asleep at the wheel
so no they do not play and um
where where where do you have to drive to
go ahead
and it was  it was good um she she is not did not enjoy it much so i did not get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her but uh i thought it was real interesting
kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know it is very very easy to fall into that trap and i am  not um totally innocent of that because there is times when you just stay here watch a tape but um
uh should they ask well the french went in and tried their old style warfare and uh
inspect it and the kids want to swing and i push them on swing
you know my wife and you would probably love to go eat together yeah oh definitely well everytime  when we go someplace they have to have good french fries
education is given to them so
well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the bush administration has increased the uh funding for the peace corps
if they want it they will get it
so um
through bands through leadership uh there is all kinds of civic organizations  organizations that will give you you know one shot money
i can agree in local elections  elections which usually are on saturdays and i am  not too sure that is the best idea i think maybe you should have it
it is not like a mountain it would not be like a mountain it is uh
oh the one that uh harrison ford
oh absolutely that the choice would be yours
use a little more of it a little bit wiser and put a little more positive in some of their stories than complete negative all the time
no kidding oh well i did not know that yeah
yeah but the way society changes it makes it so that uh what was acceptable for our parents and their parents
uh guesswork uh because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like uh hepatitis and then
and he in fact he started with uh i guess uh well first generation computers
to go back and pick up that gun so that they can check them out
that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh
but if you are smoking
so it seems like one way or the other we are gonna end up paying for it
reader although ii have always liked sherlock holmes and then somebody turned me on to a guy named dick frances
noise you bet they tell you our topic hm youi have got it
absolutely
because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain 
yeah the greatest hits right  yeah
uh huh even at that age they need that time we all need that time
uh faculties that run the body your brain and your flesh and your bones and all of that and eating is a pleasure
and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level
we we were living in uh
yeah i am  not sure i  i  i kind of think i would like to go with uh something around a a one fifty i do not want a full size but i do not want uh one of those little uh mini trucks either
and i am  trying to think who it is that i was um going along with i do not remember now
yeah uh we are currently where i am  working now under blue cross
yes oh yeah that is already hurting yeah
yeah yeah we we bought this land out here we are going to we are going to retire on it
like you say it is uh five dollars an office visit and um my wife was in the hospital had our had our daughter and i think her total bill was around three hundred dollars
i like water i am  not scared of it but i could not i guess i could swim across the pool but i am  no swimmer per se
and uh i am  just in my lab and no one sees me then i am  probably okay
huh uh
now see usually when i was working at ti we hit about eight o'clock in the morning we all just vocalized noise what was news and coming up and all so we just 
finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home
yeah but  well you can tell i have not been in too many  juries  judges  chambers  or  anything  like  that  and well i was called once when i was nineteen and um
right uh it is it it is uh it is  instead of reporting the news uh it is more like an editorial i believe on a lot of issues
well that is a that is that is good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you did not have a lecture with  uh hall with about
i do want to go again we just moved to a new house  into a house so i do not see camping maybe in the backyard but i do not see going on a camping trip probably till next summer
and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor is not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i did not do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck if you have a little curiosity
oh that is neat
um
when they when they switch to switch when we get an hour more when they rollback an hour
mostly i just cook for myself
going that far now by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was trying to trying to get it but he was not there yet but you could tell
oh yeah oh yeah
from this seventy hour work person to somebody that goes god i am  ready get out of here you know i need to go to day care 
noise no it is not free but uh
oh okay uh
uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we do not do
right are you talking about outside or inside exterior yeah
so uh if you are near that age or you know somebody who is uh you know be aware of that
uh no oh ii have been up here about three uh we were down there uh from eighty six to
and it just threw him out of the whole running
one that was not total total patient care but where he could be watched but he had the freedom to wander around and and help
boys clubs girls clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and and i guess i do not see
uh i really do not have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and that is what i do everyday
and which uh you know which maybe does cause some problems that maybe other countries with more restrictive laws do not have but it is one of the prices that you have to pay for for freedom i think
believe you know i was from new york and so you know we rode the bus and if you had a car  yeah
i guess um looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh
oh we are too our community is uh just starting to get
but i did not realize that our garbage is not being decomposed that was a shocker to me
your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know but i am  sure that um
other than that that is the major problems ii have had i used to change my own oil and filter but i got tired of that so i let somebody else do it 
i think so uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i do not really feel that strongly about although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole i mean
to the ability of the individual to pay
i like the ihop there in plano
and besides when i go to the store i have a family you know i  i get maybe ten twelve bags of groceries and that would be a little  a little expensive although you know i am  sure some
yeah they have one character on there they just call it pat and they you do not know if it is a man or a  woman
you do run into  you do run into limitations on yours oh wow
right 
more i think it is more conducive to studying especially if you are like a freshman
yeah that that was  that was 
no it is it is pretty pervasive it kind of  goes into about all aspects of society i think up here
you know the suburb i am  in is more of the upper middle class so i think our uh not that we do not have a certain amount of local problems but on the other hand
that that its all a relative issue  issue everywhere  everywhere things do not work right and some places they really do not work right and here they they  pretty much work right you know
although i have absolutely no use for fully automatic weapon anyway
that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the the way they behave
through your pipes because it is toxic um chlorine it is toxic it is a i do not know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer
well very good
no they that is uh that is prohibited where we work although down here in texas uh you do have a right to to wear and carry arms with you at all times
i bet
oh how nice  i am  jealous 
real problem the last few days one of their uh young {hopely} stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season it was catcher
i  know well of course
what  uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh
oh my gosh
noise i know some elderly  unfortunately some elderly have to go to or noise have
uh those who made under a certain amount would not have  owe any taxes and then there would be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had
i am  sure of it because_n a lot of those things it is all it is in it is largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better
uh huh well um let is see there is there is one up at um see what is it just as um loop twelve turns into thirty five it merges it is right there it is sort of a restaurant row in dallas there
oh that is a good school yeah i know about that they do not have southern accents up there though
you do not have to shift 
so um do you want to discuss your recipe i have a recipe if you want  um it filled
and but he is was trying to make it in the sprinter is event and most of them are under twenty five
if these people uh are on drugs uh it does not the test results uh the results which they are
i graduated from texas tech more than two years ago i guarantee and you know i kind of look back at it sometimes well that was a lot of fun but well  you know i am  not sure that
you uh you mix up this little uh mixture of cranberries and sugar and a few nuts and
it is just i do not i do not know i just
um the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we are we are a really we are uh pampered up here
but once you get if you start  once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the audi parts are terribly expensive
yeah he plays sometimes at la madeline and um there is a couple other places that he is regular at and um yeah i really enjoy him
and it said you show me a country that can produce strong families and you will have a strong country
see i know is not that terrible i know i guess with that money who cares
for for local news i think we do real well where it is we live in a kind of small town
wait no no not not even the news but do they have like um
yeah you you go even a few wide  miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air
yeah i am  from indiana
handicapped societies type of places where they uh noise
oh yes you are not kidding
i am  a computer programmer on the ibm main frames noise i do uh main mainly business data processing
and on top that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a green beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry
but uh next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom
somehow i just think you know i like the idea 
well right they destroyed it 
and see if it corresponds up to what she is learning
it really is beautiful you will enjoy  i know she will enjoy it
a philosophy for oh i do not know probably the last you know twenty five years except for the last about five or six years uh they always went out and tried to draft the the best um athletes
yeah empowerment issue noise
hope it is a good program there
but i was i was trying to get my uh kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
and they will have all ten of those shown back to back in the middle of the  night for people can video tape them
probably built in the late fifties so it is not um what you would find uh
oh okay i never seen that
yeah oh wow  we like the stuff that glitters
of restaurants up there that i ca not even touch
worry a whole lot about where the funding was coming from so he would have that advantage
yeah just about everybody  ii have never had one but everybody i know who has they do not have too many complaints which is ca not be said about a lot of cars
a tougher rating which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public and a lot of times it is added for no real uh valid reason
oh yeah i agree with that
that uh if someone is from a foreign country
that is a big chunk out of someone is life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned 
noise so who is your favorite team
they just i do not you i do not really know about the a is i do not like the a is uh matter of fact i ca not stand the oakland  a is just because they have that you know theyi have got their
and um he is in the herman method of reading i do not know if you are familiar with that it is something new and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters
i  i well  i hope to see employer based you know helping out you know child uh care centers at the place of employment and and things like that that will help out
uh power figure you know competing against him and i think it is gonna be pretty close to his demise if he does not follow suit with yeltsin as far as uh realizing
as we do at movie theaters
uh is uh
i do think  yeah that is true i think in places i think in places like california people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off
uh it did not go through
maybe the you know there is no telling what the kurds did at some point in time
certainly a a supplemental way uh and i suppose if but  maybe in in your instance if if you are started with ti in your
but any way back to capital punishment i do believe in it for murderers and and especially um
um hum noise yeah well ii have seen that there is there is a lot of um you really have to appreciate their good qualities because there there are problems  yeah they leave a lot of hair around and
does not want to change
or was she from the young girl that uh contracted aids through her dentist allegedly and then they proved it yeah i do not i do not know um vocalized noise i do not know if it is the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what um
yeah yeah but everybody gets vacation i mean like uh ti and some other places you know they have social  recreational facilities and
so there is like a core of like each station has like two or four full time then everybody else is a volunteer
and they are saying  our texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the united states
 i at first i thought of food you know because_n that is what mainly what i  buy  it  seems  like and uh you know i still do not have any anything to do there but
uh no they i am  in telecommunications company and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know
noise i am  sorry um hobbies let me see i do not know if that took or not i will do it again noise
they consider a very serious benefit and i ca not tell you anybody right now at ti that is uh considering that
uh become well die or whatever i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that
um is when the kids get
right we have we have federal income tax state income tax local income tax we have state tax on gasoline um you know because_n our our so on top of the federal tax on gasoline we have state tax on gasoline so we are just
yeah i saw  i saw one of those episodes on pbs uh from time to time out here we have four different pbs channels that we can get on the cable
basically
uh i will probably stay with a foreign make ii have had real good luck with them
and we just we have separate garbage collections now for plastics and cans and newspaper and which i think is i mean that is that should be just a way of life for everybody you should not even complain about it you should just do it
so that is going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because_n a lot of times you know you do look at the men and they never seem to show any emotion they just
oh yeah yeah that was really uh really  i guess they may be about three feet long not four but um  um that was something they really fought like
maybe a third i still hand wrote because it would be like in the school parking lot or
and i know they have some really sophisticated equipment today where they do it electronically and all that but that takes money to buy those kind of tools too
so i do not but i could if i felt like it
and the girls kind of wanted something we have four  uh well now we have four girls when we got the fish to start with we had two or three but um
well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon
well i do not feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we
some people they say peru ca not be traveled to and the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
good education along the way maybe that is a benefit to everybody you know
and uh and uh that is is really a big waste because they did not they did not win they did not regain any of the land that they had it spilled over into uh now i ca not even think of the country but
and um you know look at some
by just going cash and like i say it was tough because it is a really it is a habit
it is been uh wet and wei have mowed our yard i think
and we would meet every thursday morning at our instructor is home because she did our firing for us
on a a periodic basis which noise which was impossible before yeah uh yeah it it it really has helped uh unfortunately um
i used to get that so now that i am  into dolls that is about
noise now we are ready  yeah i had a
um for myself i am  i am  personally against it but
the problem is with that is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so no one could even take off a day for pay you know pto um because they get penalized for it
hm well wei have had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh bangladesh  bangladesh boy they they caught it bad 
and we found out one day by mistake that lunch is about half as much as dinner is and you get about  almost the same amount
uh huh was not it your state that had the um guy that committed all those murders
costs a lot more or just as much to go to community college and you are not getting as much you know so
like give out a phony phone number
and like you say several pounds of this uh carbon black and uh material for for making roads and anymore there is a couple pounds of stainless steel
with it so i i can get a you know ii have already gotten a free trip just from using that card so i do not uh i do not have any carry over balances any more
uh no it was uh uh minnesota twins versus the atlanta braves
and i can research and go to the library and and discover who married who what year and all this sort of thing and come back and load it all into my computer and then when i want to
and these are the big mamas ie sons uh hewlett packards uh absorb uh oh the big solburns and it so forth
well theyi have already got uh oh jeez
what
uh the rapists uh murder type uh killers going around and
oh they can mess up your credit bad with it you know as far as your with your um
it it can be annoying and my other concern  concern is
that is the way i use them_n uh i try  i try to make sure i do not get in debt so
there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen o three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and then after that we started having the hearts attacks
i  i work for the government in washington
hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go american because everybody know has got a american made truck
noise well they vary tremendously
six and a three
you do not have a real favorite or
and of course so you can the lakers  so can you depend on the lakers for doing that
with a crowd of people it is uh it it it was kind of funny and we went in first and then it was so crowded and we went and i am  trying to think it is right off anyway i do not know if it is pizza hut or pizza inn anyway we went to another one and  and uh
well i am  uh i am  here ii have got just eleven years
wow okay
actually i feel noise that if we accepted these people
well i i drive like the song says the little old lady but uh but not from pasadena
exempt or nonexempt
sure sure that is right that is right
so they say that is really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things
with the topic vocalized noise i think i agree with you there needs to be more of an open policy
well i just think it is it is weird because ii have saw well of course soap operas i am  an soap opera fanatic this one guy had uh framed himself to make it where  which he really did kill the person but then he
if they knew that i came in there at all different hours
that was really called roughing it yeah
and some that sometimes that is coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so that is not so bad you know um you know it is kind of a give and take kind of thing i think
yeah and um noise by the way my other big pet here said he is gonna call you tonight  and
we do the same kind of things though wei have been concentrating on outside lately trying to do some gardening and uh planting a lot of trees and flowers
ii have uh changed wiper  wiper blades or something but i have noticed since uh i got married that my husband
it is pretty good training i think i mean it it keeps us on our toes 
uh right well we try  i mean it is a big mortgage in the sky and someday maybe we might even own it but um
and when they arrived where they were to have had celebrated new year is they found this baby dead and the bullet hole directly behind the driver is seat
judgment vocalized noise at once it is rendered guilty you know the sentencing is done by the judge noise in in a lot of the cases um some cases it is up to the jury but
and i think since being unemployed we look you look at things more carefully you know do i really need this or is it just something i want
let is see i think with like with rape it is one out of three women and one out of ten men or boys rape the the amount of rape and uh
yeah well i  i definetely  definitely advance that well listen i enjoyed speaking with you and let is hope some there are other people that feel the same way 
in one sense two forms of uh child care there is where individuals will
in fact we just had um a noise person put to death uh about_n three weeks ago was in in texas and i forget for the reason now oh it was for the uh that clergy that he murdered he murdered a uh
since theyi have become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders which is probably where yours came from people that do not know what they are doing and
noise well i do not know what to do about the federal budget um there certainly been ideas surfaced uh recently um matter of fact repeatedly by many people and i sort of wonder what your what thoughts you had on that area
no no no like that joe jose   cansego/canseco  you know i mean oh
noise okay
and so how do you relate as to whether this
there is a lot of places to camp around  around here where the they have rest rooms and showers and stuff like but the lake is really crowded so we normally go the mountains we found some nice little places in the mountains
uh never did get out and ski 
uh the judge is also sort of a jury
and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know theyi have got something maybe theyi have won something you know somebody sent them_n something free and go out and spend it
for instance uh i saw a thing on uh nova think was the other day this guy has designed
word text  word text processing so i do not i do not use vocalized noise i mean you can call it word processing but i do not usually use a word processor to do it
find  find is the
yeah it did not uh it did not have any real social bearing or
and i would never do that i never have done it and i just never would do it i would rather do without some things that really are not very important compared to being with my child when they are growing up so
i do not like greasy places
run the beat noise so in this heated air of mistrust people do not do what is necessary
not yet noise
you could time it just right
yeah but usually if i am  if i am  if i take a day off or on the weekend especially i try to cook real real food and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead so that we can
well that is something my husband is in construction and he wo not even touch electrical stuff he i  i mean he will do a little minimal things but he wo not do any major rewiring he says he would rather pay the electrician to handle it
yeah  yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be i am  sure your classes were a lot smaller um because_n like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number
oh yeah ii have owned uh several and built several uh
i think my husband is really glad about that 
uh huh right
yeah i mean you really you can do without one but after awhile you will start um you know i mean you just kind of all of sudden cause you are going well gee that you hear about something that somebody else talked about
no you ca not it is uh
because i was uh you know it is like when when you go buy fish you know like well like i buy like the fish that you can do in the microwave you know the breaded fish and you know ii have seen you know the filet
yeah that would be horrible
so when i drive the car in the in the driveway in the afternoon it it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the the uh pressure side of a uh hydraulic cylinder
to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas but i really do think that women have made a contribution
i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen
yeah many laws but little justice
well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods
um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh noise that is more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier
they wo not put up with that stuff
right
there is some one at the door so well i am  i am  going to listen we always
and what theyi have said is that we have not had a thirty three percent improvement in education
i do not
 thank you
vocalized noise it is worse the service is worse it really is than buying new because um people just do not know how to fix things now and yeah
it is just gotten so i mean
about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb
it is it is like the it is like oil on top of water it changes but it is never different in a lot of ways
and i was watching on tv they they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in jerusalem so we got all fearful
uh huh
do you think it is an economic crisis  necessity or do you think that we are we are uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
noise the  the only ones that i ever had were actually through the church where they had uh
is that right i am  into computers too i i am  a e d p auditor
all right
that is okay i am  bill from raleigh
well i do not know if i know anything or not but ii have ii have got some opinions on it see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at do not know anything
yeah  yeah yeah noise uh noise and um but i have been amazed and and in talking with uh some of my fellow students
no 
and felt like they were getting vocalized noise you know uh a good kind of experience as well
but we we have to wear white pants and um
during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but they are running under the assumption  you know
i mean you know if youi have got to drive it sixty miles a day you are gonna go through that car a heck of a lot faster than what we did i mean that is not something people think about is the car the car payments and the gas
yeah he is funny
is to be in a situation where you you get to know what is going on and maybe that is that is probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do
well we strayed a lot from music but i but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening so as long as you are listening so
oh yeah so just well mine is almost four
now is  is rochester where where is cornell university
you too bye
set to start all over
 and if they sell you well enough there ai not nothing that is going to change your mind 
well then the company is more profitable then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere
and they also provide towels and shower facilities and lockers and everything so
and uh every time uh my mother had uh uh i have two other sisters and my mother had us uh do some studying of the the area which we were going to visit and then we had to write uh
i know a doctor once told me it it a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
oh yeah uh huh some things we ca not do but but then we have not needed to either you know um but wei have been able to do what we can
the thing about gorbachev strikes me that he would not be that dumb  i do not know though
or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could
when i read about people in the paper that have gotten out when theyi have raped somebody or beat somebody or aggravated assault or whatever and they are out in you know a few weeks or a month or
sometimes my husband has a whole variety of music so i really have pretty much anything to choose from
i have not seen that one yet
oh you bet and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh
because it is something you were not forced to do 
and they have a job in jail and they work
in maryland yes
yeah like where does all the good stuff go yeah where is it i know they have to grow some of it
our beliefs
you know i think sometimes it is interesting we we really watch the big name players and but they have to have a solid team underneath or else they really do not do not go anywhere
well that is certainly true we can get hit uh a lot of corporations at least seem to get blindsided by taxes that are sometimes even retroactive which i would have thought was then unconstitutional noise but does not turn out to be
yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um
if you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can i mean a large flat plate hm
having an educated populace i mean the idea uh that uh you can make a sound judgment noise with respect to noise small votes in in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level uh
loosely
vocalized noise well their their own government or their own
so that that is kind of been the way ii have done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just cold blooded murder him and three other people and but still
yeah i think that is what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in mesquite who was out in six months
yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the kitchen wei have we had was um
was that it seemed to me that george bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that
oh do you sell them_n
to anybody to have done was on my wife is car um when we went in for inspection it did not it did not quite pass so we had to have uh that is uh that is a mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
here in central new york is uh hamilton college is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south
uh huh yeah noise i mean i go ahead um hum
bermuda seems to be yeah bermuda seems to do pretty good down here
semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch a person and and uh get him down but um
and i like the frugal gourmet
 and they grew up around you did not it 
to deal with on an  every  day  basis
or that what do they call it the nuclear family yeah but uh
um and it is uh
uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading telecom digest or was there another
myrtle beach i enjoy padre island right here in texas but i enjoy pretty much any beaches
uh huh it  it is not sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in uh that would have been about uh twenty years too um uh just last year and
yeah and that that is kind of handy yeah because_n if you do not see it you do not miss  it  and uh you do not spend it 
well of course working
that you see like in a newspaper
no it is for cooper industries
they are they are trying to reinstate it and the governor is opposed to it being that uh the democrat that he is uh mario cuomo
the last time i went camping was about uh in the middle of october
and um
it would get to the she was sentenced to jail but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced
part of our problem it is just that uh noise seems like these kids or older people that um
and so i need to make sure ii have got one that i can fit
it is like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill conductive  bond wire on on semiconductor devices
this is real interesting that you are as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we are
uh yeah yeah you just go and uh buy the gun and uh
and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons they both work all summer full time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
yeah yeah it uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie
it is uh that is interesting though
noise and mine looks real good 
uh they are not getting the benefits of being a democratic place but they they know what they are and uh the country tells them that you know this is what it is like to be a democracy and they are still hurting
well well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state
in the taxing system
um well to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business
yeah my husband is an only child too and he did miss it that is kind of why we got back after eighteen months 
and i guess i get some kinds of
in in a savings and loan  or own a or has a brother that owns yeah
people recognized dallas texas by the the texas uh the the cowboys and by that program
well i like uh i guess i like all kinds of movies but the ones i do not like are kind of like monty python that type of thing but
you know what i am  saying like that one where he goes to college
stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced mushrooms and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just bring it to a simmer
that is horrible
he literally jumped and he swears he did not do it and i felt him jump
yeah really no kidding
oprah
uh that is one thing ii have never really feared um noise uh i a lot of the my family
i  i think it should be it  it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy you  you  everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know uh but more than that every week uh youi have got to pay by the pound
uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad and it was a it was a traditional
i guess so  okay
yeah really
you need to stock up on batteries then
i mean we are on a private insurance plan right now uh actually uh i have my own business and and we uh our health insurance is through my wife is employer
uh possible and even popular to um noise criticize the government and they that pendulum started to swing um maybe  maybe even too far uh to the point where um
to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them_n i guess involved with community maybe you know just community activity if nothing else see how the city works stuff like that
yeah that is that and word processing is while i tend to i mean obviously i do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it is term papers or even some smaller homework assignments
and the uh the well i do not vocalized noise you are probably at least ten years younger then i am but i could tell you in school that uh the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was uh the one soap opera all my children and until then i would never paid attention to soap operas
of sour cream
um hum i like that
no he did not eat flies no they eat uh they greens uh we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know i would get lettuce at the store and he would eat the outside leaves
yeah is not that crazy i do not think he did do you
but in the valley north
uh huh well that is i think they need to have a a better
well same here
the area i work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so
and so we used to go camping my dad would take uh there is there was four of us kids we would he would take us and you know we would all go camping my dad and my mom and and the kids and
or they will know find out when they are performing and they will uh record the music at that time noise and so uh it is uh
yeah well it was a political move it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern
yeah well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because_n we just could not have him being so
yeah  yeah that is very curious
database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you ca not function
the uh civil war really picked up down there and us policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything that is
uh it it seems like we tend to be seem to be focused in on as long as it were equal and equitable it would be okay but uh how do you feel about whether it is something that the country needs or what the benefits would be
yeah that is one of the options but uh that is so related to the family situation of the children and
yeah we are not from texas either um
they uh we we used to have two papers here in town and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of
 anyway i do not know i just
kind of whining or whatever on it i  i  did  i really did not think it was it was that way i think it had some some good uh
my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um even as a child i got to go
or mothers to children you know because they are able to spend some time
so we are  somehow we are better off than a lot of them_n
that it is fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing but it is it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the go saturn
well like what tell me
yes it it on nights when it was already really late and i would try to short circuit it it was no no no 
noise um not that old three or four years old maybe and uh he he really enjoys it so
oh you are right i have not 
and they they pay him as a consultant but he does not get any health benefits he does not get well we do not care about retirement benefits he does not get um vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that
okay ann richards is our governor in texas and she is really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes and uh my sister is real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing
uh huh okay i guess i do not
which that is a lot of fun um so we try to ride  ride during the week to stay in shape for that
anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for forty dollars
yeah
i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like yeah vocalized noise
with her toys and her food and everything and and not one mess does she make and then we go outside
so i have to hang these things high so they ca not get to them especially the catnip
oh and pour that over it that sounds great it would be pretty
and uh i am  i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but
a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding
oh great
oh that is terrible
noise and those are going away
yeah it is something i it is like uh i am  young and i should get started getting into shape i do not want to at one i mean one point it is going to be too late to do it like
all these people were and  and it was on one of those kind of shows like nn/nn these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord
well
yeah it and it is fun for me to do that it is it is something i enjoy doing it is funny though it is like i do not really want to cook for us  it is kind of like when you are a kid and and someone else is house was fun to clean but you did not want to do your own 
was it like a primer
but that  it it exists is what i am  saying those avenues exist
they have not been that good this year um we are supposed to talk about television let is stay on   i do not have a tv
was her show big when you were in college since you have not been out that long was it
our new car they had a thing going with oldsmobile and if you would buy a a new oldsmobile they would give you four hundred dollar rebate because it was their seventy fifth anniversary
i really do not think so yeah i really do not because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent
um i know ii have seen the sign somewhere yeah
well i i i was uh it was favorable i i just uh i think the sanctions would have worked uh but it would have taken longer and uh now with all this stuff coming out with woodward is book and everything uh
yeah yeah that is just it
yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i do not have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but uh this this was actually inner city
what college are you teaching at 
i got the first of a set of master is degrees and four years after that i got another master is degree
right which is probably pretty nice but i will bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
um hum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i am  i am  probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that uh
that uh you are not being  picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you got to i
um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just wo not
you know i mean you are gonna have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how
like a radio show just like the old days you know it was like from the old days and i was thinking gosh that is i mean because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and you do not understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it and it is i mean you know it is just too bad that everybody has everything fed to them
did not have the you know the money they said it is a good way of uh in  coming in but those are public service i mean you i mean you would be getting paid very little you know or anything at all
 okay well who you know do you have uh a lot of kosher foods there at your house
yeah course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because_n i was selling it i was not buying you know just to hold onto it
like reagan of course before that you know he was in westerns all that  all that time and and uh he was real gung ho and then noise then just now
have you ever been sport fishing
planted a garden some things like collard greens and cabbage
going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we are on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although
um i have played golf in the past i am  not very good at it even though i am  pretty well sports minded um there is something about holding that club in my hand that i want to hold it like a baseball bat
uh but now i find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a um word processing system and a communication system
especially in uh big government federal government uh where we are  we are short changed
um hum right that is real important i believe so too to meet the and administrators as well and really kind of
you know i make more than my boss noise
fortunately i was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked
but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know
oh that is too bad because
um personally i when i when we were growing up and when we were uh going camping i thought that was little too structured of a camp ground
 yeah probably so
that that is not that much i mean you know those are not i
and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it
well i think it is i think it is toward ann arbor so it is
harder than my uh like ligaments and all that should have been  allowed to and so i was always throwing my arm out and uh
and so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed and all these i think are very important parts of them growing up so we
no i can drive it all it is just me so i can make it i am  thirty five
yeah it is it is you know some  uh some of the stuff i do not i do not feel the need
and how we uh interact with one another
you take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco shell and you uh for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there is well i had an occasion for my uh mother in law who
well i think we are about done okay uh good bye
and in order to uh resolve it before it happens that they feel that this is most  the most direct way and
uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i  i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids
oh my word
oh uh that is interesting you said computer networks um what uh what sort i am  fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that is interesting
for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves i think it is uh would everyone  everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country is all about
right right yeah it is all taken care
but where we camp there there is a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk
there is noise should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty you killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever this is what is going to happen
i said you probably have some friends that have television 
there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without
do not want to or do not have the time
for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment
uh yes i do as far as uh
well it is like vocalized noise well  the one that i worked in um you would see some of them_n noise uh just
and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed
oh golly numerous uh application presentations uh memos uh uh spreadsheets um
oh it is fabulous really you should never miss that it they are just gems of shows i mean they are really uh fabulous in every way 
well actually i ii have known how to sail pretty much my whole life um my  my family is pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six and then uh noise
well that is interesting yeah i know that um wei have done some other things with the grass and trying to
oh oh oh i am  sorry oh i am  sorry i thought you were talking about a kind of food like  red lobster yes them the red  chain yes thank you never mind 
 did you have to listen to long stories about how on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way  those are it is hard for me to  act nice about that when he goes on and on 
or whatever we used to run to red  you know red lobster but now theyi have got one in killeen  so  we  do not  have  to  run  that  far so that is that is about how things are and the seems like the market here is picking up yeah i really think it is
um you know if the teachers have um their master is degree in in child education and um child development um you know what what kind of a structure is  is it going to be um
and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty and
uh the what about you
oh yeah pappasito is we went there on my birthday in march it is great
and i would say well at this point um you could say been through all that because i have no no grandparents left uh and it is
well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable
oh no
oh you found that out tonight i had not even heard that that is great i think he deserves every penny of it
well i  i guess in one sense we felt that it it is nice to have a dog
so there is more of them getting killed than the whites
oh and it yeah  well correct  that is correct yes yeah if if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is it is executed yes
uh university of texas in dallas yeah
yes it is now we have not watched any of those
well i do not know if uh vocalized noise you mean they keep the children they want the teachers to keep the children longer
but and i you know what i mean i  they were right next to us and it was obvious that they did not know and so and he ate it all before they got back and everything and so
i it is it is a different perspective on everything too i i know well whenever they talk about uh
of the you know the whole situation and it is a decision that my parents have made and it wo not be a drain on our resources because it will mean just
well i did watch it just to see what it was and was not  it was not really that great so i think after a while they just kind of you know there is no new stuff they can do theyi have done everything dirty in the book you know so
kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings
sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his his attitude is i think a little bit
yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we are going to hire new people you know
okay i think i did know that
it was pretty much it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old volvo
well my car is uh it is an eighty six and i really had not had any any trouble with it until  until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something
when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and and it was a dog that we gotten
yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who is telling the truth you could  between the channels there was
they uh carried her
right so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting
really  yeah i had not thought about that um hum
and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspirational  inspired you know and uh
and uh austin is neat for for an occasional visit
  yeah pretty funny
so that then students could watch that and uh criticize the methods used and and analyze it figure out what worked and what did not work
and uh does a lot of of work with them
first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that it needs to be done you know
you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them_n probably will have cds players by then but uh i am  not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off  so i am  going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until
and what it takes to have that good life and  if you are willing to work for it then they are probably be more inclined to work for it
not my degree
i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage
two or three novels a week
it is quite they say that the green glass now that there is a big glut
um although i work in in sort of hi tech industry type thing and and and which in large part survives on on uh on defense contracting you know so
well it it is uh when you look at the uh you know route seventy five coming down there i i mean it is actually a bridge but it is a bridge over top of roadway there is no water there i mean uh
yeah my uh mother in law is into the corn bread stuffing now i never really had that much
yeah it it looked fun i am  like oh i wanna learn now 
but there is so many more people exactly that you do not even and that you do not even see or know about
that
one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the gulf conflict
so it was an hour you know
oh yeah so they have a toehold a good toehold
with all the um cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain
well they um i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago
you know deducted for an hmo
but now out here in texas where i am now that is very unusual
that things ought to get better so uh and  the other two all  oh they are all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in anyways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to
oh i we like uh uh for the cajun the spicy we like atchafalaya is out on beltline in addison and it is a good restaurant
you know it does not require  a  lot of thinking and sometimes after ii have worked all day and have things to do at night
oh okay so so they can get like the doors and led zeppelin yeah that is cool and how about_n the rolling stones
noise it is something that anyone can watch and enjoy
oh i see well and it is successful the way they are running it so ca not knock it
right right
doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing um i like to read  the magazines i to read  like  i like to read readers' digest i read a lot of bicycling magazines
but it does yeah it is kind of like making a comeback it is just cyclical and just kind of making a comeback now i guess and that is what they enjoy hearing
it is basically anything that is south of downtown they do not bother to cover
noise yeah i finally served on one last year ii have um been voting for years and i could not figure out why i had not been called yet
yeah he was doing well and the kid from houston they drafted from houston uh they gave all that money to
well that is right because that is just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have uh have to have that for farming  and they do not look at it so much as you know
um but you know there is some things you do not really think about looking at in a pre owned home that that you do in a new home so
okay
i got called but i uh never uh got selected for a jury i sat for twelve  ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process and they had
 oh  my  god yeah youi have got about another six months and then you will get one
you know i had a real problem with that
so we had a nice thing going there and it was delicious  i really enjoyed that and then i also have a a garden oh it is probably uh
noise pay for paper
that it really does not  save  you any money if it is a money thing and as a deterrent thing i do not really think uh personally i do not feel that capital punishment  punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal i do not think that really works that much
what age would you say uh a child should be before you could start applying this business of teaching them_n a little bit preschool information we talking  what six or seven or four or five
they are liable to tear up my membership
yeah yeah they have a state income tax in maryland but i noticed when i was in the in the
so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work and he is actually in child care in a preschool not
it was all metric and
because_n i wish we would do more noise at work we started
and you know but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion is share and the rest of it is split with the rest with everybody in the group
so we are we are starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement but with not a whole lot of discretionary money it is kind of hard to figure out how to do it
oh i am  thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars
more than it is worth
and uh the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what  i  understand
are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and
well do do you watch music television mtv at all or vhn
why did i pick music
i do not remember the name of it but that was so good
not um i wonder sometimes  um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife is boss a couple weeks ago and um
well i do not think he would have been i think that his his type of crime i do not i do not think he would have been i think a street criminal would be you know like what you find in washington dc
dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that theyi have had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know they will wear it with a nice top and and uh
ooh how nice
yeah any any um noncolored  noncolored or {nonfilm} type paper just white paper and that sort of thing
yeah ii have been with them for about four years now
i do not blame you well 
you know does change fast and things do happen severely a few times a year but there is an awful lot of good weather too in between
oh well do they have good job benefits
it was like another world
that will
my husband and i were on nutrisystem about eighteen months ago and he lost sixty two pounds and i lost twenty one
yes right and what you would want done right yeah
well we uh
federal guaranty program
well the wr grace uh was put in charge of a commission to find government waste uh this is about eight or ten years ago now and he came out with a whole book
uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you do not really have much control over
what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or
does not seem quite fair does it because_n they have the money to shelter things and i do not know somehow get a huh
no
so i got over there and she said oh that is too bad the dog has already been sold and i did not realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room
i guess uh
i do not know if it is really quite hit him hit them  uh i have two girls and they they just been real um
i do not know ii have enjoyed a lot of his movies uh they just uh they are action filled and they are a little bit of humor and
and we started mowing our own lawn because they were doing that and so anyways we have a nice full tree now and and we put our we usually fill it with lights and that kind of thing
would uh pass the inspection a seventy six and
we try and it it we really enjoy it we are having a having a good time although can be rather frustrating  how about_n you
uh huh yeah i do not know how you combat that i i do not know where you start or with a lot of these kids um
uh yeah they had not  i do not think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um ii have ii have got three kids who collect football cards
um in one bathroom it is um it is probably paper uh it is silver silver and yellow and  white
they will eat fish she will eat fish
but uh they  they  they were fun they were real
five
seems like we do get a lot of rain but i guess not i guess it does not accumulate too much
well i think we are about to run out of our time
in that respect yeah
and it is really not hard i was surprised at how very easy it was i think most people just uh
yeah they do it is what about_n two dollars a pack now
is  but  is it also legal
oh yeah but you yeah you can just buy now the one i am  buying is a used one which i do not get till december so people will be using it until december but i got it for nine bucks so
the and nothing seems to change and uh i am  not sure that anything will because these vocalized noise if something could happen to make these people not wanna buy it
and do um work in the national parks and work in uh neighborhoods to do um clean up and that sort of thing but i do not know
but because it was he had an affair
you know as people change their attitudes that is gonna make the biggest difference women uh participating as equal partners
so what do you think about it
well uh he uh  boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief they they say it is what makes him happy is to give us daders grief so i can believe it
and so i see i little bit of that and i always wish there was a balance you know with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids and the other gal  i  wish  she  could  just  get  out  of  dodge  for  a  while  and  get  some  peace  and  quiet
you know you go there you train you get treated like shit and then you you i mean then you get out
um um particularly uh in this part of the country where  um i guess
i have some yes some children i have three boys and they are all quite young and so we want to plan for their education we are  we are saving right now and we are getting
i do too i oh i think that is awful
um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month  they are coming out with something new and so then you are not compatible  oh yeah
that is correct i have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore
sam samantha
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless
right  right it is the same thing with the news magazines like time and and the other magazines it is hard to celebrate  uh to celebrate to separate
not getting to go uh just uh the distance involved and uh just not
with my dad is uh health plan at his where he works but
i would i would agree with that they almost  even more
well the the thing that i am  wondering about is how we get a new congress how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them_n
well because_n these guys if they um give us a hard time we are going to say you look you know if you  if you ca not fix this to our satisfaction we are just returning the computer
and his family is down here we are out of the service now but yeah he got out of it his unit right after panama we went to panama  he went to panama when noriega was doing all that
i i do not 
a well perceived war world wide this was it
we do not need anymore
oh gosh is not that awful  that would be awful um yeah we are lucky to live in the united states there is no doubt about it
noise i do not know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it service merchandise
somewhat yeah yeah
i think they are very difficult group to integrate into uh society they are very difficult um group to find jobs and uh and uh places for
uh murphy brown uh designing women that ilk
and i mean i know they there must have used been computers or something for animation this day but it was just
no not in not in texas  not well not in dallas that is
you know i mean i  i find that really {offencing} or offensive
yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy
all the fun things that that make memories
no no i i can maybe eat some jalapenos but i really do not you know ask for those on there i am  more like into the enchiladas and and stuff like that but no i do not really like it hot
my my husband is yes we use my husband is but  he he works for bramalea company and they pay one hundred percent
that is true unless it is a large corporation that has a lot of different branches uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that
wherever there are more
good point wei have got enough without leave  without a passport there is plenty
i do not know if manners is a is a good term or not but you know dealing with other through uh
twelve and sixteen
the one you put on top the burners beat out with the hammer
um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh switzerland opened up a um uh a park
yeah about_n an hour about_n an hour south of tampa
 how do we usually on the grill we will take the back strap and soak it in italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill and it is good
me  me too  you are really roughing it 
we go where the work is
 where do you work at
right right  ii have been uh i tend to i try to catch that every now and then and i mean you still catch up with it you know every couple of weeks
in all of wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
capital cases like maybe the death penalty
i do not know
something similar to that but it does not have the specific stitches anyway it is a little bit more loose and not uh quite as structured and i like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that
yeah i
no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like just waco  like i live in waco it is a large city i can still function in my own kind of
you know with all the uh ussr is satellites breaking off and trying to become independent and then you know european community coming together
eventually
uh and so it is an external modem i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it uh quite a bit when i was um
money seems to be too big of an issue with  with with with with with what is going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be
it is funny that uh i guess all that started in england i guess all the measurement  system of measurement and now uh we are still using it and they are gone theyi have left it you  know they use metrics there
it was good but i mean he was
a quality home even the homes that i see that are that they are building out in north dallas where they are paying
noise oh those are they are about uh uh thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on but noise
no that is kind of a a bummer i am  looking forward to the time when uh my phone at home can tell me who is calling
my spare time usually noise involves something with the kids yeah  you know hobbies we i  i ca not really say that we have hobbies it is more like maybe
it is just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that is going through
oh good grief
finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else
and since i am not a tennis player um you know i do not get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there are not many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers
and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because_n apparently he would bought uh he and four other people from honeywell had bought a seat or a row of seats actually
it looks really really cute
i think it is a trend that is that is that is uh probably may go nationwide eventually because_n i think national health is something that we all need it is getting to a point that
and they had misclassified the sex of the  the  uh rat there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the size of a mouse
wei have actually got a kind of a nice set up wei have got a
i do not know noise yeah think it was
noise reasonable construction would probably run you uh
and it was pretty fascinating we we learned how to do how to make a brochure type thing out out  off  off the computer so it was pretty interesting
well i was about to kill and dismember this person but ooh if they catch me they are going to kill me so i better not do it i i just do not think that uh that it works that way
that is right
they yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals and right what they were going to say and the american people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that so they were they were playing it very safe but
yeah well it is kind of ironic they are also  these days they are trying they are working their way back into the house
uh it is i think it would be good for them uh it helps mature them a little bit and helps them understand the world the way it really is
a capital is capital punishment
are not  not having the same success i think some people have just assumed well why why ca not you be successful the japanese were or the chinese were or something and it is really much more complicated
a pop up trailer huh how fun we have a tent
and do my chores around the house
oh my god what a terrible thing for her to go through
it is like a smokey flavor if youi have ever you know had stuff like that yeah it is totally different sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the middle eastern cooking so
yeah i tell you what the first three days i was glued to the television
afterwards i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean you are talking about the person is already been found guilty
somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the baltic states
yeah i  i would say you know the  almost everyone and uh except  except me except myself and you know my husband but um
well you are single and you know
because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them_n
but uh i uh
is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just  just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue that is being lost um and i  i do not know if i agree with that but it but 
right right
well because of its colonial you know background and then of course during the civil war  or during prior and during the civil war it was a border state you know with half the state northern  northern and half the state southern you know in sentiment and so forth
oh man
you know where you know you would hear what is one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in baltimore but in salisbury you would  that is all you would hear was this is the doors you know so was sort of a funny thing
my my wife has been working with them
that is good that is a fortunate  that is a fortunate benefit you know that they are so active for their employees
y'all were not getting any of the strings of uh the tornadoes and stuff were you
noise i guess we are being  recorded what do you have any hobbies that you like to do
well it has been that way for a very very long time though i can remember when i was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago we were reading about the french struggling with that in southeast asia
i think if if any of these boys want to do it they really can if that is really their dream
the  the  my favorite is
disposal is a problem
noise well i have not had an awful lot of uh incidents in regarding child care when my two year old was in new orleans she got bit on the cheek and uh but uh that is about the the uh the extent of it
oh
uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of it is poverty whether it is the people are not trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that is another story but uh uh it is sad there there is so much down in all of south america
but if you let them_n yeah if you let them_n in a million at a time it would not make that you know it would not make that big a bulge in the population but politically  politically and economically
my first three cars were uh seventy model pontiacs a gto and a bonneville and a station wagon and
but uh yeah i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos i like watching that kind of thing it is
it was it was annoying one one half of the starter was  you know three bolts on the starter and two of them were
okay china cry was basically the the true story written by this this lady who had uh
i was actually quite surprised i went to uh san francisco recently uh to berkeley and and uh
uh huh she likes to do that
i just i am  rather puzzled about the whole thing 
until you leave you are you are competing against somebody else or you are competing against uh a system or or something you know and then
but they i do not hear much about it down here course texas we do not have a bunch of vocalized noise pollution but too wei have got that air coming in off the coast and you know it would blow it up north
when did you live there
uh huh
well that almighty dollar
i know i was just like god set this up for me he  knew i needed this and uh noise so since october then theyi have been going there and
well there is two kinds one i guess i would say is with my wife where we enjoy uh
uh huh
okay um officially a junior right now um
okay you lay this down we will lay this down but that does not mean we we are not we are going to stop watching you and making sure you are not
yeah i guess you would say jr is vocalized noise working and going to school  trying to go to school
three years or so you pay the unit off or whatever
uh attitude you know and what we are really getting into and and the fact that that that war you know coalition forces stuck together uh and uh
the uh
people yeah
well all they are there to sell you know or to entertain even worse and uh not to transmit information
yeah around fifty percent
right i agree
yeah going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
and i guess we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that
i do not yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children uh and even those who may not do it seem to be
problems being a mister nice guy and i think that is what he was and is you know i i think he tried to
and they were not dropping dead of heart attacks and
someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period but uh i  i guess the uh nra they kind of look at it as a springboard towards more restrictive gun controls and
the home improvements
and her husband made her stop  after she got married her husband made her stop so so now she is just like
sat at our table every meal was from london and they had never been to the united states so they were really enjoying it and they were telling us about all their trips
okay let me think if i have rented that one harrison ford and how does the story line go
which got people really going into it but
regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good
so that sounds great well uh we also have five children
it has got gay  oh they come in all different colors the blooms are on some of them is yellow purple white just all different colors
do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let is say ten twenty years ago
and i have have done uh gone to work for american heart and just recently for the leukemia society
oh that sounds marvelous  now do you work outside of the home
um one or another of the boys in uh child care for part time  just for part of the day
uh what does what does that mean alternate
too much restriction on the uh on the orientals also
uh yeah
yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff are not really concerned with your first two years anyway it is it is your core education your general requirements  general education requirements um
and they want to do the research and uh they are all noise
forty five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty  five  minutes
oh i do not think we did really either
that is true maybe that is a way
but uh the cubic feet per minute of air flow is up to ninety and so that is what
the seats are not real soft and comfortable and there is only so many positions you can get in and your body gets tired plus you hear the road  road noise a lot
you know for women to be more accepted  you know accepted into those kinds of areas and to have progressed education and {experiencewise} i mean
right they just want to see how close the  electoral  votes are with the public votes
yeah well that is that is that is the same manufacturer and stuff  so they just market them_n but uh yeah those are and those are supposed to be
wei have been wei have been uh writing a story together and so i and i wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it you know
yeah i am  thirty two so uh i barely  well i missed it seventy four is when we quit sending troops over 
and she said i just at night time i think boy i do not think ii have had anything eat today
i hated that when i was in high school playing football coach was always making us run
and vocalized noise we would go out and not even lock our doors
and uh my mother has subscribed too the reason i get uh the
yeah i figured for noise and theyi have just raised the
i am  not sure executing them uh
but uh there is other authors also that have uh
some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta with  and some cool whip
uh actually i am  a big chicago bears fan real big and um i always watch them so what no matter who is on of course you like them too right do you
yeah it is amazing what a minivan can do we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan and pulled uh um the little trailer behind the pop up trailer and uh it is so it is really amazing how much a minivan can  can  you know what it can do
oh yeah it is expensive stuff and
oh great
yeah for me i think that drug testing just it  it follows the path that society is going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs
wei have uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa
uh go ahead you you comment on it yeah i am  glad that you are in the business that i know ti is gotten it with their speak and spell and everything ii have told my wife that one of the reasons they are doing it is because eventually you will be able to talk to your computer you would not have to have a keyboard
you have to have it you have to have some form of health insurance
yeah well i do not either unfortunately i do not have to work in those companies  but uh i  i uh
and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there
but it is really it is a very nice place uh i i would cheerfully live there at you know of course it is not my home
to let them_n go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything and noise
i i am  awfully sorry that the mavericks ca not come on and and do roy who is your next best team or who do you like after the mavericks
yeah there is twelve troy ounces to the pound
noise me think a political event that happened this year
in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be
uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution
um hum sure sure
oh it is like his first name is like marlo  marlo or marlin
um part of this i suppose is justified in in  in that the climate they do not need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the  the more northern territories need
yeah really
and how about the and how about the person in uh houston
people i do not know it is so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long
uh my children well now we did not uh they did not go to school until uh uh junior high but they were in sherman texas
but does it have uh like a disk drive
um got a green card is and is in good standing in america and in china but only because he was always pretty nice to the chinese government
vocalized noise to an extent that is really important you know that that um it is important for women  women who need to work uh or are in a position that they want to
i know i am  a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes so i am  not i am  uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that
um and then there is another one out let me see off of one twenty one coming up pretty soon so i like to watch things that are close uh by to see if there is any names that are familiar with texas
i think it is more fun to play than it is to watch
and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be sitting at different levels
they do not pay anything on uh implants or transplants
so that is that is a little rough you know we are not we are not quite up to that sort of thing
yeah well you know i as i said i teach school and
china and figurines and statues and stuff and um there is some stuff that is really for uh auto repair it is called j b weld
uh right uh and no it seems that a lot of people a lot of christians seem to sort of walk the line between uh
yeah uh huh yeah their home just burned down as matter of fact and um last summer and they are just rebuilding and um their house is going to be really big  they are
is it a cockatoo what is that one that is white
and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it is not
i had not heard that
or it can be
and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so
 do you know that i do not follow performers i do not follow actors some i know some i do not um
twilight zone rules man twilight zone rules
uh i was not with gsi but i was connected with uh
uh but it is almost impossible uh you  you know what  what really aggravates me is it is impossible  it is impossible i am  in graduate school and they set the court date on a wednesday so to go from dallas to denver uh to fight a ticket
because everything there is six flags right by the stadium there is a wet'n wild uh and it you know that is all the tourists come there and
so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house 
i heard that the topic today was gardening and lawn care
you youi have got to be in a country even in in mexico you do not see things thrown away like we do here
you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but
you know why would they do that
a chevy um citation
that is good uh what kind of things do you do
oh me to boy i have to hunt  hunt them down 
that i had not written down so i had recorded that but you ca not find that in the newspaper
some how i got a hold of
well that is how the show that is how the show ended it just left you hanging there like you know like you set me up you fed me all this information  information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and
well i have to agree with that you know i was thinking about um importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent
you know that second group of people falls into the the group that i say give up their rights the the first guy
yeah it so fun  much fun to talk to you
uh huh it is on about uh twenty two inch piers something like that
and throw it out the at the and at uh
i really think that um
uh huh yeah me too um noise if it was really  it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots but then i would change um into heels as soon as i got to my desk so um
area to have them_n but for instance you can see in russia especially now there is a lot of hard liners coming back because_n the  the economic reforms are not working we could find ourselves right back in the same position again
and you just end up doing it but if you have not been married that long you know you are doing other things  
i like your governor
uh the networks got sort of ridiculous with they they they felt like they had to interrupt normal programming for all this but they did not have anything to say
powerful enough  right right
that is so strange noise
yeah the the the media was more mobilized than the military was i think
but uh but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
yeah that seems to be true um yeah if youi have ever been to like new york city and
yeah like a honda or uh a toyota fifty thousand is just getting broken in for them
okay well
my voice you mean oh no that is just because ii have moved around and
taking your name from lists
uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area
some real um
which we do not have down here but uh
yeah then you just ca not get better
imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know it is like  jesus christ
i have not seen that much  change  you  know  what  i  mean  i am  kind of young  still i do not know what how much it changed in the last
 yeah in the it just sets the
how did i get into it oh i am  uh electrical engineer uh here in virginia
oh where do you go to college
well sort  sort of we are probably like most american   american  families i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much wei have got at the end of the month and we know what bills have to be paid
kind of gives them_n the vocalized noise you know like noise get a little leery of the real small ones noise that they do not get much interaction with kids but uh
yeah all the doctors here will take a visa so that and you know and go to kmart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back
okay thank you bye bye
um no i did not
do not ever ever consider
and that is what i say you will  you will be  you will be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it is because youi have been there
you know her skills were as needed as the man is to you know to like establish a farm from the beginning
well uh maybe it was the area i was in but a lot of schools had lot of transient um families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side and
oh is it ten minutes
make sure it is a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
so we like it where we are at if it is not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff
 i had one from somebody that was up in new york and they were out of their house because of the ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and
but um the guys seem to get to have to dress up a little more than the girls
sometimes the noise and observer uh it depends it it is it has decent national coverage but has an extremely
and it last  it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and it  it is a matter tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not
it was an age where it was uh we thought it was be good for them to have the noise discipline that goes with with having a pet uh
most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that if somebody really needs that time
if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so really they do not ever huh
but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex athlete is daughter somewhere in florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive
my love was not there for the game  i liked to as a as a method of uh entertainment and i uh fellowship but uh outside of that no i did not and i and i still i like to bowl but uh
that is right
what i ca not understand is
oh yeah uh huh as a matter of fact that is what i am  doing um hum it sure is it sure is
oh absolutely absolutely
yeah i really do
yeah they leave they leave some songs with you they leave i do not know what it is
yeah how did you like africa
right noise we that is been an a an issue uh
and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those  all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule
well let is see  reagan obviously was not too concerned with the domestic side of of of uh his political affairs uh and i think bush is kind of followed suit um
to do uh spreadsheet analysis for various uh businesses that we are studying and also uh you know it hooks up to normal printers and what have you and uh works pretty well in that mode as well
also i noise not convinced that the at least the kind of people that i work with i am  not convinced that that is really uh doing much for the program  for the uh drug problem
i think they are looking after their own
yeah  right yeah he maims them_n pretty good does not he
i think you could not make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater but um
and i believe in this but
that might be more well to well off you know going to a private catholic school or whatever uh and and they are not all that way but you know some that are um
and okay uh let is see well who do you like from that category yeah say
and looked at somebody says you know i think i liked that  and then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought you know i did like  it 
and uh we had a review today and a few things we had to do that noise
i mean uh i build a uh i have a stock english garden bench which i make
and then it bakes  during the summer and the backyard is great because we get all the southerly winds back there and so they are not blowing as hard and uh then we get the eastern sun so the backyard is great for growing stuff
i am  trying to think what else is on i know it is like
i am  trying 
i used to play three which was the clarinet but ii have that is since  gone  into disuse
so at at any rate this is getting off the topic but it  my my point was that there is for people who do not want to do the military service there
does it say something
and now it is very slow and i pretty much ii have taken a couple courses and now  now i sit at my desk and i and i read read my courses
i think i think that idea is even even more common in western europe
i like it and what ii have been thinking about doing is volunteering for this uh asian center that a doctor falk has started that works with the school district and doing what
there is always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else
uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now
noise i am  not real sure about that  do you know anything about ruben sierra is uh
yes
yeah i guess so huh
and to me that is more important
yeah and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are american citizens then
oh really
okay so we are in garland
so what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution
sort of you know they just died of something um but the  my grandmother  my grandmother is case which is very sad she fell she came into new york to visit and she fell at the airport going down some steps and spent you know six months in the hospital but it is was still it it was  it was not
noise my children all have been grown for a couple years and we were using it less and less and less so
excuse me jim could you hold on i have someone at the door i will be right back
that one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water you know like hundreds of gallons of water
oh yeah i am  a nurse and and i work float and so i work lots of days and lots of hours and different times and so
well i guess i would
and then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm and into that same skillet add the juice of lemon about anywhere from a quarter to a half a cup
noise reluctant to admit noise
so interesting political trends or events huh
oh you know it it really varies from day to day uh if i am  if i am  on i uh really can hit uh hit my driver pretty well
well you ca not afford to
and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed
it is much more convenient if you are carrying anybody to you know rather than have them_n stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and
things in in the last twenty thirty years uh things  things have  have definitely gone towards uh
it is wood um noise listen to me i ca not even think of the name of my own apartment woodhollow right next to village green it is on yeah kind of far north waco
uh they pushed it back to august
and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball
you know career woman still have a  lot  of  problems here with the good old boys here in texas sort of thing making career moves but
see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation
uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lot  i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids
things at all so the country of uh of kuwait really does not make just a whole lot of sense
right the problem with that in waco is there is not many stations and so you pretty much depend on tapes  and cds etcetera and so on because there is not a whole lot of stations to listen to um
i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh iraq in particular
yeah it is it is been uh we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just
noise i mean i hate to admit it but it is true they they  they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public
but uh most of the time they do not with when follow books very well when they make them into movies
yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different
uh the two extra rooms enclosed i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office
look what their kid just  said said well but um
what would they do for that did they have to cast it and 
yeah are are you suggesting then that if if uh if i have to go and and do something for the country for two years
boy it sounds like you are really into it that is nice
they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period
god so youi have really watched the whole the whole field grow up
boeing or or uh mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a a space shuttle sooner or later
uh you want to start off
uh there is so much  there is so much of a return from prison  to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure and
uh no that was the other guy from cbs oh what was his name uh
really well there is been uh actually some pretty noise interesting interesting topics that ii have had ii have had things from uh tax reform to baseball to fishing those are the three ii have participated in
yeah yeah i am  i like to watch the news uh if  if i really know that something is going on because_n like i say you you can kind of get the headlines and a pretty quick thumbnail sketch of what is going on
yes
and when we are out chasing the big stripers we use those perch for  bait 
my house is on a main road and it has nothing  i mean nothing  but uh what i do do is now ii have always done it at my father is house
yes  yes but for  for some reason
well i think the biggest change in like the last fifty years has been the increased number of women who work
yep that is exactly right
is that on tape  there you go yeah  oh my what else is on i do not know what did they watch in college when you where in where did you go to school
uh now now you are gonna improve and it helps to take lessons and and play a lot you are going  definitely gonna get better but i am  talking about the difference from being a
yeah well they are um you know they are like bermuda  yeah they are like black corduroy bermuda  bermuda shorts and sometimes i wear a blazer with them and i get really a lot of compliments on them um where i work is predominantly male noise so you know
uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge
and do not do what we think is right makes them_n thieves
my advice is is uh
uh i would like i would like to do that but anyway that is that is our typical vacation and uh we enjoy the family vacations but the other ones are very special getaways vocalized noise and we probably take one of each every year how about yourself
maybe because_n she got chubby again or something
  everybody says that 
yeah i had my uh my father in law participated in a uh a jury trial he was he was actually on the jury
i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble
yeah a lot better eds is much  is better than spring creek noise
i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i do not think there are any prescriptions about  against that decision even if uh louisiana chose to go with creole or something
well then why did he say that during his campaign then he should  it was totally vocalized noise
and i do enjoy those quite a bit and um so i tend to
that is on beltline that is close to houston is a matter of fact and um
um it is interesting because i had not thought of them in terms of the problems relative to to uh economy
you know i think there needs to be more severe punishment but it needs to be fair
and i do not know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties
if if it were to spent in the right way i think would not be so upset about it but given that it that it is not spent properly i think it is a major problem
so did did ryder get out of the business is that what happened or
all right um um well uh tell me about the car that youi have got
what else they have over there i do not really ski but i just have heard that it is really good skiing over there 
right i would not be surprised yeah
that guy that was a reporter for cnn
you know which kind of surprised me because the how long have they been out now almost ten years
you know it is it is becoming a a large responsibility but someone  someone has to pay for it and that is us
i like uh to listen to music
yeah it it is amazing there is uh there is a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact her her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in sherman
my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that but i i do not know it was noise i guess i did not realize what a luxury it was at the time
son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school but this was the first year
you know that i  i think but the idea is to is the the compulsive neurotic by gun killer
so we can always run upstairs and you know catch  get a quickie update on what is going on if we really want to
it is not just medical insurance
and uh  yeah oh god pun pun and uh we would go out he liked to go out about five thirty and you know watch the sun come up every morning and uh boy we
well that is good
no  that is  right 
right right and uh
right you know ii have had this is my
degree or something
and the service is okay but the atmosphere is just beautiful it is uh noise you you know it looks like an an old english uh home with uh you know the high back leather chairs and uh uh
so you still do not know because a fanny pack is man or nowadays you know
but she  uh she is a great comfort to me
and uh i think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to
i am  i am  noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming vocalized noise emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of
whatever wei have got coming in check coming in and how much i am  spending each half of the month and then trying to also spend 
and i wanted to be comfortable because i thought the air conditioning would be all turned off you know and jeez if it was not the air conditioner was not blowing it was not fifty five degrees yeah
degrees but but their undergrads are like
so it is kind of hard
they are they are full you know they are for adults they are not just kids cartoons they are they are genuine stories and things
and you just go for the checkup every year or whatever it is just three dollars but if you have a problem then it is real hard to get the doctor to refer you to a specialist because they are told you know not to  because_n it cost the hmo money
and you know like giving them plans  plans for the some of the uh top secret aircraft that we have and things like that i mean that is ridiculous that is only asking for trouble
need the drug  need the money for the drugs and then they are shooting and we have we had a little boy in west  uh well it is west of here
oh dog it was a little uh i got it so it would not would not shed one of french poodle a little french poodle
you know where you should try sometime is colorado it is beautiful absolutely beautiful
hobbies that is about it i do not have much time for hobbies so uh
scholarships for example uh even jobs
um supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional  from the vietnam war on and that tradition is still i mean it is dying now but it is still alive as opposed to
i do not uh
i do believe that is in
 so uh yeah noise uh it was really funny you know that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and and how to uh keep  uh
like after it is been raining for a few months they say the roots have developed so that is all they work on just a leafy they do not do anything
well that the power makes it run it is never ran it is always ran just fine the clock and stuff but it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month for about a month the the clock ran normal
uh financial trouble
well our boys one is uh
although i claim florida as my home now
that a matter of choice or compulsion
yeah it is really sad i do not know i just think um
i always try to vote for those and but i and there are some that if when they have them on saturday i will say all right i am  going to work i am  going to go vote this afternoon
well yes but
um hum
better for companies to do these things get involved in it without huge cost to them because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money just to deal with trash  you know
you work for five six seven and you  you  a lot of people i know guys
just in the metal recycling itself ii have
yeah my wife used to work for a credit noise union group they magazine  they had a newsletter that went out to all the
well yes  uh yes and no i mean um yes  in the winter time yes it is it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly but uh there is really no time of the year that you ca not go
so we we feel as uh but as far as any formal budgeting uh you know i  i we just apparently have
you know i i that is that is the kind of people i like i say i do not think the guy who is going to rob a n eleven is going to rob a n eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever
um hum um hum i know my daughter mostly i do not think she ever wears slacks  slacks to work but i did not know if  the trend changes you know if uh
and they dress up like when customers are coming in or uh when we have department meetings or something like that and um
yeah i was not aware of that either until uh just a year ago when i took a sociology course that even existed that is how indoctrinated i was
and i think that is a mistake
big lubbock yeah are are you a native type planoite or you been here a while or
yeah i  i think so too i think that is a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it it is a good idea to get them_n involved in the city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and
well i wanted to go i was in chicago and i guess i was close to eighteen or something i  i it was like i think the summer between my uh
some quotas of course my family and i again again that was you know my grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas so they had to wait uh
yeah i have um
his name is wolf blitzer did you see it him when he was doing the coverage of the gulf
so that ii have got it ahead of time and i do not have to go out and buy it something not on sale because ii have already gotten it on sale
she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow basic  corn potatoes and uh
and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester
it my subconscious is working on things while i am  working and i i go back and ii have got new ideas but but still
and  get some fresh air in the house and it feels good but
so how you like new jersey
uh you know it it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the state when they
well i think i think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way but they had a lot of uh
noise yeah that they are
well i you know i am  not i am  not racist or anything but one of my one  another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the blacks are poor and therefore they do not have a choice but go in the military
 yeah  that is  true
 oh ii have had them_n like that before too
um but uh it is interesting the only the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling and it sort of gets away from me if you are not with it so but uh i i enjoy
right i feel same way actually um we do not use any of ti is benefits other than i i buy bonds and noise and um
engineers running the train was on drugs you know and people were killed in it and and yeah when it comes to safety and people being killed i definitely think it should be a requirement you know
and um and of course then you know you try to buy right too but um
yeah we taped it uh huh
but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through so that is how i ended up with a honda
it is it is kind of um
oh jeez it is supposed to be eighteen degrees tonight i was thinking about you all the way home from our class just got home from our computer class hey i mean what are the chances of this happening
last night i did noise about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips
no uh in fact that is kind of uh one of the things that is uh funny about it is i go at eight o'clock at night
yeah pushing certain  keys certain times and
 yep but that is what is you have when when you have to deal with the public or deal with the customers they like that that business suit  suit
oh really you like uh so you are an american
yeah there you go and then 
and i do not think i would ever you know do that but they uh asked me if i was a smoker and i did not fit into the smoker is category and i did not fit into the nonsmoker is category um it was you know i was just one of those
uh huh
and anything inside that beltway the highway the real estate is forty thousand dollars more expensive
noise well not in the morning but um if the well i have two son  children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i will
it is hard to tell i at twenty months old he is he wants take her to the zoo and that sort of thing but i am  not sure if she is ready for any of that if she is you know if it could hold her interest
huh
it is yeah it is really bad but um it is going pretty well and ii have got a real good plan mapped out here so
useful or educational  or  something so the two
i mean it is it is gotten worse i graduated about two years ago and even in the past two years it is gotten i mean it is just increased the the crime and the the drugs and the violence and everything have just crime  increased enormously
right and the beach is nice the beach is really nice is not it
so i i guess those are the types i like  wei have really enjoyed them wei have gone to um germany switzerland austria
very much so
before i moved out here we were closer and uh used to vocalized noise go almost
yeah but i think that is for the the few and far between i think that uh
yeah and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these with these all passing it from one to the other
okay so i guess we have nothing to do on the other end there is no uh interruptions here to tell us that we are done or
 yeah exactly yeah yeah it is a sort of a catch twenty two if you are well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the work then you can generally have somebody else do it for you
noise yes living under a bridge so to speak now it is true though that the bulk of of immigrants
well most of the entertaining we do is church associated we have a real tiny little house we do not have room really to have people here but we do get together for what  fellowships at our church and
so everybody is really going crazy you know down here
any handicrafts any handicrafts
right so it is so that is nice it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that but uh
oh from fourteen down to seven
for six hundred dollars
yeah i like the the cosby la law is probably ii have seen cheers more then that i hate to admit but um
i like things like i just mentioned have you ever seen murphy brown or anything like that
just make good friends
and uh wash them_n and cool them_n and then dump them_n in the uh sauce
any of these the public uh stations you know i  i  i  i think i sent in in money for
oh what is he teach
um oh i definitely  i have a a love affair with john bradshaw i just have found everything ii have read of his to be fabulous
uh see ii have driven one import  uh i drove a volkswagen beetle for a while  about a month um in that month i think i put uh three oil coolers on it um
feel to place their children into care and you know it is our society saying yes this um you need this job
um hum that is right that is right
on that uh is it one of those uh afghans that ii have seen in the packages or the the squares  large squares
uh which is you know it is  it  still  works  fine but it is it is actually it is kind of annoying cause ii have got no reason to   to  replace  it but uh
they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i have not talked to uh i have not talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i  i rather imagine there is noise there is some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic
yeah i guess so yeah being told what to do is worse
such as
there are people that are going to make sure that every t is crossed every i is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality now
they are they are nice vehicles 
noise so have you heard about saturns
oh wow well my my husband and i just were there last year um actually we did not take a tour we we were in england and and uh went to ireland and scotland and just rented cars and and did it on our own but
handle with what wei have got i feel like here in texas we pretty much get our monies back out of what we pay i feel very pleased with what they do theyi have put in
well and they are you know they are they are saying right now we do not know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that is just now coming into the work force and in their twenties
you know that they do not serve the full penalty
i worked for a radio station as an undergraduate just the college radio station and had
i know that  i have some friends that have been on juries that have been deadlocked and it is no fun i mean because
and uh theyi have got perkins
frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care and
they are mostly used i mean to they cause a lot of accidents  they there are a lot of accidents because of them being so handy
now ii have been to that i have not been to that yet uh ii have ii have it just  it just does not move fast enough for me i do not think
you know so i just been doing it i try to do it every night you know like i say it just i would rather do that than watch television anyhow
oh wow
and i think that that may be more widespread
boy oh boy that is nice and warm
oh maybe uh maybe back to caddo or um uh purdis creek
yeah if it was
yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because_n there were all different organizations to do there was big brother big sister they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group
well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she is much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that is the fastest way to die i think you know
i think that is that is having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run is that um the the election
well not not as hard as some places out west because you do not get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in denver with the with the inversion and los angeles and all  rest of california which is just terrible it sounds
yeah and but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh
you know you  vocalized noise it could be convoluted  convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them i mean you know you take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever
oh i am  i agree very much so on that i yeah
listen to bruce williams uh for financial advice he is on oh i do not know what he is going to be in austin he is on five seventy here international  oh he is nationally famous
oh well   maybe  maybe  they will  be  all  right i know in mine if i did something like that and then my husband found out jeez he would just 
it is just so fascinating and then everything we get for him is all golf junk you know the golf hat the golf you know clock everything because_n he is he is just he is he is a freak when it comes to golfing
you know um
yeah see mine are up and bloomed already
right right that is we are looking at buying a house and that is one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is
and and most of them are not i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right out  i mean even in high school
and he also works and so um he usually calls me
because_n now now you know he had a shot and and did not look too good and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more
and uh you know perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that uh we would normally do down here that are damaging to the environment
i do not remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek or if it was eighty and a hundred i think it was sixty eighty
uh huh noise uh yeah i am  i am  a noise i  i go to the church of christ ii have been raised in church of christ and uh noise i  i uh
well noise uh i am   i am  i am  rather young i am  only twenty two and so noise uh my knowledge is based you know mostly on what i read you know in history
i uh spent four years as a university professor and yeah
it at times gets incredibly hot here
uh and because of that we began towards the middle of  end of the war i guess about two and a half three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would
yeah wei have had just a few you know freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of april and it is pretty tough
when i  uh let is see winter before last
uh we have a one year old in the house so it is kind of hard sometimes to watch tv during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or um
let is see has it been i think have we been our five minutes
okay do you have  but you have friends that have children
a lot of the things um the demographics too i mean there is more i do not have the numbers in my head right now but a lot of the things that brought feminism i mean there are just more women in in in the demographics just generally in the united states in terms of being
yes
oh and then they would not sink they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them and this is before i was born
and today they checked him out to send him back to mississippi
with children in that situation i i guess one knows one is own storly/story and i know
i really not sure i have not given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know to be
what the uh the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers and the numbers that are being thrown around when when we are talking in trillions of dollars
no i am  not stuck with that kind of a uh situation
noise i am  just happen to be off today so  i work too 
i do not know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product
yeah that is an easy one
that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that saddam hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war
we are uh we are about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff so
he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they were not dope dealers they were not drug fiends they were employees of a
but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let is do this you know
yes i would go for that
oh no no this is a it is a concert band and uh we have a lot of  i  i do not pretend to be that good but there is a lot of people that uh you know our uh band directors at schools or have been or uh you know
we got duke and north carolina
and uh  until next time
oh that is right
okay um what kind of hobbies do you have lori
daughter yes  yes as if the dogs were not enough had to have noise a guinea pig so
being helped gracefully uh i  i myself have done a lot of volunteer work but i am very apprehensive about accepting help
oh now that was fabulous and that you know yeah yeah
cnn has has you know was was pretty good during the war
it would definitely be gun control
to them i admit it  it was fun leave
you know extra things so you you make more fun than you know you know the kids just think it is wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or
i remember my mother used to take the coke bottles in and you get like ten ten cents or something  like  that
noise okay scott let is uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and
i do not know there is supposed to be something more healthy about it  poultry instead of the beef and
but i did not have to worry about all that because
and i do uh about sixty uh
apparently more landfill available than it is a matter of economics and economically right now uh it is more of a scare tactic it appears that we are running out of things and the facts
unto themselves kind of
a bridge to forever those are really  really mind expanding  books his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of
wow that is great that is great that kind of gas mileage uh we are we are kind of hoping for on our van 
she made these onion rings that were so good and and and uh you do not realize how many dishes you put onions in that it is an ingredient and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better
oh yeah  that is strictly for entertainment  that was just  it was
yeah uh
no no i am  not into the the do not do the the raw raw fish like that but i do like uh like a seafood bar like a raw raw bar like oysters and things like that uh
and my feeling is that you you know you are only a kid once and you do not wanna spend your whole life in school
and sick and uh so i have kind of slowed down a little bit
my uh youngest sister is at byu now and so they have no one at home she is back teaching school full time now again
um also there is uh a uh tradition of just doing enough to get by
i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision
yeah well that sort of thing could work um
oh okay yeah golly ii have got up up at work anyway i use uh wordperfect and lotus and
you know she does not have a brown nose and her eyes  she is sort of unicolor you know eyes are the same color and everything so
yeah i have two plots one is ten by ten and one is like fifteen by four it is a long skinny one and
ii have heard the name and that is about all it goes
it is so scary
well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there um hum well now um
oh yeah 
hi
i know is not that funny
that uh
right i  i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i do not think the the the probability that we are gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fairly  is fairly high
but you know there is  there is the difference because_n uh they say you know
out there to please the special interest groups as well
uh huh health food uh restaurants that
uh you know a a non a non critical error  error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker is being supported
is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal they are the ones with the rights
that is my oh yeah
well i would definitely have to look at price
a buttons pc file program that uh is a very simplistic relational data base for labels and things so i guess i would have to say on a home setting i am  probably on
we uh we have stuff that is very interesting yeah
what you are doing i think and uh that is something that um
if the criminal chooses to have a three panel judge uh a three judge panel i should say i think he can have that rather than trial by jury
deep you have deep one yes
we  had some hanging uh flowers in the on the porch and um
no no she is noise i do not think i could part with her
several reason why i  i could think of right now why we should not have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it
but they may have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety
sure sure
they have but just of they made jokes about him like on the carson show and all that jay leno
they thought than they were thirty years ago i mean they were the school i was teaching at the the year i left they are considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids
um hum do you find that you are uh noise uh disappointed or pleased with uh uh the performance of like network coverage of news
i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school that is good for that
you know and it was supposed to be a basic  you know starting to learn the colors and and learning to associate with children so that when he went to you know a school
pretty much hike out most of the time
well let me let me encourage you to stop  stop and experience life along the way
after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it is done
well i took data processing in college
and they got her going again
that is way too much yes it has
yeah the heavy metal 
how much how well they are doing yeah we do i um i i work in a uh speech interface lab at a at a at a college
no no and uh what  let is see uh the
that is true
we are just going to see repercussions  repercussions  repercussions down the line because he is he will probably maintained power it sounds like he is uh you know uh knocked down the revolt you know so
yeah there is
people that i work with at night now and the younger group they do not watch too much
but um you know i think the schools are at where the schools is not just the school system and not just the teachers they took in the whole town plus all you know
um from the people ii have talked to i do not know if i should bring this into it but um a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more um where they could manage their own schedule
i do not know i just feel like my daughters are in college now and the last three years their life they went to public school and they made straight as and they are really struggling in college now
tax free or die uh huh
yeah oh boy the the that whew that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather
that much of a difference uh wow
and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
uh yeah most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
uh yeah yeah i think it is two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh
g o m p h r e n a gomphrena
noise anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh
i mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people
you know and then you  you  you find out you can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these people have been you know dumping information about you in there and ii have heard of cases where it was just done vindictively
on the west  east coast
if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they would have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing
one for a total ban and uh
uh we try to go once maybe twice a summer uh
he says my father gave it to me
yeah well i feel like the the cost of someone  someone was quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year
something on that order i have not really determined if i like the the japanese or the if i like them enough to purchase one
and it is just that i think they are just tying up the um whole judicial process um there is a lot of things they could do
you know there is government medical care and that kind of thing if it it is the lot where it is funded by the individuals
yeah the marcos
well until  until recently i was taking the wall street journal and i thought that was a good way but i have about
a rapist goes out and for that guy to walk free if i mean he deserves to be executed as far as i am  concerned if they get the hard facts on him and he is guilty
but that is not um something we did by ourselves if you talk about home repairs um tom is real good at mowing the grass and doing the garden so  that is  about  it
i do not know their style of play was so much different from some of the teams that just run and gun
delivery room and everything include including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay but that was that was still included in that price  that cost so noise it is really nice because they
uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to washington or to the state and they say they are going to send some back it is like giving yourself a transfusion  it is like one arm giving the other a transfusion
yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that um are not premeditated
um and uh so we are we are part we are actually part of mit so it is very much the same kind of place and a technical institution
and um that is worn out  and and if i would have had the money to go buy a car i would probably get a toyota just because
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence
i do not want tomatoes in it mom when he came home from babysitter the other day and i asked if she fed him yeah but she made me eat tomatoes with i mean spaghetti with tomatoes in it he is upset
that i am  i am  kind of working just waiting a little bit to make sure i do not push something too too hard on her
and i personally feel if they  if they have draft  the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men
yeah but it is close to philadelphia and baltimore so it is
you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who is important  whose decisions are important and vocalized noise you know that is
and so i do not like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so
grandfather is house where his mother had been raised a little bit of the time theyi have  theyi have still got this old home in their family and
no i have one lives in amsterdam holland and uh one lives in uh
you know this thing in saudi arabia and all and they still do not allow women to vote it is still amazing of course we we do not have such a wonderful history that
i do not have one in my home here my um parents have one and they live just about_n three miles away so we use that one and my in laws also have one and they are almost as close they are in richardson
that is sad
and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up
yeah right
oh that is interesting
so i  i  i think that it could go even farther than
oh goodness they are
right that keeps you busy
noise no no she is not at all her books uh
major dad the monday night comedies on cbs like major dad  murphy brown is one of my favorites  for  huh for some reason she reminds me a lot of myself  it is just the writing i think the writing on that is real good
that is that is the big thing you know we still got a little bit of the old
and that is why you are and the the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in because the windows are something that is conducive to
and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then got  took took that well actually both
bushes and plants and brought them to the front door  and  the  back  door  and  laid  them  on  the  patio so it is like our backyard is just kind of like as long as he wo not damage it fine and if he will if there is anything he will hurt we just do not put it out there anymore
and i usually do it because_n i want to because i know it is good for me not because you know i do not i do not feel obligated to do it and i enjoy it
yeah she is into
and that is what  you know a lot of the things that we did in school ii have never used and never will use
and bush has already given his  opinion on it right did not i read that
subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh
where you can go and and new equipment that is come out and so forth some fashions are always in there too
so he was in a bad way but uh it is he was fast
not really
hm
one year we went to the southwest corner of colorado into durango and north of the area there and uh
uh bearing investment
they tried to get get tickets and man the scalpers that were out wanted a hundred and fifty per ticket
but trade a year
right i do not no not in plano
yeah see the the the economic situation on the whole thing and then uh well it is see we do have things that we are  concerned about here this generation i do not know
in north uh in oklahoma it is the men is garden clubs that i would have wanted to join
uh i am  kind of a
uh either for the thrill committing the crime or the thrill the feeling of power that they get from it or to
so i like something that is kind of quick and and i love i like doing the samplers i have a whole wall of them and he will just take this sampler which is just you know mediocre not so great and when he puts the colors he picks out little bits of
well that is um i guess references or whatever from other people first of all and then
and uh but grew up in uh iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of  lawn and garden work uh and uh
yeah they play two or three times a week
how did this work a male rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think he is sick and she said i do not think he is sick i think she is  pregnant
um hum well when you use real people like that i think you know and royalty especially you know
unfortunately that kind of thing is not
and uh i have a friend  a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars
 really
the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean one  one of the guys that was doing it was uh like uh a waiter at one of the restaurants that know  you know like the military had
yeah have them women look at you in that sports car driving  around oh goodness
it is i guess pretty pretty healthy but i do not have an a regular plan that is
uh the women did not have  have near the positions the levels that the men attorneys had and were not uh given the same respect
maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote
um hum well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way and that that they could not they found that they could not you know give her
read i read the newspapers sometimes and i watch cnn and that sort of thing occasionally and vocalized noise i
kids or kid i am  not sure to school in the morning and be home
and how long had he been appealing  appealing how long was that
then  and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that and pretty soon they are they are figuring out that is not such a bad way to go but
yeah well the fly on the end weighs nothing it weighs less than the line
well i am um i am  gosh i am  barely in dallas i am  just north of addison airport up on the tollway
i guess it was probably in the fifties but there is a strong wind
and uh took them about an an hour
 no  right it will teach a great lesson because she ended up so in so well  but it was a fun movie to watch
well that is true i uh i like it when they have short stories like redbook used to always have a good short story in it
do you think a rule against a certain uh um
oh yeah you are that is a good point but at ti they before they had the testing ii have forgotten it  seems  seems like it is a year ago september something like that
um personally i do not have a problem with it uh i think uh
but i do not like something fake or put on either uh
uh huh well we have a wood burner in our house and you know it heats a lot of it because it is a larger house it would be too much to heat with just electric but uh we have yeah
yeah they you know about the only other kinds of things i like um i like to watch a lot of news um do not you miss that with not having a television so far
in richardson we are in plano here and i have a daughter in middle school and uh i know there are not very many but she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home but do you see
oh man
and you are right i mean i like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably would not be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu
what types of things have you looked for when you are um when you were looking in for  to the child care there
they do not want us go out on the beach you know said it was very dangerous
i just got that a few days ago
i am  a doctoral student in florida right now
it is
what do you do while you are there
i read an article a couple weeks ago they were talking about uh talking again about the ozone layer they said that the uh
we have we have we have a soccer field that is um oh about a hundred yards from our house
oh uh huh
it was really my ex who did the the uh uh the cooking back when we first started
and wei have always uh oh tried to take our children and now now this age our grandchildren
oh yeah definitely if it is a limited edition usually no matter what it is if it is a limited edition it is usually worth something later on
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
financial uh applications that you make out you do not have to put all that stuff down there it would be nice to know what is what was
just east of dallas there
yeah and they they dull after a while especially i did some cabinets in um ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down
well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes and the the
average human beings like you and i average joes that make a decent salary that are a graduate of the school send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars but thousands of people
yeah there you go yeah i really like that show
yeah well uh i i i i have not been to beirut but ii have heard what a wonderful city that is just totally gone to uh ruin
to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they are called and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh
but i am  going to be retiring at the end of december and i i hope uh the next fishing season that i can sort of get back in and uh enjoy that that that was a really enjoyable uh thing for me to do
and uh it is it is that little piece of land over  there well i had uh tomatoes and and uh uh peppers
and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah
and they had misclassified  the sex of the  the  uh rat there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the size of a mouse
well yeah did
what do i do um at the moment it is utter chaos  um
exactly i i see more men um like participating in like the family things with children like you know helping to take care of them_n more and
and and i suppose because it is for me ethical we would just play up the fact that
but uh
and yeah and uh i will i talked to a thirteen year old last night who is uh goes to uh
see uh and i just started working well for an electronics firm down here i used to be a reporter and then now i am  in corporate communications and uh part of that noise excuse me was as a new hire that i had to take a drug test and i had never been asked that and i thought
and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in another it once it gets full getting it loaded into the car and taking it is a pain
oh uh huh and that is how you got involved yeah no we we have um uh my husband is sister lives in dallas actually and they kind of got it us involved that way
oh gosh uh any people who had drug  tested positively getting them into a drug program or rehab program
noise because that is where all the drug  the gangs get their power over the drugs because it is illegal
you were he was waiting for what again
yeah he is he is about my favorite
i think two i know they lost yeah to washington and philadelphia
that is true i do the same  thing
but not that i will ever go i had not been to a cowboys game last time last time i went to the cowboys game was during that um nfl strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh dallas and washington redskins game
well i am  not a ford person and never have been as a kid and uh i do like the v eight engines and i think the the
well do not bother  well oh from a woman is point of view and it was very uh
 right
yeah they are as far as their like pension plans i think  they are vested a lot earlier i think at ti it is what five years
uh squirming  squirming i call it of the foundation we are just on a concrete slab you know but uh the soil right under this is a clay and it um
uh all of mae west is movies
that is true that is true i do not know
no and that is something  that is something that just you know it it does not take a long time to fix and it is really good and it is really good for you and we eat out a lot
you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess maybe a little longer
right exactly
they are doing uh curbside recycling which is something a lot of cities are starting to look into but for some cities it is very expensive
uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt
yeah have you ever lived in a in a well but dallas is i am  is are you calling from dallas
uh huh i heard about that
noise um it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough
uh i actually replaced all the other guttering last year and and the piece that i did this year seemed all right at the time so i left it alone
my  my wife is not real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it everything
i do not know i do not know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there but
noise so noise
i remember it took me a long time it took me like several months or several weeks to do it during the summer and then after i got it done it was pretty dark and ended up not being real smooth looking
okay um where  uh where do you stand uh
you know they are
we are to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so
noise pretty good pretty good so we are talking about drug testing in the work place huh
well i wish i did i am  still working but i will be retiring soon
because it is it
she is really training and i when we were in college we both chain smoked like freight  trains and she would get out and run everyday and it never would bother her and it is like it do not bother me
the t i thing oh that is neat
so  i remember some of the strange potty training experiences when i we were growing up amongst brothers and sisters
and when my father lived with us um i made more of an effort to learn but um that is something that i
yeah it has been and um so there have been major major adjustments but that is another story but you know my husband has really really
wow
i do not know much about that at all
i may have referred to a couple of them_n but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information and picked up a lot of brochures
the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem
what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now and we hopefully we will be getting them in the month of october
um wei have tried them_n but again it is just like the sun scorch wei have tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the sun  i mean it is just
noise you know almost like they are mentally retarded patients or something and some of them you  know they are just sitting in the wheelchair and sleeping or whatever and it is just  it is heart breaking you know and  and i  i feel like you know what have i moved into and  and they are
um i got a seventy chevelle that i am  restoring too so it is uh there is constant work going on to that car
and uh
yeah i saw reruns of it i saw yeah tapes of  yeah
and i found uh my son is um uh second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all
true yeah i noticed that about things like i seen  i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers
takes about another twenty minutes
uh i could not believe it i because i mean  i used to live in atlanta years ago and it was always fairly clean i mean you you always you did not have problem with stagnant air like like la does
like a plate over the top and let it steam and then and then stir it up
i would think so um seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf and it was not until late in the summer they started making fruit so i do not know if i am  mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon you know but i do not
and uh uh i guess when you are down here in dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the cowboys um because_n uh you know this is a big football territory down here and uh uh
and uh then we have you know whatever is left over is disposable income  disposable disposable  yeah discretionary income
but i do not know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we are not used to having i am  not used to having women in in roles like that you know as role models
of the american public i think what they will do is start paying mexico to take our trash
and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of of family big part of
and then you know too that uh taxes are are less like if you live in mesquite
no not six feet but
at a i teach college class and uh there is a the library has a paper and so i often drop in on a break and
judith krantz
yeah i stir fry things on occasion but i would like to know more about you know more elaborate things i guess
and you know if you do not really count if you are not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it does not impact you directly or if your management does not think that
so it is it is just so complicated anymore i think people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is you are extending life
yeah well my my oldest is only nine so he  he has not really gotten into um that yet they have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to but um
uh huh yeah i saw it
you know out on the on the beach
um hum noise no noise we do not have guns because we do not go hunting or anything like that but like i say my son he is
um hum yeah we we try to uh go with another couple that have
now they are just doubling their stress and that is  and that is really
that i do not get any exercise doing that and plus there is a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner and i need to go out in the morning and run or i will just get nuts
uh it is in georgia it is yeah it is right outside of macon and and it is just a i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is
the people that are that are in there
oh well let is see um
oh that is very interesting
uh do you know where uh custer is okay he is
something you have to do 
that is true that is exactly where we are
well uh living near the nation is capital unfortunately does not do you any good uh all  i all i uh find that i can do is read the newspapers and try to decide what is best for us
was from plano
i do not know i do not know i i i do not know what the likelihood of that is there you know people really waking up especially with the ultra conservative
i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably would not have the problems we have
too country for me
really important i  i  i  ca not  i guess we grew up in such a different world i could never even imagine taking hostages
you know kind of deltaing off what what wei have been talking about here uh i believe that
you know through ellis island you know
and there is not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
uh some of the young
uh huh uh huh
yeah and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said uh well he did comparable that it is about eighty dollars
seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped and people do not do anything
we have quite a quite a few benefits and uh we have um
and i ii have been doing a a picture for my father in law that if i  i ever get enough spare time he might see  it one day and  and some other things i like to do are is music and um noise also reading
right oh those things are great i boy i encourage those noise yeah you are you do not own a house and i am  fifty eight and i just built my fourth home
we were we our business was on the other side of the island we were only in san juan it was at night
so that was nice  so i guess i do like camping 
well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you are ready to get another car just pay cash for it
yes we  wei have my uh well when we first got married my wife worked for a year
noise vocalized noise i guess vocalized noise since ii have uh been a vegetarian ii have loved fettucini alfredo noise and so and so ah but any place i go that has that that is what  that is what i eat  it  does not does not matter
you know i i everything is so automated uh and things can be made without  i  think a human hand ever  touching  it  you  know an awful lot of things and i think uh that certainly makes a difference from
hm nah i did not know that because_n we just usually if we are gonna um buy sodas they are in the the two liter bottles
noise and that is a big jump
what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism
um but you know locking someone up and not getting
no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are no matter what a lousy system they are in or anything else these people somehow manage to uh
i agree 
i do not know
so i really do not have a problem with it
noise i had another couple of kinds that ate each other so that bunch did not work either 
because we had noise we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in
probably a lettuce salad and  a
yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did ii have i was an engineer with uh
in our company even though we do not have the random or even regular drug screening in fact they will  have these little parties and people will just get i mean ii have my brother lives where i work and i have many a time called him to come get me you know and um
going in vocalized noise going to uh and her husband had escaped to hong kong uh and then she put in to go see him
where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor is are available if they need them and allows
you know because  because of of the audience  you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were in people that no one really cared about
what what bothers me is uh my wife was in just for a little bit and she went in to the  emergency   emergency room and they charged they had two needles one was like twenty seven dollars and one was twenty eight dollars for a needle
he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home and uh so it takes him a little bit of time and
do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
noise um
well uh in uh san antonio noise the parking downtown i work downtown and the parking is so dadgum expensive you basically have to car pool to be able to afford to park it costs seventy five dollars a month just to park my car
theyi have had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much
um i guess i  i grew up on it and it is fun it is it is an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control
well uh who have had some really startling discoveries recently as to how much things cost at the uh at a hospital and health care
i have uh i have used lotus i have used uh word perfect uh i not heavy use ii have used uh d base and uh ii have used a substantial amount of shareware
but uh the russian economy they you know they i do not know what the percentage is but i heard it one time it is just some ungodly number just to support the military machine
yeah it is pretty  uh it is pretty funny i mean they do some crazy things
uh we had a friend give it to us
yeah i ii have you know i see that all the time as a matter of fact i live uh literally right across the street from a golf course here in texas
i know a lot of people with diesels  unless it is a truck you know
you know typically you vocalized noise if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
people are um reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it is uh they do not have kids in the schools
and and then i have my um um i have a seven month old granddaughter and uh her mother stays home and she they live with  they live with us you know as in orange county is really expensive
so um but they are that is what they do they take care of basically the front yards and unless you do not want them to do it and
see there was what was it massachusetts i remember here a couple of years ago reading about one that had been on fire for  long period of time you know it just smolders and the black smoke pours out of it
do you like reading as a hobby
cadillacs that we are looking would  would be looking at to begin with so noise
so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we have  we are allowed to vote in you know like you say we are out in the labor force but i think wei have lost something too
when i was growing up and i before  before i was married i was teaching school and teaching down in corpus christi and i wanted to be able to at least change a flat tire
i mean prove a person guilty if you do not really know or you do not really have a eyewitness
it is like going to arizona  well probably what you arizona used to be like you know it is just dry and cool so it is not it is not what you think it is
pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for
well what the problem we got is that wei have got five children
i do not usually watch the news at night time because_n uh i am  you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it is already over and
um no um it snowed a little bit um probably about four days ago and
oh naked gun two and a half
noise i would imagine that is right
uh well at the time i was uh thinking of going premed and in the state uh they had the best pre med uh curriculum for the
so that is i think that is good to keep the equal as far as
blow out their opponents they just score just enough points and that really impressed me but ii have been down here i live  laural is pretty close to new orleans and ii have been keeping up with the saints a lot
uh but jenny is a sweet kid
homes yes sir um hum
so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some
and uh i am  trying to think what else i like to watch on television {sportswise} i like i like tennis so i mean i am  not i have not played in years but um i just like to watch you know two two players really get go at it on television
and uh the tax was administered by um
i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean in  you know when they are in the college
yeah yeah i do not i do not think there is any clear pick that you know
and so i you know am  am probably being very naive  i am   hoping that that by by centralizing it it might get better and be cheaper
oh  oh well so are you have just  are you just starting out at school
and it just ruins you too you just makes you sick and then you have insurance you know goes up and
well i  i think uh so far theyi have been pretty  pretty good except the medical uh
uh vocalized noise justified you know or brought up to whatever over the state salary level uh
that is right and and i have i have no problem
and yet they
well you we watched it the times wei have seen it it is been like on saturday  or excuse me friday night uh but it is wei have only seen it a couple of times but it
so i i would hate to have that noise responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address
but they were not
 well uh she she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher she  she has she has two half day classes so she has uh
supplemental anything is important today i will tell you whether
i sometimes it can be sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing ii have ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things
something is coming through now so it is like in the low forties right now
what are you trying to get
perhaps the first grade level which would be
as you can well imagine it is very hard for me to imagine that that uh a honda is going to be as safe a car as as the one that ii have got got my eye on which is a volvo
and then you are in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and the next thing you know your knees are wet
and so um yeah  uh yeah i guess i usually do i like to cook um heavy sauces and um
yeah i could use a discount  i have to wait for things to go on sale  noise
we ca not do that so  um we like to uh rent videos and sit down and have a video bash pop popcorn and
there is a percentage  certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey
but as far as what i would really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could
has to change yeah noise yeah
it is that close to dallas oh do not you it is i guess  guess it is out there clear out they have a ranch it has like five hundred acres and
vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
yeah yeah um
because_n that is hard ours our kids have gotten
wow it really is and you get together once a year wow uh
is it in dallas
right well the same here actually i do not use drugs at all and i and i am  at at most a social drinker so it is so it is never a problem
if i only had some place that i could store the uh camper top i would have it off most of the time
oh  well my my feelings on are it is uh i would not take a child to a  day  care
uh though there is you know probably i am  sure some sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns
oh i see uh so you are in uh in part of a band
you know so it really is a different um
uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got vocalized noise i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really
i mean they they uh go home and grade papers lesson plans prepare for the next day
that uh you know why vote when it is decided already
but anyway uh let me talk  are you uh are you married
i do not think so
yes well yeah i am
i think ii have had about four yeah  yeah yeah it is vocalized noise well you know when i had to set  huh this is my my gemini nature you know it is like what are you interested in and it is like virtually anything i will talk about  anything with anybody
otherwise not although i can  uh would get quite a break on on tuition  yeah because they uh allow for uh
well that
it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real
noise we have uh some friends who live on a lake and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with bass to the point where you know normally you go you  you  go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or
but no colorado  not in colorado since i was in college because_n i went to school have not been there i keep hearing these marvelous things about deer valley and um <b_aside> do not adam <e_aside> um vocalized noise city
because i remember going as a teenager before i was ever married and then my husband and i went uh while we were still dating and it is still going on and
everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or or afraid that they are gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise
put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just
not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area north carolina
they ca not really support themselves so
i would say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic
i know i know the shortcomings too
i am  a nurse
uh racial i think
um
and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies and it was just such a delightful time
well see my my husband likes noise the simpson is and i do not care for it too much my kids you know sit there an laugh with it when their dad laughs but
yeah yeah  the yeah that is a that is a definite security involved in uh in a dog like that
just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing
that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts
um i grew up in wyoming so i you know we had
yeah yeah but it it bmw is good for that what kind of driving just like commuting you would want to do it use it for
but it see men are coming into their own now too
okay ii have been there um one down there is the uh i think it is an old schoolhouse uh
yeah it it is a little disturbing
um or at least i did not think so but my mother worked and i kind of now wish that that she had not that uh
oh okay vocalized noise get so attached to them
it is i do not see how anyone can afford it
twelve pounds so i need to work and get it off i thought about doing a diet but i really do not need to diet i  i just need to
twin falls it  that is kind of by uh have you heard of sun valley or boise
peddling products if i wanted their products i wouldi have either gone to the store to bought it or i wouldi have called for their salesman  salesman to come out
oh yes vocalized noise and and there is big differences of course and
situation yeah
no i never have tried that just because i do not have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment um or this little balcony and my my other two pots are they are kind of they are pretty big and and i have enough plants in them_n that um
so you do that and right and then we try to do a family activity on saturday usually in the morning
uh up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago i got one for my son a a macintosh  macintosh uh lc it is a real easy to use color uh
 really
yeah wei have wei have got maybe  maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil and then it is solid rock from then on down so 
but then i did not  i had not thought about doing it with uncooked rice so just like in a thirteen by nine pan
oh it is uh mitzi
 and that the your children can use the benefits of that university well that that is an excellent idea that is an excellent idea
it was it was filmed in ireland
well and they are so busy people people is personal schedules are so busy
oh oh oh oh i bet you those are i bet you what those things are um is a dutch iris

we went during the drought
well the uh
uh my car does not go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there is hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i will do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and
one of the parties wants one and i usually it is the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
bought a mitsubishi mirage here a couple years ago and and it was normally carbureted and it is fairly easy to work with because there is not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff
three year old is in um a university of gymnastics it is a a preschool and um i think it was really hard to um to pick the right uh
yeah ii have got to try i um
well  he did not have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you are reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor
oh i do too and i think uh what caught so many of our attentions last year was that nolan ryan you know yes
a lot of money i bet well that is great noise well noise yeah i guess that about does it
you know that is not an issue but that is primarily you know where i end up getting it from
of basic belief or something down inside of you then it is very difficult to
well we have the the usual automotive pollution that and although it is not very visible you do not worry about that uh too much uh but uh
yeah oh i do too i do too
you know if that is what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so
let is say i would have to say overall that the the war was was beneficial to the united states with with the change in attitudes and all that you know all that stuff i mean it is
no and even  even like you know two thirds majority i mean
so uh it is not too but there is full uh there  there is several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything i do not get sick that often so i do not pay much of it but you know i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital
you know that which  which amazes me um i i you know it never occurred to me how expensive that sort of thing can be
but he does not seem to be bothered with them you know he is real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he is he is not too bad
season of a lot of new movies coming out but then there is these um periods like early fall before christmas or early spring when there is sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again
well it is an italian um
you are gonna have a lot of vocalized noise more choices but in urban areas it is  you  know steak  places  an and it is not a you know it is uh it is definitely it it is it is changing to a degree but
and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market we would have uh
all that other good stuff that ate them_n all up
no i ca not hear them_n
yeah yeah really
well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like
i live in san antonio
they would have references to literature and things like that and they would also just have odd thing they walk into a bank vault and there is a deer head lying on the  table  in  the  bank  vault
we can throw them_n in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that is expected of us and we have no downtime
in some places they do not but you know you youi have got specialized education now
well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that you  you know we could be looking for a very warm summer i really do not want that 
yeah but the the  no  no longer  i do not think so
and uh so it is it is it is
they have no moral conscience
uh like a uh they are very light weight and we use them_n when we go backpacking
no yeah well that is just it because i mean jeez theyi have got probably  probably good twenty years to live you know some  some cases if they are healthy you know
is a preschool that does not have any day care at  all but it is such a wonderful preschool so i had to find somebody else to keep them_n and then and then somebody to take them_n there
uh a bathroom or a shower or anything near by  it was dig your own hole and um and i
noise oh dessert um sometimes i buy  it  i have through the years i used to make this really neat pie that was  was with crackers and pecans on 
all right all right  well leslie it is been very nice talking to you is there anything else that you would like to mention tonight or
that is true that is so true how how did your daughter do it
um hum there that is true
i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize
you know what i am  saying
and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast  it is just solid sandstone
noise wei have had them_n you know say that they are going to be get this real bad ice storm and
uh how can they concentrate on schooling i agree with you i think that is the main problem
money instead
i suspect that it just disappeared
i guess that is the best way you know to get recommendations from your friends or family members
during my work i have to keep up on all the noise new computer equipment and software and everything and i have to read the magazines you know such as byte and computer world and mac world and all these
but uh noise boy yeah
you know so it is pretty important to um i also like very much the new split skirts
yeah so so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice i love her you know i enjoy being with her i guess that is one thing but also uh that that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
day care noise two days a week they call it senior citizen day  care but she goes to the senior citizen center
that come out which they the news is not like immediate what you would generally think of as news but it is recent material
i have lived
think wei have talked long enough
spring and well i guess we are still in winter and uh
okay very good it was nice talking to you
there used to be one that was a twenty four hour that i used to go to but uh i actually prefer to work out alone
noise yes i do
uh i really do not do not do much with it at home but uh
sure
so uh
pretty well designed and then of course pine hurst and
uh but dances with wolves did not seem to have anything added it was just all legitimate kind of uh film and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many oscars uh
yeah and she is more famous for that but she has been writing
vocalized noise um um working with flowers and stuff like that
it spans about forty feet on one side of of our fence but we have the perfect yard for it because the sun comes up in the morning and strikes the back yard all morning until you know about
well that is one problem but also these um these fast oil change places you just ca not beat them_n for sixteen bucks they will not only will they change your oil in ten minutes and do a fine  you know vocalized noise good a job as i can do but they will uh lube too noise
all right and what did 
well like i said
uh both those centers of of business plus everything else that is scattered around here and there
and uh it did not seem like it was that congested in that that part you know because_n to me where we live out here in the north east it it is there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
and what is that other one where they  where they do the um skits well you must have seen it recently
yeah oh definitely
okay yeah yeah that is one of the more um yeah i have some friends that uh have younger children and they send them to the montessori system
uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh i am  kind of like you i do not have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe that is our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we do not have any we have more
aluminum can smashers  and you can go up there and and uh redeem wei have got one that gives you like a penny a can
we visit mexico occasionally so  yeah we we do have a little information on it here but uh
i would say definitely go see that part and uh
no no noise he is yeah he is great and uh he is uh he is really spoiled though  so but he is
yeah that is strange um hum
to have them go there and then if you find out that they are not having good care you know i am  sure that it is just you know you would pull them_n out of there so fast
yeah i think that is uh i i think that is a good term demanding  demanding the time for yourself but you youi have just got to youi have just got to prioritize  right
you are a financial planning firm how many uh
they do not even talk about that they just raise it they do not even consider it like you saying is to cut something back you know
i have one she is twenty months old
but there uh well  as a first time home buyer i know what you mean there is a lot of things you are not sure about what to look out for the only really trouble wei have had with our house is the seals breaking between the double panes and water  moisture
and it was a a apparently it went on over a year they are a very wealthy family
the as the one that questions um the what is going on and uh in the end of uh the son in law when he did get the mother in law up to the cliff uh
so uh so we when we go we have about do about fifteen miles a week but the last little while for one the reason or another we have not been  real  consistent so
right nobody does yeah then uh huh i know
so i do not know
nothing i think ii have been trout fishing once uh
and you know it is just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i am  not sure about  about um macintoshes but i know in ibm is you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time
oh i cannot believe uh what they are doing uh academically the demands on them
noise and i i guess the the next one is is door to door solicitors i do not mind the children when they are selling things for school i have kids and you know that is just kind nosy of noise part of it but when
um and it was really revealing to see some of the you know the things that go on i guess in some of these homes so i would definitely noise you know want to really check things out and
we do not get that  okay if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most
cambodia
no okay yeah
so you had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably
yeah  yeah they are sometimes you are in the mood for it even noise
well you realize why we were
well no she did not live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money
oh i  i  i agree i my point was that the police want to get rid rid of the people of of guns and what is happening is that i see i  i  i view this country as as as we have
now i i would like to see {bettle/better} better dental insurance
uh you know what i miss though basements
yeah i  i can understand their viewpoint they are just they are starting off and their economy is a little bit weak so they want to get established before they
well the one i think is interesting is the california los angeles police chief who says he wants to  resign and did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that uh he should
experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat
for adults also and so i thought hey i will just try this you know and see what it was like it was very um noise the style was very conversational
grew i grew up in chicago so yeah you know we had a lot of snow up there
eighty five i started looking and it seemed like the further i got away from dallas center
boy you are you are you are right up there about where i am then 
oh yeah
yes that is right he would be worth it yeah he would be worth it
oh noise yeah the the the ice
they are the first  but they are the first ones that will come up and say you know you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you to your classes and things like that and and uh
um it is not one of the bigger ones it is probably hm
oh no i am from kentucky
uh trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house and i ended up getting one that uh came out of a a a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did
 since theyi have been to phoenix they have not been uh
is that right
but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
a switcheroo huh
you probably have some friends that have  television 
and do it again and i do not think that that rehabilitation is effective
you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired
yeah um there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test but they did not know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down
yeah actually see i am  i am  sort of uh there are there are some other things i am  against  i am  against also i think  i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which i am  also against
um but um
i do not know what what kind of
but she could not cry in front of them because they would do it more
like when say we retire after the year two thousand
although i see  you know i am  starting to see some of their um there is there is a daily new
but um i my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you are going to make it work too hard that is yeah so  that is why i do that
i guess we are pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are drive by shootings and uh
uh during the incidents where they were you know like they are not paying their their restaurant bills and they are bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
yes i know what you mean
that is really neat
no i have not
and none of them even smoke they do not uh they never been strangely enough uh their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up
i yeah i think that is a a good thing in 
i think i think michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older guy she 
and apparently the rangers last year won a lot of one run games
um i do not noise there is something about the mac  a lot of things about the mac i do not like i do not like the size of the screen i have an old uh plus i do not like the keyboard but i  it is extremely easy to use
you know you uh think you call it plan d  deductibles are really high it is like fifteen hundred dollars
were black and silver and gold and red and i am  talking about paper backs you know
well theyi have uh statewide raises they raise ours it seems like constantly we just uh passed a new one
well there is there is a guy on that was on norm hisken is show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh it is essentially trivial statistics but theyi have got a statistic  it is a statistic that has to do with winning
yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the water  we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was
oh that is a pretty good deal
okay um i do not have any i guess definite views about elderly care um
uh me too because you know with utilities and and homes that are uh price of homes has went up drastically  drastically like an average house is now a hundred thirty thousand
no no no i like the pro i like actually i like pro basketball as opposed to even  i will watch pro football but i like the nba play offs
oh well that is nice
it is it is it is so much better to to rent
okay we um i am  presently living in a house uh first time uh
and i know that uh the results that they get out of the system sometime is  is is certainly not
a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the uh she was in the junior olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very very big sports backgrounds to have they leaned  leaned away from that sort of
i do not enjoy that at all when they are just talking about well i am  better than you and blah blah blah i do not like that i like the funny satire and then some of it is
came back here and could not realize why i would been so depressed through the winter
dry out there we did not have a whole lot we just had a little bit lot of dew this morning
and to this day twenty years later i am  like i am  in my thirties i am  not that old but i am  going jeez i ca not believe that thing is still on  television
no no kids
you know answering service anyway unless i am  home
somebody told me the other day that there is what  what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true
i mean i  i can tolerate a lot of different things and i can you know i can tolerate a certain amount of rap but if i have to listen to two songs in a row i am  ready to shoot somebody
but some schools i  i do not know see i  i live in a small community noise and um
um hum
are living pretty pretty good life styles but they are not paying income tax and that is not fair to me and there is you know some people who uh are abusing
well that is right and we never have signed up for those i just have not been interested in what they generally have on and
uh i think you need to plan on you need to be sure and plan uh at least a year ahead of time or you are going to lose people
and stand up for yourself decide what you think and
so well i have two daughters and um
because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it is hit
a lot of times uh
you would go vocalized noise from having fifty sixty degree days right into the eighty eighty five degree days which you know in texas it is not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty
so would i 
well this is uh like retirement benefits and it is a bunch of different benefits in one it is not just
what do you call it ca not even remember it is been so long noise um office administrator or whatever it one of those titles
oh well that is that is helpful yeah our family ranges from oh goodness
but it is hard i do not know in in compared to say my mother and father
achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether youi have got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether youi have got a
you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right off the screen
vocalized noise made some special um polymers that have the ability to uh make certain actinide elements adhere to them um
yeah  i agree  i am  sure we will be watching more uh children oriented television shows
and i make a thickened blueberry sauce and i layer it with uh angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping
well funny you should mention that
that is my opinion yeah um
right
uh but it is it is it is a glorious movie  um and i like as you know these these these vocalized noise silly  silly movies
they do it by like a bunch of men have guns and one of them_n has the real gun in it so they do not know who killed
they are real good
no businesses um if
yeah do not blame her
and
my husband likes to read sports and fishing magazines all the time that is pretty boring to me 
well everybody is known  has known theyi have needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it
and i usually work teach at night and my wife was here in the daytime and i mean at night and then i was here most of the day if they were when they were here so
where you start getting into {mils} and that sort of thing and then some of them are are done in uh you know purely metric
oh i like that one and um
need to go face this group of twenty five or a judge wapner like you know that they have on tv and let
and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also
being in the business ii have sold guns for twenty seven years i am  fifty two years old and ii have sold guns for twenty seven years worked for some major manufacturers like winchester and people like that and
uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
i do not have such  such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do
give the attitude that well you know you are the last one hired so you will be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and we do not really care about you as an individual when youi have got that type of attitude on the people do not care about their work and so
well we went to a uh cat show at the plano center here in town and uh we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we would want something kind of unique so
um hum real close new mexico anyway
we are more involved in that now and i i
what uh
yeah i think they are about the same i you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind
yeah i ii have vocalized noise ii have seen uh they are they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths
kind of medical thing that like  like england has but more of a um noise national insurance uh sort of clearinghouse or whatever i think that uh
you know uh
that is true well do you do anything else  do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that
you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that
yeah christmas time i can understand but what my after i got one i did not just stop i got ii have got about five
restoration to his home i think that was called back because of all the flack they received but but that is the another one of the big examples of
uh huh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that
it is funny that i got you though
meets by and large certain standards for
but when i do fish i do contact uh some of the local specialists
oh i was gonna say cause i wondered if you really you know if you had any teams you like watching from up north or something
i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think we are lacking in some very specific areas
and it all prints out up to five generations per child  and you know you can select the child and get the whole thing  i think it is just as neat as it can 
i think i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest and i think as as parents
 i do not know it is it is hard for me to listen  listen to it in true light anymore since ii have heard it so many times um i mean i ca not  i mean i want to throw up usually when i hear it  anymore i um
but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that is always kind of bothered me
how about if it was uh a seventeen and a half year old with a a list and all uh of vocalized noise what do they call it uh criminal vocalized noise
you know a summer job and to spend your dollars and uh have fun and everything
those classes i i enjoy uh i think uh
and all right not not a friend a cousin
um yes yeah we just had salmon last night for dinner uh but also the spices here um old bay is a spice i do not know if you are even aware of it it is what they used on the
oh no huh uh yeah its uh a stand alone single family home i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up
yeah huh wow so they evacuated it 
i mean just the very second it is really strange they uh they must uh
and so he saw it there and he just said you guys want to make some money and talk five minutes a day here you go so
ireland and england wei have been to germany twice but um i guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland
and we have um three teenage daughters and you know they are very expensive so um noise uh we yeah we have somewhat of of a system um
certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um
it was amazing
uh it means that youi have got to be informed and youi have got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
and it really is not for some people that  who have been there uh for over and over and over it really is not uh as bad  i mean there it is not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect
that i mean it  it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because um
uh {antisupporters} i guess for lack of better term
noise well not really uh we are doing the same thing tying it in with my husband is business trip and i just save vacation for things like that and uh just travel whenever we can
um i mean the the environment there i do not know too much about it but it it seems
um because the the the waitresses have no control over the the way the dishes are and cleaned in the kitchen and if they are not cleaned off well when they go threw the dishwasher food just does not always get washed off and it sticks on there and then when they dry them
yeah but vocalized noise our prescriptions and everything our visits to the doctor our hospitalization the only thing we pay for is if if something happened emergency and we had to have an ambulance it is twenty five dollars
uh but on the other hand i am  not sure i would have gone otherwise and having gone
i do not know ii have ii have been a few times but that is something i am really bad  i mean you know 
they may not raise it
yeah yeah um they were not i think they were early twenties they were young men
okay uh right here in colorado springs where i live
given by the court system but vocalized noise i do not know with the economy the way it is i think crime ca not do much but go up
now i i also liked uh oh gone with the wind or some of the classic like the lawrence of arabia
those old little ten minute jobs where the uh the real ballooned looking art work you know and  and
they want it over with and they want the person punished and punished properly
well i can imagine it seems like the
yes i live in northwest garland right up there near the golf course
uh for the and so you on that it is not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on an on a
they actually are forced to take time off and pick an area of study it is proctored it is you know regulated and all that sort of thing um but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own thing on a particular subject and it does not matter what it is
at a time when maybe i would have uh the the uh freon checked in the air conditioner or maybe topped off
oh i will be darn
oh i mean i do not  i i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that it is hard to justify being i do not understand how our government can can encourage drug testing and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like they are testing the same sort of nebulous
okay i pressed the button so
yeah well ii have been over there too i even noise let is see um noise mostly germany and france i lived in france for a year and a half so
they do not want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which that is that is what recycling at home sorting does you know i mean it is a little extra work and uh
something along the lines of fifteen thousand forty fives he has every top forty single
i think inherently our the the chance that we are gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack the united states
i guess we bought that my car in colorado that is where we we moved from and uh
 yeah i am  sure they will i mean with uh the way things are going i mean uh it is going towards a more green
settled in eastern texas where the green rolling hills are and and when they finally beat the mexicans the mexicans said fine you can have east texas but long  as long only as long as you take west texas too 
oh sure yeah
now that i am  alone why uh i uh prefer to travel overseas if i am  going anywhere
well um
it is it is a situation that because i did not have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county
 yeah really
yeah what do you like
no you can start 
you know a lot of things like that that really is  are hard to plan for and uh
i think you are right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too
yeah ii have uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh mercedes and
yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the rangers will go up a little bit
you know i look at my daughter and she is now uh four going to be four and i keep saying oh jeez i do not have that much time with her 
well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances so
noise i mean it does not seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
especially with the relationship wei have started to develop with saudi arabia after the gulf war and all noise and i do not know maybe we could use that to our advantage noise
well that too that too and uh you know they talk about the army and because of the war and why did we win and all that and they talked about how the training was so important and that is so important in industry so
no they match the same amount yeah well they match four percent which is the same you know fifty percent or four percent
moved down from south dakota in july
and i was really worried about it raining because it its has been there been some dark clouds and it is been pretty rainy looking
it is um at purdue i am  trying to think i went to high school in chicago i am  trying to think what purdue kids watch
the uh yeah that is a pretty good price and they are they are they are they are so  so nice to drive uh
uh ii have got three children at home two vocalized noise fourteen year olds and a twelve year old
sleek i guess for wind resistance you know and and uh they just do not look like they are roomy inside i guess they are i have not been looking at them to
we would no longer need paper at all
is that
i i mean i would not stay in the um
um but if that is the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that
  they  must  because_n  i  do not  know  where  they are  going
yeah i do i do i work and and uh brian is in a day care center he is uh he was two in december so he is not quite two and a half yet he uh i put him i am 
yeah saturday night live has changed a lot if you have not seen it in about a year
well i was in the band there i uh was part of the spirit of the campus for a long time and uh it just we have a section of band alumni that all sits together called the diamond m club we just we get the same season tickets every year and so we are uh
yeah yeah
no i do not think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer
yeah that is that is what i would always heard ii have um
well i know what you mean it does look impossible you look around you and i do not know how young people buy houses today or anything i really do not know and
no there is no way somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i ca not work on it you know theyi have gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh
right and you could picture it as being russia versus the us during  during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them
right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that did not walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the um three three year olds
and so you would see  i i feel that the cost would increase
he did not know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing i mean he could not even check the oil i mean that is that is how uninformed he was and disinterested
and uh they have a a child that is five years old and it is really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i am  sure that will
 six years
together and uh so personally  lot of the hobbies that i had when i was growing up um in going to college and so forth are have changed
but we work in an electronics field and we have to wear polyester smocks so it is usually um a tank top in the summer and then silk and polyester are the only things that are close enough to being dressy
um yeah i do not just do not see it changing my life style a whole lot
with whether it is gonna work or not you know
um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the streets even would would um make people do it
that was absurd  there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
they are not owning homes period
uh the yeah the movie the in field field of dreams came out after uh that novel
and the view that i would  rather take is that
twenty seconds yeah that is all it takes i mean it is just a button that is it you you release it right at the top so you do not have to get out or anything
that that ti would not want to have liability for that and i can understand that i work in the legal department i do not want anymore lawsuits than what we got 
but it is just it is just that uh you know it  you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know it is like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately
  every  time  the  sun  would  come  up in the morning i would see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh wei have learned we are we uh
but in the winter it it is gets pretty cold
yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there is just things all you can do is put it in words you ca not put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you could  say what is this
see never no vegetables in my family
look look through uh i have one now and i  i ca not remember the name of it that i that i got is the sister in law in chicago usually sends me for my birthday or or christmas or something will send me another another good book and
and uh we we we ourselves are into the wok cooking you know they been advertising that and wei have really been enjoying those uh meals
i do not  i do not know what uh you know times have changed but
yeah a little bit just got through snow skiing  yeah just came back from denver but
so i i am  wondering if the peace corps is really an effective tool
i mean you about_n have to expose the
that work noise outside and and they have a even tougher noise time trying to noise uh schedule time with noise their families
noise i get a charge out of uh texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh
ii have never had that happen to me either what do you think about for instance like i was in michael is the other night and charged something and they asked for
and i mean they look today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us and there is a ring and you buy a present
and now it is for all employees they uh randomly select employee numbers and uh the day that they select you is when you have to go and and be tested so we are familiar with it
it was not that childish you know what i mean it was not my daughter is five i mean she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except you know r rated and uh
and over time she uh uh finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle
it was written i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety one so it is a brand new book yeah uh huh yeah and he really this man really shed some light on um
well see they have that um uh what is it a vet test or something like that they call it
but with somebody that needs around the clock care i have seen my family age
countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money
and not get the career politicians huh
oh yes we have brick on the outside and uh it the colors that were there changed the and the colors we painted changed the entire look of the house completely
that that actually alaska just recently legalized marijuana
and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that my neighbor across the street has one he always uses it to dethatch his lawn i see him out there and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it yeah yeah
i am  building our house right now and i am  going to incorporate into my uh garage area a weight activated uh crusher
fill ins you know 
you know that is a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh
well i hope so yeah sounds good
and so uh but but you  but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that
right and see that is my only problem with uh making you um
and then it is got your aerobics room which is coed and then it is got the female side which has all their nautilus that they can use by theirselves and their own sauna
ninety five is wild in any car there is no doubt about that
you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much of  other types of benefits and
like the ninety degree
so everything everything else is mud
yeah exactly you ca not charge more for a person who is on a flight just because they are larger yeah noise
the news yeah
yeah yeah
have you seen the rest i think ii have missed one i am  not sure but i think ii have missed one
and uh it wo not be too far from where we live and everybody really has been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we do not want one any place 
noise so um are you working right now
so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against
noise of course my dad is a big sailor so he likes to sail and he likes to do all that stuff but it is been a long time since he is had a boat
whatever the case may be and sometimes that is not real fair either though so
oh certainly not
uh yeah she used  she used to collect them from everybody in the department she would go up and down with her little bag  collecting from everybody
and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i do not have the time to devote to that
yeah so do i but baseball is still
and i get mail
handicraft type things
right yeah
pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with easter  and spring break with the kids i um
i believe that not only should you be fired you all of your assets should be given over to the government
 well you know my mother is a waitress and she has like three uniforms that she sort of wears in rotation and she likes that you know
ii have got a um noise a great recipe for cheesecake
right married
oh yeah um well right now we um start our seeds inside
which means that if you have a good year winning one run  one run games that the following year
oh do not say that
i can imagine
oh okay
yeah that would do it
um seventy percent your child is life
and i and i and i am  saying to myself well you know you  you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place and they do not pay very much
as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope it is still you know hard to say that what youi have heard is what really is
in terms of the long term effect effect on on america in terms of the culture and everything i do not know um
i would that is a whole pleased with the practice  practice that is they i uh i do not you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand
but i think um like three out of the four
it there is a way to recycle everything and and um if your husband just retired then ii have got to believe that youi have got to be old enough to remember that back during the wars hey recycling was the thing to do i mean you did not
you know always you know my kids smarter they know about  guns it wo not happen to them it may not happen to their kid but it will happen to the neighbor who does not understand it and happens to come by and visit noise
but she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart and she is already reading and writing and stuff like that and she just turned five last month
i know like what you just said um purdue had to had to uh
i do not think much of life  of life imprisonment first of all it is never turns out to be life but second you know why should we
oh yes
you must well uh  it it must be quite a bit hotter down there is not it
yeah yeah because_n by the time and you save them_n and squish them_n and
that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories
every night this week so i have concentrated on watching james bond movies  this  week 
yeah yeah my place you get two weeks when you start and then every every year they give you an extra day until youi have got four weeks
for example i have a brother in north carolina and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible
yeah well we have a lot of trees that that go across our front yards that are very old that must have been like where the line was in between the fields so we have couple of huge trees out front that is pretty nice no trees really in the back
for former right right we  we can say the the the the soon to be former uh commonwealth of independent states instead is that
noise that is true  certainly not localized there 
yeah that is true
than you sure than it when you were younger uh huh it  it it is with kids we do not care if they take a shower everyday with kids we do not care you know uh
uh huh is that locally
yes ma'am
yes i was just talking to my son today he is up in boston and it was twenty nine there and it was you know in the seventies out here and it was really uh  he really wished he could be  here rather than there
sooner or later
and it is grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my my husband is uncle owns a big  some acreage in a eastland texas which is in west texas
yeah you can get the
and um then it does not bother me very much
they are not serious they are more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so i am  not i am  more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but
that are going to uh do pretty good i think
shoot the one that wrote uh wuthering heights
so the winters would get fairly cold the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would
uh the show that preceded it home improvements all these television shows which reach the american people are beginning to reflect new attitudes and those
but uh wei have got a wei have got a couple of different things uh places uh they are like unattended
uh my two girls i use to take them with me when when uh we would go fishing you know and my wife and i use to like fishing off the pier and stuff and we would catch uh shoot one time she she caught a couple of sharks off the pier
well let is see they take out in state and federal taxes i think i pay
but um
yeah but on the other hand you know if
because he is salary and i am  not i make as much as i earn
how interesting ooh
right
but uh like i said otherwise you know a the  the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we had not did it ourself
because_n i finished one
what i saw on the news today that buechele  buechele was back just to visit
but the deposits only on like drink stuff
that is not too bad vocalized noise the golden retriever is are good dogs too they are kind of like get that
i am too young yeah
noise a nice meal oh
uh huh that is worse yet 
out of nowhere and then they are gone wei have had some with
and he was lethargic he really he was not used to the heat at all he
that is funny
uh and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure
five okay he is written some children is books as well and they are all spiritually uh oriented yeah
to get out there and do so
and uh my husband liked it
have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we
and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now ii have gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me ii have ii have uh
oh 
well uh let is see
somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that i think that is true
oh it is  it is it is a lot of fun especially  especially if you can find somebody that is uh that is got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that is  that is that is true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or
yeah yeah it is frustrating
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that but anyway my mother is side noise
but they uh they might even  get  a  little  carried  away you know with the lobbying and and whatnot but
yeah that and i know that is a big issue because i i belong to a women is forum group and some of the questions we are getting are are on site day care and things like that that
i guess a pumpkin  a squash plant you know turned out to be a pumpkin and uh it it bore pretty good size fruit and then one year we just let one of the squashes grow out it produced a really huge pumpkin
but you do not have anything right now
did you go down to williamsburg have you been down there
from the times herald is doing a a fax sports column 
well we vacation a lot how about you  quite frequently 
no he had full run of the house  he just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the hair  the heat came up out of the dryer you know it was he was really a neat pet and though i
no  no who did what yeah because_n it is you really have to be dedicated we would like tape it and send the kids to bed say okay now we can watch this because_n you have to watch every scene to kind of figure out what it is doing and it
so youi have got youi have got a modem in it then
yeah exactly
oh are you really where is it going to be
the home is the key i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um that  the main goal is making money now
in uh um noise a workplace
well yeah and
she will be sixteen in may
and uh they could spend more time with their kids because they look back and you know they are all like
where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the hoover administration i do not have a real since
and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles could not take it anymore
noise that is the same way out here because_n um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds washington
any of the tv commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had uh pictures of bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and
uh huh what is her name by the way
a uh special effects man who somehow gets involved in this um
uh a tent of some sort but they are really expensive like the good ones
is that right well here yeah even  even uh even just putting uh little uh uh patio outside you have to have a permit
uh yeah yeah uh i work in metal fab
now i am  not even familiar with what that where that is
you know appliques on t shirts and you know that kind of fun stuff and and i make a lot of christmas gifts too
i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh it is it does not it is not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing
better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and
yeah now oh yeah and then you never use the vcr and now we have two of them_n and now it is like we are just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we would not use  it
 yeah well seventh floor
later on that afternoon  that afternoon evening it was just it was horrible
oh i see that is fine um i think uh that is pleasurable for all of us  if we vocalized noise choose the right restaurant
decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it persia and part of it uh iraq and part of it something else you know and they they split things along um
uh oh the college town nearby when i am  in stillwater which is about an hour away but the fm signal does not reach this far
excellent food
yeah i do not know that that is true for me because i lost all that weight that i lost without ever exercising i had not started exercising and i lost thirty pounds but
and still i want to get up early in the morning and walk before this knee business and my husband
and  and then i did not  i did not like the things  uh the things that were going on when we had desert storm and stuff like that you know basically i  i  i think they do not present the
but in the middle of the day they do not just drown you with the same old stuff and they wo not interrupt unless it is you know really important
well very well um it is slow though i think  at least they are making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and
here in new york it is a lot harder than that uh it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state
noise leslie french
uh any limbs or any extra trash that you might have
i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient um kind of takes away
that is excellent advice
do not affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
 yeah  yeah
a pretty scary thought to me even
oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook
you know uh far  far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them_n effectively and everything
so um
no it could be
gee whiz
oh really
and uh you know it was a real hush hush thing and then i was i was wondering why my mother always referred to you know his second wife as that hussy 
of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i am  concerned and fact is we are going to take a vacation this year we are going to go to new orleans again and uh
uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide um
had to goshen college which is in indiana
yeah in fact i we were there from uh seventy three to seventy seven and i was i worked for the little the weekly newspaper there the the the plymouth  plymouth um oh what was it called crier and uh
really doing great this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it is just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible
i really do now i uh they sometimes they jump on it and  and and go a little to the extreme the media does but
oh that would be a shame
it is uh you know it all starts to become similar there is you know there is benefits and there is things that were not as good but as an overall package i would say i i am  pretty happy so far with the way it is turned out
you know even if the case is open and closed they go all the way up to the supreme court you know
and uh we just had not expected it we were used to what uh uh gulf coast uh weather was like and we came here to pacific coast weather it is just completely different and it is much nicer
oh is that right
sometime you can but on some things it is
no i do not think so i would not think yeah i  north  far north dallas  yeah about a half a mile from plano  so we are in the
i mean you do not feel you should have paid somebody to do the same job you did anyway
and  and that is unreal because_n wei have got people out here that are just noise poverty level but then we got these million dollar homes so you know where do you find a happy medium and how does your salary deal with that it is not it is just not doing it
noise no no i do not i just do not have any 
then that is a good thought
yeah yeah well i guess  maybe i am into some things occasionally that i do not think of in terms of self improvement
fine you for it shit  it is kind of like
in day cares and in mother is day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids
well i  i do not know ii have get ii have gotten the chevelle ii have did done the brakes all the way around it myself and uh
oh it is national
because i mean there are some i mean i like  there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i would not i would not say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know it  and it is the same way with world  you know world music takes
uh i did not really look at american cars uh had a couple bad experiences with american cars
noise well it is similar to that but it is dow jones which is um the wall street journal is news wire
yeah ii have heard some good things about that car actually
if anything happens interesting in the war maybe they will have another thing and we will get you again all right bye
and every time you
but uh even now i would i would like to not have to work in some ways it it is kind of pull and tug on the other hand
one that i have enjoyed and had the privilege of eating there new year is eve night was the marriott on six thirty five at coit
noise well what i believe is  one of the major problems  uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough
no i  i um i transferred to delaware and graduated there
not a great deal of that
well uh  you wear uh shoes with good traction and vocalized noise and and try to remember where you are at all times 
bryn mawr stereo dealer um but
yeah i  i  i have i mean you say that your your kids are grown up and out of school now and ii have yet to have any so
right well i my husband and i always felt that if you want to keep them off the street so to speak that if they are involved
it is gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh
i i mean as i said well  well  basically all ii have done is go back and forth to parents and uh
groups and they had an interesting time there
where that you ca not get a fence that is high enough and a security system that is good enough
we have a lot of uh
noise did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish that is it 
huh that is interesting
yeah so
well i love to fish i have not in the last few years but uh in fact
well
let is see
yeah
and drive through woodland park and
yeah so you know i really have to try to budget that i do not go over that amount you know each month
yeah gm uh chrysler announced that they are going to they are well they actually have an electric minivan
same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh like aids tests and such
ten ten would be no regulations at all let is see no wait how was it
yeah i sang at one last summer um it was my first wedding ii have done um little commercials and background singing and
yeah i am  keeping v eight v eight chevy engines because that is what i know and in fact i stock the same part i am  like a little stock if you brought your chevy to me i could i would probably have some parts for it right now you knows
well vocalized noise course there is only a a  tremendous number of refrigerators and freon  excuse me refrigerators and freezers
hm well last year it was buffalo and i  i still try to keep up with buffalo because_n they just they just impressed me as being so efficient and noise they never score they never
now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax
well basically i like uh comedy shows 
you know yeah you have more control  control  over  it  it  seems  almost  like  it is  taking  control  here
well  i think it is about five or ten percent of that you know it does not even it is not even noise
i do not know what you want to call them fake
it is so good
you know to go from you know nothing you know if you want to do something every night that is fine but when you have children it does not work that way anymore so
i thought about it a lot 
um jeff bridges and karen allen or nancy allen you know with  short nerdy guy with glasses he is
would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera and so forth and and i kept pushing her towards
i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh like i said some years ago i think i would have said there is no place for capital punishment in the
type thing
my you know i  i do not exactly appreciate that either i really get frustrated when government starts to do things that are immoral and then expect me to support them on it
uh just the about two years now yeah yeah so
it was not a good week i was pretty mad
yeah well if  if if the  if the interface is there so that it is like fun to use and the challenge i think you know for a lot of kids that 
um but my wife is has a real job yeah and what she will yeah  so what we do is we take money out of her out of her paycheck each week
a lot of desperate people whereas i think probably fifty years ago the crime was not quite so intense that way vocalized noise
uh this thing they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the
do without and that kind of stuff where it is now the credit cards and
winter um now south of here uh like in houston i did even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in houston it was winter
and we have had just wonderful luck with ours i mean it is we take it everywhere it  it is been it is  it is  it is so easy to get the kids in and out see my car was also a two door
noise course it was designed for most of us to go about forty five miles an hour because the short on ramps and arf /off off ramps but noise gosh seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet i hopefully the new ones will be a lot better
you know you are trying to support uh four kids and it is pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids
conviction and carrying out the penalty that i do not see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody
and yeah that is
oh they  well they they make you they do not make you feel at ease but ii have come to the point where i know that i am  the one they charge and that they ca not you know
and using up all my nighttimes and weekends
our health care keeps increasing increasing increasing and not to the same rate as our pay 
my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles
seventeen years on death row
they had that we came back what day was that
noise my second consideration would be uh
where where are you oh yeah
some uh sausage hors d'oeuvres and uh
i see
and now uh it is pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
sure it was fun
bohemian  bohemian  bohemian rhapsody yeah that that was great i heard that the other day on the radio and i pumped it up
yeah now the last time i bought a calculator i bought one from texas instruments
well i think i do not know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes
sure and that is all part of your  of keeping your part of the relationship you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues
nothing they can do about it
well the thing of it is if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh
the the iranian borders are still open uh from what i understand  understand um
noise oh i do not know i guess they are you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated
that would be funny
unless they have the lord that has done that to them_n
we all are so
and uh
um sort of on a peripheral she is an annuity  annuity  annuitity/annuity administrator and so she uh she works for an insurance company but but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff and uh
the time  that is  the  hard  thing i have finals right now because i am  taking two classes i have finals and papers and stuff so in um two weeks from now i should be pretty well set
and thoroughly read a newspaper as a matter of fact i read the sunday paper this evening we had such a busy day yesterday
yeah that is right
is not that neat
uh huh we are
um i imagine and and that is nice but uh it is would  it is also nice to be able to uh
is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for noise whether it is a loving and caring place or not and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that
uh at uh it is tcjc texas  tarrant county junior college yeah and it is really it is really enjoyable i like it
well and i still think having lived in europe for awhile you know noise the difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it
uh huh
well that is too bad a sixty seven chevrolet  uh mustang is about the uh top noise top year for the mustang  car
you know maybe know what the
uh a great deal of change as far as um
right yeah we are just so much wealthier and uh and uh there has to be resentment built up and that is where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises
that is really interesting
um hum that is true i i like i say i do not have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it is just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one
and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it is it is done pretty well in winter uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably do not wanna be driving anyway
now i work and i live in the city so
yeah wayne is world hey man  
but you know it is in the bleachers way out in the you know center field but it is still nice you still can see well
then you uh pour that in there you know to make the gravy
well uh we always vocalized noise this last oldsmobile we bought uh it is an eighty seven but we bought it in eighty eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them
so what is your opinion on on drug testing
yeah vocalized noise
it is not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for
he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion
and that program is designed to uh
uh which group are you saying is the one trying
well it was within oh
uh huh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green it is
and you are the minority and you are stuck with it
oh that sounds good we we were from north carolina and we had a garden and my mother would would uh grow the squash and she would grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of
oh yeah yeah it is it
of the second one
 yeah  got  to  see  them  all  the  time
but then they are they are also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals so somehow you know it does not really balance out too much
fringe benefits are very important in the company  in the company i think to provide the employee with a sense of security
that is true until they get over that hump of whatever it is they are dealing with
oh just all kinds of things that are kind of unusual
right
totally  totally vested and they have the nnnk and the usual benefits like that uh
 okay well good talking to you good night
not  not even a ged was required
you know going through this routine which is lousy
oh i have one of those yeah mine is broken at the moment but 
a lot of people do not realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and
i have not had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having ii have got an an olds tornado that i think is got six belts on the sucker and i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh
right yeah
um let is see well  um this is almost sort of funny i was just at um
um hum noise ii have been up there i thought i mean i like canada i we where we came from when we came back here was minnesota and uh it is beautiful it is just too darn cold
sure i suppose you watch for hurricanes  hurricanes coming in and
yeah yeah it gets to be a bit much before  noise haul it off but
you know and that you know and for portraying bush as a strong president
okay uh things have become much more enlightened since then
yeah if you implemented  implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what
i know there is a lot of them_n
okay now i have got some daffodils
and since ii have had the car ii have bought a new battery ii have i had a noise a fan belt pulley go out and the universals in the drive shaft
now i understand that um the the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
um hum um hum
oh it does
did you
and there is a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama
yeah they have excellent lasagna and if you get like spaghetti with uh get with the italian sausage it taste like home made italian sausage you would get in chicago
no should i rent it should i go rent it tomorrow 
yeah noise one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year
to go along with it and do the best job we can if we are called it is a duty a lot of people i know try to get out of jury duty when they are vocalized noise you know and i would never do that because i feel like hey we live in a country
the only thing i object to is like uh machine guns
so on next night i spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there
oh i see right
that would be a an an interesting ways yeah
and uh it is kind of these intervention programs now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that is socialism and that is communism and that is you know and then it gets political
you know you get your little sousa book and you just flip  through  it  and  that  sort  of  thing
doing uh anything from you know bagging concrete for a pad or uh you know i did uh couple of complete remakes of a house you know tore down and started over  almost on one of them_n
common problem common problem 
right but
it is true it is true i agree with you so it is really neat
 she enjoyed it huh  well there is a a woman in our choir who is almost  nearly famous for her apple pies and uh we had a
oh well then you could go either one the spring creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more
um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in dc come home very quickly
uh well it is actually um waste water taking taking care of uh i am  actually in the air division and we monitor um
yeah i was down at about_n four or five quite awhile ago it is probably up there to twenty now if if i was ever to start again
and the result is a lot of people wo not provide it at all or over charge
and uh they are susceptible to rotting and so when there is too much water they die and that is that is what really kills them is the too much water
the thing the thing that that uh that i saw was okay iraq wants to raise oil prices kuwait wants to take iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent
well you are from indiana yeah you oh real southern yeah uh huh
i used to take smithsonian too and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it you get so many coming in and
that uh mother russia is that much of a threat to us any longer
oh it is not bad at all
that is great
noise my uh
on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i am  not really sure if it is true or not that uh we are not spending
yeah you can you can
five dollars a call noise gosh i wish i could do that  we ca not get paid for  it
yeah would that we could 
uh i do not think that would be any great loss  we could do without a few of  those they do not seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people
well i agree with you i think we have a lot of talk but not dollars and you know we we situation  noise our situation where
yeah i i i know a lot of the things that that we wear men wear now a days were wouldi have been considered uh feminine uh many years ago
yeah definitely some good and some bad 
yes
but uh i have uh all my children are grown now and they have their children in day care one one of them_n keeps her child with a noise with a relative though
everything is not always somebody else is fault you know you have to watch where you are going  and and so it is what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her
this same child um really listened to  to more um {ballady} or um
if you are to say okay we have to get rid of them_n all because you know they can only they only seem to do bad it it is um it is saying we are too
um hum
yeah what do you do
twosome or threesome you know they are always friendly sure come on out you know and they do not mind if you make a mistake they do not mind saying well you know let me teach  tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
and um you know call  call my own days call my own hours and
um is a mess  um uh i think one of the biggest things we have to worry about is the uh control of nuclear arms especially ukraine and russia
and like  now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it is just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i do not like that so
a young adult in the family just about
um there is not really any place up in the garland or richardson area that i like to go that i you mean that ii have found that is not real expensive
the majority of people that live in this area go into dallas to work and and
so it is uh  it is  nice  but but i know how it is if you are gonna take care of texas you have to live in texas i suppose
you can just blow them_n off and that is not good but i know lot of people do it
i know 
 that is right i ii have never caught that much but uh
i you  you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it it i think so um the question you know i mean it is it is it is handy to have them_n i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um
and they do not have a waiting period
you face the same uh uh bureaucratic uh headaches whether you work or do not work so  and so now theyi have you know so really it must be uh really traumatic time for the people as well as the uh
i listen to uh
and and i  i just sort of think that is ridiculous yeah with
um hum cans are the only thing i think you really get money for
who had had uh apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating and uh he had apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so but when they brought  the family came in to see him
well i ii have also been thinking about after looking at all these magazines um these design magazines and stuff i am  thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of um
back when like the pistons were in them_n and now where are you calling from oh we are
but on the other hand i am  kind of getting fed up with uh our own country and presidency ah always vocalized noise concerning themselves
so you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually do not need subs because everybody is pretty good about coming in
m x three uh nissan is whatever their two n x two thousand
is to die for i bet ooh
if i had a child that that did things so bad it is not they do not care about anybody these people they are stealing from they are just the big bad rich guy
um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution
go camping on the long weekends uh memorial day fourth of july labor day
and and we put twenty eight hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars and you know it is right i mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in but but we also
we we do not we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it is kind of cumbersome when noise in reality it makes things much much easier
oh absolutely without a doubt um hum
yeah yeah ii have got some friends that are lawyers so
but i am  like you i came down from colorado and there was more land up there around the yard
it would be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing
well i know that noise from a personal standpoint people
and uh ii have learned how to crochet but i do not really know i mean i do not do it that much not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather is really bad i would rather be outside
strategic planning committee for my school and um one of the
that is true that is true they uh in  in fact uh also i do not know if you are familiar with the japanese method of of dealing with crimes
yeah and and um the doors are pretty good too i can listen to them and the who i  i really like all kinds i
oh i ca not think of it now
drawback i can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result
yeah well we vocalized noise we we got on it um a long time ago but then it was down so much of the time you kind of got out of the out of the habit
that money is put into each month
uh <b_aside> give me five minutes vocalized noise <e_aside>
yep all over
you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the decision  making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that
no when my son was at home i i did work and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about uh five other kids that she baby sat
but um you know that is been a new thing in the last few years and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others i think those uh
noise yeah really
and of course car and driver ii have got two  two teenage boys that are in the market for a car so we ii have been trying to teach them how to read for what is a good deal and what is to to get as far as insurance costs et cetera
um just  just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children
yeah i ii have never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family
that stage in their life uh other people it uh it is
 yeah it is weird 
and then they um you know then they let you know you write in and they let you know later on what the results  general results were throughout the united states
well i the cost is something but it is i think it is relatively unimportant compared to
it is just i do not know only time will tell whether it is better or worse than the way we grew up but uh it is it is just very different um
and uh that is not the idea it is the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime that he committed but to punish him for the crime he committed
we laid the i did get some material noise and studied every bit of material that i could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of sand  sand
yeah i  i used to be a builder
i have been working at uh as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas and i have watched um
yes uh huh that uh lots  lots of new uh newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens
um especially after if it is after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness
i do not know that may or may not be uh a useful choice but i do know that there are a great deal of young people out there who would say why do i want to go
concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be
see and i do not either so and i do have friends my brother is a lifelong member of the nra  so it is fun you know it is um but it is just a belief you know i guess we all work towards um what we think will make it a better society
but i you know we have been really fortunate our family has not had noise
areas in which ti stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that
goodness
inflation is out of this world and the governments which
uh compares to how we feel what is the laws there in dc
you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you would have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together
and i do not watch tv as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i am  at work sometimes i on the computer network um
um not really my uh my parents are divorced and my father uh is dating a woman who has a two year old boy and uh
it is okay for us to go expend our
for instance or public improvements and today there
and brighton and yes all those areas so i imagine have you skied before
that type of show but we like l a law we like that we are just i am  sorry they are breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there
the the social the other social problems would not would not go away
it was really interesting
on on clothing and stuff uh i know
theyi have got these on it is it is county wide program now and what theyi have done is theyi have broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash
gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there
why i should say i i have listened to some others that i like that i ca not remember their names offhand my husband makes all these tapes of all different artists and i never know what i am  listening to
yeah well youi have got old meathead there and the rest of the gang at the where meathead and and sally  sally struthers there with the um the the liberals
um and uh i i gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh
oh my gosh
noise you know it seems to me like the minute you starting putting in any radical changes in anything you end up with something like um liberia or  uh czechoslovakia you know i mean it seems like
just to pack the bearings
uh huh so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to
too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they are in the the news or something but um so i tend to listen to some of the older
i mean that is nothing compared
be well i  i think i would feel the same way i would i would really feel like i would been deceived you know that that was not the thing to do
 and we have two cats
you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work
forty two percent
the way you were mentioning yeah
yeah i know the cities are um i think dekalb
he went wild you know i mean because
exactly now that just was not fair
you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real um higher ups like the the lawyers  the ti lawyers and uh
wow why is that do you know i mean
about um twenty five twenty six years ago my brother in law showed up in my front yard pulling a trailer and in this trailer he had a pony
well that certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things
got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
really
they they just had the uh season finale and i do not i do not know what they accomplished but i think the writers just
well that and the and the economy is so bad and
uh are into themselves more than they are into you know doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which  which is really unfortunate
kids that are bored like you say
he wanted to direct it he wanted to act  to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really wanted  he really wanted it whether it
lots of wildlife huh yeah
yeah i bet 
i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and ii have never seen another bill so i  i have to say it really works but again
i am  not crazy about sweets but i really have a passion for cakes any kind of cake i  i really like chocolate cake and um apple cake
hi my name is leslie
oh uh huh
you  you well let is think about water freezing and pipes breaking but down there they got all those crops to worry about
they will they will put it with just my wife loves old bay with everything so if we have french fries they have to have  they have to have old bay on them
which uh or should never have gone to court
i thought it was the other way around they were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that they are sort of use to it it is been sort of like you know
oh that is too bad i think the you know there is certainly a lot of aspects you would like but maybe not the you you know the canada men is trip but some other you know a nice tent on the the shore of a lake and
yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think
okay if i was having a dinner party noise i would probably um noise have some um some uh um
get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while
 yeah they do not have to submit to drug testing like like they do here in the states and some places abroad
especially where theyi have had uh extended family and i and and  i i kind of see that that you know perhaps
and it is just a big big tourist attraction there is the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops and
and i think theyi have had it for several years and their program they had i do not think had a lot of uh problems
so i am  ii have become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around look to see you know who is selling what and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class and
uh suffer the consequences and and that was enough for them i mean they just were very responsible
is because of the cost of insurance
i do not know i try tell my kids just just kind of be aware of what is around them_n you know and
guarantee quality
with some friends done a
you know i mean you are not totally out of the loop
i think it is sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy car or refrigerator something you would like to get it from some
victoria holt is that right
yeah i mean it 
right they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five you know and they are not doing it again  again you know so well it is certainly uh uh you must be a ti employee
yes uh huh you ready okay
that is {anticommunist} you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro  it do not matter what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the
when it becomes militant or if it is uh violence oriented i i am  i  i really  i have i have strong objections to that um
uh i guess i am  i am  my view of
well  well jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend
yeah we sort of stayed to the topic anyway
uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state
noise so you do not oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost
so is that quality time
so i like things like golden girls or cheers or uh monday night is real good with me you know major dad and and uh uh northern exposure and and uh oh what is that one with burt reynolds
uh huh
vocalized noise all my bills how much i am  going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything
the family grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together it is it is generally you know like say the kids  kids of those people who are not
arrangement for me personally i am  not home a lot i travel a great deal with my job and
mississippi probably does not
and i only need a few more things like a joiner i would like to have and small some smaller things
they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in fall
a large area you know probably probably that is why i get because sometimes boy i will get i will freeze it is so cold in there especially when it is ninety degrees outside
it is not it it is small enough that it is easy to drive
something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops
somewhere in that range
two month break
yeah because when people ca not pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know
who is who is not very well educated
gathered and the program and so forth so i was interested in as i said i was interested in being a speaker
uh to me at least i do not like to go out by myself but that is when we do the most talking and you know about things that have taken place during the day and
uh you know because_n i have a feeling it is and i  i think there ought to be more things added to it uh if you
and if we do that i just tell the credit card company do not pay the charge even though theyi have already paid it but they will just you know undo the credit that they did to them
i do not no uh a friend of mine is dad is was a program manager up there and he just moved down here to mckinney 
um i know that uh
but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them noise focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know
okay fine it is been nice talking with you
uh yeah  right
but my daughter in law is from panama and she has vocalized noise they have uh
i am  from plano texas
okay i uh i have grandchildren and i know uh one has gone to a well two of them_n have gone to preschool and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that why do not you tell me what you have found
that is right that is right
you know had  had  had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view it is really um
um i they actually noise
belief that uh any particular person is life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guy is life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some
both so uh i could say enchiladas down on greenville avenue in dallas texas
uh i am currently taking decorative woodworking and uh country living and let is see we do have national geographic and then we have some church magazines
so
and uh i am  trying to think what else i watch on television {sportswise} i like i like tennis so i mean i am  not i have not played in years but um i just like to watch you know two two players really get go at it on television
they do not mash  they do not compress at all and they stay forever
but actually yeah you have to do it randomly otherwise people will cheat
because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know i i would not have to worry about satisfying my
huh and also we have found that if we write down
tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly
you know you got a computerized test scores with multiple choice because there is no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test or you know a three hundred and three hundred and fifty person short answer test
yeah i know what you mean
no and then i think it is a good turn i do see uh one of the reasons i also believe there is a lot to be ahead as i return to college and uh
but um i find at times
greg norman why
um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh
vocalized noise i really do not know you know in in the uh in you know i hope that what is happening is exactly the way it appears you know some reason or other
that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that
what all do you know about it
well she does not do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she would be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so
to
you wait until they go and get a car insurance and you and that is when they get expensive as they get older you know uh it  it 
yeah that yeah i just came back to find jeans for the little one and it does add up yeah but um
yeah oh yes a mobile home is a heck of a lot cheaper and
if it comes pretty quickly and
when they when they graduate from there
take it back thirty years  i am  going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home
are you a vietnam veteran dudley
yeah that was that was bad news we are still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed them_n
so there is quite a few out there
um hum metropolitan yeah
i think so too uh i know the the group i was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail boy they just really
all that kind stuff 
 you know the freeze  the freeze just got them_n they they were not ready for it at all apparently and and we have not had a typical fall at all no not much color and  you know changes have a color at all
it was not until the last two years um last year my uh they are they are a set of twins um a boy and a girl last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well
no i work in i am  in a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the university of new hampshire
and i wanna play on the beach area too that is what i would do  you  know  i am  just sitting here listening  listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that
um parts do we uh we were over in the  in the western edge in the mountains
well they had a buffet dinner which was very similar 
well their knowledge with uh better communication processes
yeah yeah show biz that is the name of it
and i play in a slightly smaller one called the lockhaven uh symphony and community orchestra
i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the  spending too as well so uh you know i kind of have a handle on it and
and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so i am  going to ii have got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby ii have got is my birds so
oh is it oh i did not realize that okay
no i am  gonna i am  gonna buy it larry i do not like the rental i think i am  getting ready to retire myself and i am  going to i am  going to be you know driving a car for longer so i usually drive a car
well what a what  what do we currently have i have a subaru uh g o x t
and ii have been concerned in the states since ii have been back with the number particularly in the washington area where i live now
well no there is kind of a set pattern to it there is uh so the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually
yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in in a whole lot of areas  because people are of course population is getting older you know
right i think that is the biggest one that is the biggest problem i
um hum um hum and and let the school give them a little more you are right give them_n a little more support and a little more to work with
um which many people uh are lifelong employees of but i suspect that that is not what they had in mind either more of a voluntary kind of thing or uh
right it can take over a small market share but nothing really
well that is that is a system too
i  i do not know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store noise that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there
is that right
and so he always you know was treated like little brother when the band needed transportation they would say oh he ca not drive so
right and that will come i know that day will come and i am looking forward to that too but that is a different phase in my life and i am i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now
well you know it is just like you say there is so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh
we have the things that are extras but it seems that by and large the extras just do not exist
and i would heard it was really good too so
right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by this state  uh uh i do not know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they
we just uh moved my grandfather into
but we made it out to yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that
so it is a little high but but it is you know it is like where he was before i was only paying sixty three so there is quite a little jump there but i looked all over louisville
internal strifes are more important right now than
uh insurance on rental cars and noise and plus they have a pretty good uh
really
uh i keep track of an inventory here and of course now that is where a computer is is very handy
in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i do not know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh
um i do mostly that um not very artistic really for like painting and stuff
uh i work part time and just get uh noise you know my pay does not change noise
as you know the they are allowed to come on site the {federaldes} anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it is a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh
and um noise other than  uh we really
in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it is hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or did not use teflon tape on one or something like that
 well i am  not uh i there really is not any kind of particular food that i i do not do not like really and i like a good italian restaurant or a good uh um
well that is something ii have never had to use it is never ii have never been involved in an automobile accident so
yeah she is not too wild
you know you can you can still get factory original parts
uh yeah actually i think it has i mean they finally like dana carvey and some of those people they really have some funny characters on there
noise your car payments and your gas and stuff
you are like you are like my daughter who is in in college down in massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and she is attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and
you know they take your car and your clothes and your anything that is not the tools of your trade
well the carburetion never really worked quite right and there
and  and anyway leland  leland apparently has hired him on now and  he is and he is defending this case
exactly exactly right
challenges
it was not necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care that the people that work there were very
well did not kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff
and genuinely change it but that does not negate that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person and it is
yes yes we we were  we were all in them_n today but you know when it comes to oops
so i know i mean it is like do not worry about it television at least you know everybody is at least seen television  during the war did you laugh when they had that man on uh what was his name wolf blitzer
and are now now that even though california has reinstated the death penalty
and it is now there is more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and
you wonder why why this happens
noise you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one
yes and now i see and and i see for my daughter which is wonderful noise she is thirteen and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which i think is terrific because
so they say 
i i just look forward to him helping me out because i  i for years just car driven carpools all over the place and
and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean noise it i mean i i i i hardly  i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
right and like i said most of the politicians  the politicians i am  the
uh no i mean i am  not my employer does not do that um although um
my wife was reading in consumer reports i think the week later about the car seats and apparently that is a pretty standard  standard practice
well you know that is interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband is
 yeah i know my husband he will cook every once in a while but like the kitchen is a disaster area afterwards
the real  women libber vocalized noise movement you  know
simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds so
well  i think for  i think one that would be uh
ii have seen the same thing and heard the same things and at the same time ii have heard that it is even harder when both parents are required to work and ca not spend
but uh there is certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer
um hum oh that sounds lovely
it is not like you sit and knit every  night yeah i do not even know  how to knit and my mother used to knit you know all the time and i do not even know  how to  knit  and  i am  like that is a lost art from this  family
oh well we all indulge right
i ended up buying a nissan and i love it
yeah and it it just it just ripped it right 
um i do not think that the parents back the teachers enough any more like with discipline and and such and i think that the um because of that the teachers are starting to lose
and uh so and uh so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i just got through i was planting some some trees out back tonight and uh
and all right what have you seen
no uh no uh no as a matter of fact
first of all i am  gonna to tell you i  i have two little kids but they are not in public school yet i i get i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
i ca not think of what his name is right right off the bat though
usually have them come from vocalized noise you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual 
just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and
and hopefully that they would have their um
so yeah i am  from utah area and the you know we have tons of canyons where the leaves change and they are gorgeous you could spend every weekend of the  fall going to a different area
our vocalized noise our national road system system of highways
and i do a lot of fishing for um bass we have a lot of uh uh couple of lakes in our area that are filled  just filled with good sized bass
 like what for example
and really it is
uh and and uh the but no i probably would not have even though i am  really quite into cars it is it is probably my main hobby
uh who has been harmed you are you you know
i bet
you know it is not that not that hard
i at least what i hear on that one that it is coming out a second time in a
oh i do not know um i  i like reading up on the news um and sometimes i like some science stuff but not much actually so
it is a very clean uh fire extinguisher but it is you know really bad on the environment
uh full coverage for well mother care
well i like them_n because i can read them at my convenience and i do not like a lot of the ads i get in them_n especially those stupid cards that fall out of them all the time
oh i do not know i um
uh what is the last home repair that you did
i think it would in  in israel the even the women are are required to to be in the military for a certain period of time uh i was in the military
i do not know about after accidents because industrial accidents i guess are relatively rare at ti
whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing and seems to me that that is i think that is the way it is done now uh at least
i do not what is brisket
really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path
yeah ii have talked to a lot of people in texas i had one call from  actually from charlotte north carolina and virginia and um
noise uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just used  we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up
i do not get some kind of motivation to learn and
you  you know you  you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon and it is it was selling like at twenty five or something
the starving ones there is enough out there that if you have if you are educated enough then you can make money
but yet the the government that is in moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the us did not go in there and try to save those people
and the phone and we got just strictly by ourselves we uh some of the time we would not allow them_n to take friends along so that it was just the four of us and you know and we could  you  know get back in touch with  each  other
well i have i have very mixed feelings about israel um
yeah they are not they are not by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them_n going it is not good to
i see well that is good to hear
noise but it  it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it so preparing it is a real problem youi have got to prepare it well or else it will flake
um all be together on his  in his immediate family but there were seven children and by the time you get their spouses and their children all there
it is ridiculous i just feel very very disheartened about  about the way i see the building industry go
as it stands there is there is many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a civinal/civil uh civil and criminal case
so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and i recognize that there are good schools out there i mean somebody is getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people
working working for eighteen different companies so
yes sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a czechoslovakian turner society and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and
oh i know we
okay well they did a uh a uh twisted tune they call it and the twisted tune was rap is not music
uh one of our
you know at the wrong time  but
people get together the different backgrounds different ideas that sometimes you can have one person or two that can hold up what i consider the proper sentencing of the person  person
they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um
so so was uh you know two miles a day  to and from work  so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now ii have just bought a new house and i am  a half hour
oh i would
it is through baxter labs tell yeah
yeah we set a record yesterday and uh very  very windy but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so
everyone on the boat
and our other uh two boys they went to clarion also and uh did very well there
right so do i 
let is see the um it is it is different it is kind of it is an action adventure kind of you know
cheers yeah i thought it was good ii have actually been to that bar in boston it is a nice  you know it is a pretty funny show yeah it is kind of a
yeah i i think i am  i am  very lucky um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule
if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
see what is next noise then and i  i usually put the cut up tomatoes next
well he is still in korea and his buddies are home now  he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home
you know republics as a separate country you know so there would be there would be nineteen rather than one
that kind of
well i am a working mother  i have three children and my children since i um since they were very young ii have had various  various um different alternatives child care arrangements and
and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones are not find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it is involves a lot of spread sheet use
it was fairly reasonable too
to say that uh
and you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work you you just you you want to rest for a little while and maybe the children uh do not want you to rest
you know it is like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering
you must be native texan
we have several treaties and several alliances
it was it was dreadful  i ca not even remember what it was now it was something melted but it was just dreadful you know and i i am  i am  i am  horrified but i do not think everytime there is an atrocity committed in the world we should run over there
right yeah no i um i  i have both because that that is what i use all the time is unix systems um versus the dos but then i teach dos classes uh at night uh huh part time so
that is something that is not required and in fact uh
the whites i like are these very okay chardonnays like kessler  kessler and things like that
noise and um it  uh the the question they asked us was what would we buy next that is sort of what i have in mind for the next car that i buy is another celica
i think i would just stick with the classics only because uh
right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by the state  uh uh i do not know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they
oh do you
yeah we have a local  well we have uh dallas morning news which is the big paper in dallas we read it i read it pretty much
what you are planting but uh all the shrubs and
yeah he was like um the the the defense the defense they are were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him and so he he was not you know mentally competent or anything else
 well that is good
city and in the things such as uh you know separating out your glass and your paper now and and uh having the great big you know gallon drums uh uh keeping plano beautiful and and i think that they really do a good job at it too
then i mean all  all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i do not know i mean no one is said for sure you know
um although i am  not a mother i i still think that um a lot has changed since ten years ago
yeah especially  we got two kids that are under two and
um hum i think i have although at the moment  you  i mean i know a little bit about it but
more of that
uh you know just kind of go i guess you could do that you know get all of david carradine is movies or uh um segal to what is his first name
so yeah i am  looking as as a opportunity
oil  vegetable oil but i will use peanut peanut oil or things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um
you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
uh okay okay that makes sense then  i believe
where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground and it is like you know um they live back in where  where we came from two hundred years ago you know wei have  wei have advanced beyond that
yeah yeah my fingers always get get it real bad i hate that i mean i bundle them_n up and everything and and i still get it
yeah right uh well i i think um uh oh
no and it was not like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it is it is pennies but for them it is just a socialized behavior
facilities in the major leagues
my dad lives in the state capital which is pierre and it was filmed right outside of pierre in fact the buffalo the scene the big buffalo herd scene that was that was a live scene
is not that mind boggling goodness it it is it is mind boggling  and well you know i agree with you i know
i checked into the facilities uh the other thing that i did and ii have recommended other people to do the same thing sometimes is to check and with people
um there i mean i mean we are have to be we are alerted there is all sorts of systems where suicide
and so it is uh it is been interesting watching them uh sign up for appropriate course work and things and they are they are on the college bound track at least
and east and well see we have a little knoll on our property about thirty feet tall and it is almost straight up so we will nestle the house right up next to it
yeah well i participate uh you know ii have i have participated since they installed the plan but  uh for a long time i was leery about you know i just could not figure out well what is the deal you know why is the company doing that
it is uh part chow and part shepherd and it as i understand it uh both sides of the were thoroughbreds so she is a genuine {chowpherd}
oh about eight or nine years since we had dental coverage and it sure makes a difference
among industrialized nations we have one of the
square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and just  just showed that you know our obvious  for some reason our property had been valued much higher
uh but i also know that people to me wo not do what they should do to help each other and they would not have so much government if we did
it is uh there is a town called glenrose i think it is around two hours from here and uh it is got  it has like dinosaur tracks
that is interesting that the military saw that and did something about it you would have expected them to be the last ones to
i really keep thinking that t i ought to come up with something like through texins to have you know some kind of facilities there at work because it really is uh a lot of extra pressure on our working parents
less then you lose that money
yeah decorating noise uh huh
uh i have three children and uh it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need
well our libraries and then the uh wal mart stores have the bins in back of them_n and when you recycle glass
close to methodist hospital
so i am  not exactly a real twins fan from birth or anything but
you know ones that really add up after a while i guess you know from  insurance  far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs you know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually
you know i do not so so television is my main news source
to say the least
you were served by maitre d is and and uh um
and
well i know uh on the other hand though when uh after the barry trial up here you know that was a big local trial as well as national
it is um it is just as long as you want to i mean it is just a noise
yeah well families are facing a challenge i know that with i am  a newlywed and we are you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years and
running backs and and defense
and they have a quarter mile track there
and um i am  not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and i am  really sad to say this i never thought i would have but i really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem
if this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh this person is drug test is positive we wo not hire them
that person plus anybody in danger should should be  know about it and be aware of it
is she is predominantly  predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
lamenting about the uh there was a interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles the guy under gates and they were just really coming down on him because of
yeah i usually uh my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course we are the like everybody  like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month you know and uh
yeah so it is terribly engineered 
so and in in this case everyone on the jury felt that it should have been  and they were very convinced the man had no redeeming
and i mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the curve  streets you know just
yes it does it it yeah
right but those are uh still not your favorite huh
yeah where well some people set up towers other people use a fishing line and pull wires up into trees and use wire antennas or whatever  depending on how energetic the club is but uh
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they are too easily swayed by their emotion
or too tired uh i do not i do not  know that i am  too old but i am  too tired to start a third career
yeah well i think that one thing that people do not do a lot of these days a lot of people just live from paycheck to paycheck and do not have enough to put away
yes now you know if if everybody  like in august when everybody is on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual or
i guess not usually  i suppose you are absolutely right there um hum
yeah uh there are not too many right now actually mine are the oldest on our block uh the other ones are at least a year to two years younger so ours is a a block of pretty young kids right now
coils of line into your hand
yeah it is that will be probably the most exciting place i will ever get to go
and then um we do not have a lot extra  extra for extra spending  so it is pretty well  earmarked
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting
how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill
yeah it is it is the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that the parents be able to have a choice saying i do not like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where they will be properly uh
i do uh um i teach a karate class twice a week with with with kids
that is a particularly regressive tax uh it is a tax on the first dollar earnings
anyway
but uh the rest of the time ii have been an  avon lady and a vocalized noise lady 
oh i see
i  i think that is i  think that is the way it is uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh
we are we are i think uh you know in in uh
a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane
now now  they are supposed to they are supposed to be licensed and the um above board
halfway there so that is good
well vocalized noise course there is a a  tremendous number of refrigerators and freon  excuse me refrigerators and freezers
building where there was obviously a crudely uh a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was
oh yeah well yeah he is uh a bad person very definitely
uh what kind of um
and i find that really interesting you know to imagine here is somebody that was in china last  two years ago when all that was going on in in uh beijing you know that that is an interesting uh
instead  instead have  have them pick up around the school yard have them
does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live
yeah well maybe you can
yeah except theyi have got a now okay there we ran into some problems once i remember uh theyi have got a a nut and bolts system called wentworth
it unfortunately it is a and it is a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible
uh james avery i do not know if you have that up there but it is it is a very good company that sells sterling silver things and
but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash ugly american type
finding parking places and getting in and out the doors
congress and and uh is is  they get  they get reelected by what they do for their districts uh in terms of bringing in and bringing in money and and uh
area are lawyers
uh it is too much pressure  you know if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice but relaxed yeah
and my allergies got so bad because_n i walked and um i need to like you know they have stairmaster at the y but i just ca not seem to get myself on the stairmaster and i do not like exercising at all
i keep trying uh you know you just ca not ca not give up on it uh i uh i bought some uh plants from michigan bulb company  they send them to you all ready alive
well it does sound very interesting maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that
exactly because i mean here in uh the county where i went to high school
yeah good luck to you okay we will see you um bye
and course in plano that is a big deal we would even where we lived in albuquerque before there is a lot of parent involvement in children is lives
my word
and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury  some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time
yeah how about_n that huh
uh the car seat fits in very easily and we can seat belt it in securely it is that is that is a big difference in conversations there  yeah
well it is kind of it is kind of like reading magazines any more if half of the time was not spent watching commercials it probably would not be so bad but uh it it is you are missing an awful lot i would rather personally rather watch
okay well and it says uh which foods would you recommend for uh a menu for a dinner party
but uh somebody i talked to last week was said they had the uh they had problems doing some of the work down there because they they really had some heat hanging on
are more uh uh kind vocalized noise some ostentatious homes
um you know the bane of our existence these days uh but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for reports  reports and papers and that sort of thing
um you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents um it is just like the way it it has been for years i mean you know
yes i do uh so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward i work for a school system so i am  able to do that um because_n i get at  home a little earlier
you know just a technician
the um
or you know it it it is always trade offs and you actually have to as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to to to replace this thing it is i mean not just exercise but anything it is
well yeah yeah
of course we kind of concentrate on there was not much to take out of the country i felt like we are going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just
i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay
they just overflow
yeah but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize um
i understand it very well and in fact i was a private pilot there
i guess that is why it is so hard to swallow you know right off the bat they started doing well
i do not uh i suspect uh let is see noise i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but lord knows you should not  one should not say that
and then i think that is going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do
yeah noise i am  in are you still there
it is and  and it is happening in in a lot of public schools uh because of of budget cuts but on the other hand what it does provide is is for the um
so i i am  actually in baltimore yeah you could say i am  in baltimore
they have to watch out who comes in and and they are always finding drugs on you know on the most um innocent looking kind of
that is not yeah that that those numbers were were great but it
well you know but
mine do not either they have um my mom has a uh has a mastercard and a visa card and that is it
okay because i got i got um one of those little uh microwaves the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water
not at all
 yeah see around around here it is like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors
 well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on 
although i think it could turn out really nice i have not ever done fancy painting but i sure did my share of just regular painting uh ii have painted several houses inside no i
he had a couple of them bombarded
yes yeah i think uh
yeah we went first time we went to london paris and touched a little bit of scotland and second time we went to munich germany and were there a week and loved germany
it is uh both coasts are really pretty
our time is scarce
in some of the areas in colorado you know where they ski in the winter time you can make some pretty good arrangements for uh for group uh activities and things like that
and uh
which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we are uh very very uh {cognizitive} and aware of all these type of uh
in the state  in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there is no way that that can be done
i guess my biggest problem is that uh they seem to uh be
society has changed everything has changed yeah yeah
i do not know when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that
second trip down whether it is for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day
um i am  basically not interested and i also find the um everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and misguided  and off the um
i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than
so i enjoy going to the beaches myself as far as a favorite beach
the credit bureau and say hey you know we are paying you good money to report this properly and you are not doing your job
started off as an electrical  electrical  an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more so they do force them people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which i think is wonderful
as as my main objectives normally
and course car and driver ii have got two  two teenage boys that are in the market for a car so we ii have been trying to teach them how to read for what is a good deal and what is to to get as far as insurance costs et cetera
oh that must be nice
than we used in three years the last three years of vietnam
oh that is good to have uh knowledgeable people
oh okay i am  in garland so  well  i am  in dallas right now but i am  living in garland um
uh in fact i got my wife a a used car that was uh also a chevy celebrity because
i do not know if dallas is in the top three but oh do you own a gun
organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
yeah that that is real scary actually i mean i  i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but
um hum which  which seems so awful
yeah i think so too i  i agree with it uh i know kay is company you know they started it couple of years ago
yeah it  it  it is the artist not the merit
that that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with insects particularly caterpillars um wei have had very very poor luck with uh all of the core crops and like um uh
commercial solicitations  solicitations primarily
and and probably  you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a
okay yeah me too good good talking to you thanks okay bye bye
and that opens up a whole  another can of worms i guess ford is suppose to start out with they are gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in california
and at that time i was going to college and i liked to go camping and {bajaing} and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it
yeah and again i do not i mean again i do not know that i am  you know how qualified i mean i think it would be interesting
and i notice today is uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes
really
right now like my
for any reason
did well ii have been with the company sixteen years now i was a wf for several years
do you um do you care for the fruitcake
and so like
is that a tough system to be in
huh well see ii have never heard of that well i know that sounds stupid but i really have not ii have never heard of that
so now we just put ours out for the city of plano do you live in plano okay yeah
well we enjoy it yeah  but since ii have been married and with a family uh
that is what is wrong they are not stringent enough
so uh we are we are originally from virginia this part of the country but we did spend twenty years in norman and enid and loved it
yeah i mean it is because_n your never home you know you are working you are at school
oh goodness my mind is gone blank it uh othello
say you did uh starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one
we would go to a movie on thursdays and um
yeah well a lot of my camping was up in the arbuckles as i was growing up there is a place that used to be called platte national park up around sulphur and davis and and not too far from turner falls
yes i am on staff to hal ammon to gte
yes like the lehrer news hour or something yeah i think that is that is helpful i think that is right
so i do not have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh noise
yeah ii have heard that that is a really good way to get cars up here they  they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they do not um
i mean that is yeah
oh so do i
what else did it kill  did it kill anything else it was not supposed to
for tv that is out right now i i the shows i like to see for one reason or another that ii have been
do you oh not me
seems like it was extra cold last night though
but uh but that is i wear normally just wear like
right what about if if um they demanded to have spanish as the official language
no ii have ii have got the lx
no i have not i do not know if ii have even heard of that one it must have uh what is his name in it
yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and
no it is not do you have children
that is the hardest thing i think you know to to deal with is that people love your kids i put um
oh so mine are you know i use mine for recreation i do not and i enjoyed my guns i have a good time with them so
now my personal opinion uh i do not know uh uh here lately it seems
well yeah i guess although there are some women who honestly if they were uh i i would go running if they were chasing  chasing chasing me
she is six
and and you say you had him how long
yes it and it is funny because_n the one i have every single month without fail she has babies
yeah but the thing the thing that bothers me about it the most is
i mean there is it is it is a blackening seasoning
boy after you know after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between
so the the policeman stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on you know the dog mess
okay um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and um
right it troubles me too that  that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and noise by  definition for some of us at least the public good includes
putting him in another home they said he will not go back
well a little bit we mostly do our newspapers we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled
there is only well my mother is ninety three and she wo not go this year because it is just too hard on her
like for example let is see uh bad company what like
oh i could imagine
you have uh huh
like the shelves and
any connection with what they they vote and what happens so they very frustrated and they do not do anything so there is learned helplessness type of you know no matter what i do it is not gonna help so why bother
and an and while while there are some advantages to that  there is less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things uh
uh how big is your family
then i do not argue with it because it is not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need noise to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania
yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife vocalized noise uh she went to uh the school out there in lubbock um she was there for two or three years before we got married
being he was exposed to that and maybe he was not before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works
more practical
you pay too much
now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small
oh that is pretty good yeah
one of them_n just got his law degree
the entire trial was left to one person  ii have got a four year old that you can hear but um
right and um it is really been great i have had no problems with it you know except little little minor things like you know belts and course you know
which was our basic goal
think pennsylvania  pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because i am  from uh from pennsylvania also
if people have to pay less money in taxes they will have more money to spend uh and if they have more money to spend then that will be a a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity
uh differences uh the machine tends to react as fast as i can i use an eighty  as a matter of fact use an eighty eighty eight at at home uh which is really old iron
you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um
yeah three uh huh well i try to go over there at least three times a week and i try to walk um at least five times a week
yeah they did tell us that we would have to you know every couple of years just you know do brush up on the color
and they are talking about uh cutting uh aid to the schools particularly the uh university systems
some of the
but i lean towards if it is premeditated or if it is uh
about two years ago it got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep and uh then we got this new cat so i
that is right
and uh it is
because of that smoke fumes when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it because back then i was walking back and forth to kentucky  from well not back and forth i was walking home from uh
i live in garland texas
but uh back to the issue is uh
well it is it is kind of near abilene but it is it is uh about halfway in between here and and abilene
youi have never heard of that
periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference book and uh the last uh noise i am  embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i cannot
i try to when it is nice out it is been raining a lot this spring but i try to i have a bicycle and i like to cycle a lot
uh and and find out every
and then i will get busy and if no one reminds me then i will forget so i am  not too sure course i guess that is part of being apathy too but i do try to vote in every one but uh
and he said that is the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired and  but i hear that bill is in the senate right now and it is
i do not know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we are talking about are going to contribute to change and i do not know uh
yes it is hard on the folks  your folks too i know they are all yours and your wife is folks still live in colorado uh huh
and i ii have been down to the south of england where supposedly king arthur is castle was
yeah but see these people i know they keep them_n up underneath their pillows and  you know sitting right on top of their dresser drawers i mean it is no wonder you know the kids get in there and then they blow uh other people away so you know
yeah  yeah right
ten years out of your life of really being around them_n when they really need you and their younger ages it is worth that ten years and it pays off i think
and yet they have they have a right to be here and i know that but it is it sometimes it is gets touchy
and so really is a treat because uh you know we do not make a trip sixty five eighty you know sixty five to eighty miles depending how far in dallas it is
you have to because there is always more things to do there is always things that you can make priority to it but i just i do not demand a lot for myself and so
granddaddy of most uh data base management systems there it is got some pretty uh strong competitors some of them have reviews that are better than d base so i uh i uh i think uh by now it is a matter of uh personal taste
you do not think so uh that is the one with candice bergen in it um
another reunion we do is uh at christmas time this is something that a tradition that my grandparents started
well aids is a nasty terrible disease and you die from it so i think that uh they need to look into it and it is kind of like cancer i do not you know how
and they were really uh helpful
oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh
and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure
that is what my i do not know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price
i really do not feel that but i do feel tougher laws but some way i feel they have to uh revise our criminal system
for some of the different fields
uh apa printers and so i get frustrated uh watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer more so than i do over over access speed um
that was quite a the buffalo scene in that thing was so real it is like  i mean it just blew me away
well when our kids were small we had a couple of uh good good women who uh would often come  uh get them_n to come to the house and and take care of 
um hum noise well i know uh uh in michigan uh the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air
right that i did not ever understand i mean wei have got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so 
my family used to live in littleton massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet
into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems
entering bad information of one sort or another and
 well we lived in a a small town in oklahoma for a while and that was the major entertainment in fact that was about the only  only entertainment
can send in a request for payment and they will uh and they will send me you know a check for the amount they withheld
uh well ii have always been a ford man myself
uh yeah they are every year and and still you wind up meeting people you  you  you never knew you were related to let alone
look professional 
do they have a pool or what is
well let is see what else for catering i am  trying 
they need to provide a lot of guidance during high school
my husband just  turned  on  something  noisy anyway uh she comes to the school and there are a group of teachers and we exercise regularly and for an hour and we do it twice a week
yeah that you are not uh a menace or
survey system and and um
even  even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes
oh the only texas politician that i actually know is is a woman is ann richards
so yeah it is nice
uh it it varies it is  it is totally dependent upon what mood i am  in it can be anything from classical to um uh rock and roll
i do not have a lot of time and i do not really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i do not think they have any redeeming value
you going to take advantage of the the ground thermal action and and and and uh use for your heat and cooling
true true well we have dogs that are pretty very protective  so if they are if they are stupid  yeah if they are stupid enough to come through then 
so you are  what you are saying is if if this is the second offense then you execute them_n
uh as far as i am  concerned i  i guess i should do it but being lazy i do not if if somebody made it easy for me to separate my trash and pick it up i would more than gladly participate  uh
i see i see  do many people listen to country music
living  having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children and
noise i try not to um
yeah i am  surprised to hear that the v ns are coming back uh theyi have got some pretty powerful ns
and so why should we pardon something that we do not believe our our lord  uh god is pardoning do you know what i mean
uh it  it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here when they are not just come in
when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i would not get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i would not get it period
i do have friends that have children yes
i think i think that there would that there would be a large variation in
bedrooms smaller and smaller it seems like they get  incredibly  small um but uh
i i believe i would probably tend towards that
that is probably true that is probably true
right best training in the world is not going to feed  put food on your table
and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they do not understand uh how other people live um they do not understand
so we did the harpsichord with old time traditional christmas carols not not you know the bouncy  you  know sing along kind but
right i used  i used to take mccalls and good housekeeping and um several magazines like that a few years ago at at at home
oh sure and they got all those late charges now and stuff they did not used to have and if you go over the limit there is a charge i mean they are they are really starting to hit us 
noise or in a larger situation where actually it is more of an institution and youi have actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it is not
yeah i i do enjoy camping
lucky you 
as well as the other children in the center you know
there was it like most areas that are built um there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from 
yeah well the cowboys are on a roll theyi have won like i think six or seven in a row now so they are supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the play offs
those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self esteem to do and achieve whatever you set your mind on
oh yeah caulking windows was a great mystery to them you know you know they just watched the water pour in on the carpet but it is a sharif myneer homes if that means anything it did not really mean anything to me except i liked it
things like that but it it is just finding the time for  these  things  that  you you enjoy but
talk me into something  um i think they are intimidating to both men and women
right which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention
and you know it is the type of thing that she was living down in florida my vocalized noise families was up in maryland
and um we usually get a fog uh right about oh i guess about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast
yeah i mean even  even if it is just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there is a door seal that vocalized noise does not quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while and  and it is clearly just a a design problem there
i had a uh last year i had another  i had another german shepherd now this one was purebred and uh
but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate
i know that in poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that is it that is what they look at it as there is no
 yeah um it was fun  i am  uh i am  a baseball fan i you know my my girlfriend is like you know she she puts up with me being a baseball fan you know but uh we go we walk into this place ralphie is diner and i look on the wall and there is like uh
uh well i have not tried that i do not know it is been i bet  it is it is been  thirty years since i played tennis
and radio if you are not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper
the case
well
oh i had uh i just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there that you know that they were good i  i did not know that uh
i think you can only get it through subaru dealer etcetera so
 bramalea it is a security company and and building they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings noise and
yeah i do not know i  i think that uh i know that judges are not supposed to be crooked however
peter grace of wj grace and company was uh appointed by i believe reagan to um
uh anything in the hobby field as far as um needlework is concerned
um hum well you know uh i know american express  i am  now  i am  working at american express now and they
uh if there is anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a m e besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess that is diversion uh
what area do you live in
 so i i enjoy it
uh my husband tries very hard to do that for us and we used the managing your money software package with andrew tobias he is familiar with that one
you know my my parents are not quite at that age yet so i have not
oh you are stuck
quite a bit of time on one story they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like the uh what is that abc is nightline
because many times in the past theyi have you know they are happy to take our money and stuff but they often times fail to give us any support in return
oh well knox is just over the hill here  yes uh huh they they no longer are you know
my parents in new york had uh
it is kind of hard 
well you know and they say that
yes  yes now we have friends with a van and when they go on vacation a lot of times they will just sleep in the van you know
yeah yeah i have four grandchildren
that is causing the hole in the ozone
  that is pretty tough 
i i have a a little bit i ca not say that i am  i i would be an expert on the on the region but uh certainly uh i
uh well qualify that she worked at home i am  sure 
well it is it is pretty the weather is wonderful uh
yeah i am  gonna have go out in and you know in noise you know east fork someplace and and do my thing you know
uh huh oh that is great long as it is not raining
no no
oh i see
that there is obviously racism in terms of even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of crimes than they are represented in the overall population they are also convicted  convicted of capital crimes
oh no they are just they are they are just uh they are wonderful uh
and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years
did they like on bottles did they give you a
substitute my my yeah my kid will do uh four or five hours this week for me no problem
no
um yeah uh actually i teach my kids at home
it is uh it is so important to families then and uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
some of them_n uh my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency and uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy
yeah but you have to have a need i really have no need for it at all um i work for digital equipment and we have a powerful computer down at work
but one of one the things that i do when ii have got some spare time is and i do some woodworking and that oh i guess ranges anywhere from uh
yeah i do not know either it is kind of a tough question
well uh we are trying to keep away from that my husband works for the railroad we have got it real tight but ii have got a four month old baby and i do not want to work i want to tend to her i want to raise my kids
uh huh yeah ii have seen that
you know in the top ten uh of their class and their s a t scores are very low and a lot of it has  has to do with their uh noise
which approach do you find to be um more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting
um i mean i really i really think that that
i do not know um i have not it is been um well seventy nine since i was at school at high school and um
what type of lawn and garden work do you do
you know i pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty a month for two kids  they would eat you alive
on on not only pcs but uh personal  uh professional work stations as well
so when he died we got a little one
i do not know i do not really
well she is into a little bit of everything she is uh
because_n theyi have got the hitting but they need the pitching
my best friend said she likes him i said i if linda likes him i said he is gonna  not he  he could not be all wrong you know i mean he is there is got to be something good about the guy
uh huh one thing about the houses in uh in dallas they do not uh utilize basements the way they did in new york
but and then quit for awhile and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple years ago and uh ii have been playing you know off and on when i can up in minneapolis it is not too easy to play in the winter of course but
ca not survive or or that that are not conforming enough to society so that that we work well together or are they is it a penal
well i enjoyed talking to you
so am i
yeah and uh they traded away for some pitcher too
smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit
yeah she can but i  i think it is also cafeteria style because_n i  i really i  i  i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself
right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
oh yeah oh yeah so that is another  uh we just  a little dog now but he is just as vicious as if you know if you if somebody and loud
in my class and uh when i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad
not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off
is the result of that if  if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side i think that uh it will be on the way out eventually
yeah i like bowling too i have not been for a while just do not have the time
tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink  they are innocent right 
i just do not know where it would come from
which is on the west coast like right across from england
but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents
oh noise uh designing women yes with the sugarbakers i think that is one reason i named my daughter julia  well that well and my great grandmother is name is julia so we named her that too um
 do you  well maybe i better let you go and go solve the conflict there 
well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
so we have many recycling activities and i am  in in full uh support of all of them_n
yeah  i really enjoy watching andy griffith
and she had done that and she felt like that helped her
really well you know um what do you do as far as i  i take it do you um run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing
income tax for those who do not have it that is i mean we do not have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through
uh goodness
what they call ambulance chasing and go after it you know it is quite easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer
so and um noise this is my first year off and ii have always worked uh the time that they were little and so i decided to
you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in l a on the freeways and then you come here in in the dallas area um
relationship with the adults to say you know here is what is right and here is what is wrong and here is what we expect of you
and then you you bake that and then you um take things like kiwi and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want
one group of them decides that they are going to negotiate or they are going to do something
the what
this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i would really never met people that did
that is true yeah  yeah you do not you do not want to have worry about it 
vocalized noise um
we moved oh last august and we are getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to ii have forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down
yeah i know what you mean i uh when i was in dallas i was supervisor and i had uh four non exempts
cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and it is so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory i was surprised how easy it was
i think families were more together they they did more things together uh they ate dinner at the table together um
uh pittsburgh
oh i 
now did you see uh driving miss daisy
all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it is kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
however i tend to agree with you that well i do not tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that
and you have to pay that whether you are on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick
uh whatever capital uh that  uh that 
they do not add anything what about you
need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do because_n i started shooting my dad
um noise so we did not ever made that mistake again luckily noise but uh we are
the woods that he would come in his little log boat down the river and we would have to we would vocalized noise and he would make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he would found and
well that is not really immigration
well i i uh just in my lifetime i know that the role of women has changed drastically also my mother when she began having her family she quit her job and stayed home until
the steamed crabs well true male marylander  marylander  marylander is have have old bay on just about everything they put it on their french fries they will put it in their potato salad they will um
we went uh
wei have never been we went as far as as uh like las vegas  and yellow stone park we did go we should have gone the whole way over but we did not
and the the waitress never once came behind me um um on our side of the table she reached across the table she never once asked if we wanted coffee we had to grab onto someone else they did not
but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home uh after having a
yeah that sounds great ii have ii have noticed uh another thing um when i was younger my father was always working and
well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit
yeah they are pretty neat little ii have never seen one
we took him and uh we start them_n out real young even and in the winter we just take electric blankets and put them_n on
well you know i mean i i actually lived in beirut from sixty eight to seventy  to eighty four and so i mean it is it is been dangerous for sometime i am  not sure that it and it is you know changed that much
yeah i i wonder if that  i wonder if that will uh uh make things different ii have heard that uh
i do not know if i am  making any sense or not
noise well wendy what kind of music do you like
um hum well wei have heard bad wei have heard some bad things about some of those you know they
uh huh uh huh
i think it is uh for a while there music seemed to really have  popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it i was really tired of uh
just kind of enjoyable to you know
probably they do not have birth control
and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they are there to sell newspapers that is the problem with the news both the on television and the paper
paying that as well yeah well if you could call it a benefit that cmu
see uh uh yeah actually  noise actually when i went i thought the food was not good
anybody tries  anybody tries to hurt them i wo not even blink
uh it is to their advantage to play to as big an  audience  as  possible so uh i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases
the city schools are some of the models for the rest of the country
but noise i am  not i am  not naive to think that my children are not gonna not do it i it was not that long ago that i was that young
they do not even have a bonding with that child they do not ever  ever see the
to stewing  stewing  stewing up trouble you know with the callers and things like that but they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know and some of it sometimes it is serious and they have some good feedback and all that stuff and noise
it is a picture disk with uh of him and bing crosby doing peace on earth uh little drummer boy and you know you can get this as a forty five but this is like a twelve inch with um the um the label is
noise there are times when is it uh
i guess
and uh collecting i particularly like uh antique pitchers and my husband is interested in those too and uh so we do that and uh
uh and that means every congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobody is working on less money going to his area or on anybody else is area
okay all set
and we could not we just dismissed the case you know and and she was uh taken care of by the proper
yes i do she was um
and it had
and the the home uh the family type unit you know and i think when kids have that they do not noise get into as much trouble or seek to
uh with uh with a parent in the home whether it is the father or the mother
and and that worked okay for me
yeah  yeah well i  i  i do not  i do not know we we also my wife and i uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that is just a mile from our house we um
you know anybody caught talking in the english metric  you know in the will be shot or something like that you know but uh  uh
i know we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever 
yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it was not people that were really fair and
in some in some instances they are they are over used
that came out and said that you know it would not be receiving this much publicity if it was not for someone like magic johnson and it would be you know very interesting to see
and we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out we you know we we searched for dock and we ate the wild plants and we gathered wild berries and uh noise it is really
that have the talent to do the best years and um that they had not had these
huh that is good
um that is here in the ninth grade i believe it is something like that it is worded and um
yeah oh they are good they are great and it is uh like uh uh usually about a family of um
it you know it is it is a major purchase now what we used to pay for homes
um hum i you know like i said i like isaiah thomas but i think sometimes that uh
is it really i would not imagine that
sort of slowed down and nobody was used to him he had servants at home and very very rich and
how does it how does compare have you can you compare  like how does it compare to the post
that male syndrome of flicking that channel  thing  you  know and he is flipping around there and
where  where do you work
no we were never blessed with children um we had a foster child for a while and we are real active
cups of bisquick and uh
he is in elementary school and he is not severely learning disabled i mean you know he just
noise  hello okay so you were with ti huh
so do you know of any other shows in the evening or something that you enjoy
uh i do not know what what it is percentage wise but i
why is that
so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother i will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still we will share that job
um no the ones in indiana uh huh
you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session you know all these uh intangible  intangible  intangible things and you are thinking
conversation we can only do our own reactions
yeah we are doing some here in in cash valley the community here there is uh
and i lived there for seven years
uh in my children is case it was one where uh pretty much up until
you from texas by the way yeah yeah most of the people i talk to on this are from down there i am  one of the few new  east coast people
and that has saved us  thousands of dollars vocalized noise you know from plumbing to mechanic to anything like that but
and i would like to know that there are
so there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they do not want but then any kind of computer paper letters uh booklets they will even take things that are bound
yeah it is i  i uh i have a modem in my computer so i can log into the system  the uh network at georgia tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful but um
i put a stop to some of them_n as far as the door to door either religious groups or people
i am  from pennsylvania
i know there is a number i think that or uh the post office you can send in a number and i do not have it myself in fact i thought of getting it my sister has it and said we she would give it to me and she lives in ohio
uh word processing something um
uh huh yuck looking i mean ugh um
but the taxes would be you know
we will rent two or three movies on thursday and uh with luck you will have one or two that are good
right i guess my i you know i come out am sitting on the fence but i have some concerns about uh you know if you require someone to do this for a year or two
yeah you figured it was like omaha right  no it is uh it is not newark but uh yeah it is got problems
yeah a big thing
everything is is spanish english in florida and i did not particularly enjoy it quite frankly
able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that is no good
as  as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day
 i expect so uh
they all pass through and then they all end up spending the night christmas eve night so that we open our presents on christmas day and they go out to the other you know the in laws in between some of this but they are all
i guess i like it because of of the quickness of it um and and i like it because it takes the players
i never really messed with anything uh gardening or anything like that until now but uh i  i keep hearing all the stories of of different parts of town
oh that would be enjoyable
 i avoid them with all 
that which was assumingly/assumably their property it was on his property
i do not watch much of that i watch our town plano uh plano east is where my children will go i have an eleven year old son and he plays basketball and my son  my husband coaches his team
uh no you go down i uh uh you uh you go down uh
that is a very long day for kindergarten but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this
oh i see yeah
yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does
and uh as hard as they try to get these
that is right we use a lot vocalized noise we sure do
my main concern and what i enjoy doing was was the interior and uh it was it was pretty shelled uh but it was fun it taking the whole thing you know the whole interior apart and ordering new carpeting and
 i bet
uh do you work
they go oh that place is great there is no bugs  but oh okay because uh we were having a big  a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad
well i have a brother that lives there 
yeah we do so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures so
income  {incomewise} anyway and uh i get tired of supporting the whole country
well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion
country is not bad i can  i grew up in nebraska so it was like um yeah i  i listen to it once in a while but it is it is probably not my my top mode i guess that is pretty pretty popular down in plano though uh
well i do not know i uh as much as i did not like school when i was going through it
a seventy eight chevy wagon and then a a four year old uh crown victoria that i love and
we could spend our way rich
to read books and and noise because even if it is like you say it is light reading you are still getting some
oh well that is nice
but not at the college level
if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment so if somebody killed somebody in your family noise then you had the right
angora he is he is black
uh no we we moved to iowa and um i am  working at a day care right now
you know i mean so looking at it so  all so i have some bias in this
discipline and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now
and uh have some
um my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low standard  uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
it is  it is  it is sort of a joke but it is really true the old timers even the people who are technologists do not know how to operate these electronic things like vcr is and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy
does he yeah i need to ii have got some applications i need to hand them out but uh this is a great project that they are working on and it is really going to lead the way uh for a lot of economics  um applications and and
yeah so i think hopefully if you know i guess a lot of the large organizations probably ti did they advertise on television how successful they are
i think there are certain
um i have been
that uh he he said  said  said it out here in washington  uh washington but he started the um uh noise the movement for creative nonviolence
i am  not that liberated i mean my mom is kind of old fashioned you know so i you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff but um i think it is
and used to travel up there to knox quite a bit and and i even did once when i was a child you know so
but i think a lot of it is you know when the people get older they will do something like that
but he maintains his weight now because he jogs like uh nine miles a day
you know have like a little separate wing or something where i would not have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person
uh at the same time you have to restrain him because they might hurt themselves they might stand up and not be able to stay stood up or might fall down or whatever
well what they tell me but i mean you know
to the {n th} degree or anything because uh
oh i see huh
so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome and they are always over in someone else is house so our wei have been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and
yes but my concern is first of all that not all all persons who i think should be receiving capital
uh well from my neck of the woods it is hilly um you know
because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and
and uh course uh all the people that follow the lakers and everything out there in in california um and it also helps when they were winning 
it is it it is not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean i am  fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city
well it is fun i like talking to new people and i
noise and uh i do not know what is the prognosis for uh this year
yeah this
uh because that is a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that does not do it that does not require uh uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact
okay what do you feel are everyday occurrences that are invasion of privacy in your opinion
yeah right they just do not howl that much anymore
oh okay
ii have seen uh
there is a lot of places uh oh down even in southern utah the canyons canyon lands and bryce canyon and
overall tend to support them_n but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh kuwait was uh
yeah 
what part what sections are they in
that is true i did not think about that like for instance uh if someone is working on heavy machinery or uh say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that
no did not have shrimp there huh  i remember food 
naturally that is i got in all kinds of trouble doing that 
well they are uh out i am  out in uh california recycling has been in for a while i mean it is yes it is very important now i think it is actually always been important we are just recognizing it now that things are starting to run out um
uh waste material in general and um and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements
no i am  not that old either  i am  only twenty nine  so  social  changes are not that much for me either
and you only get one of them
oh i probably average at least
that is right and they are so independent i love having them_n for that reason
when i when i wanted to go to an undergraduate is institution i was looking for something that was you know rather small and easy to get around you know
um or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain  certain dimensions tie them_n up and put them by the curb well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it is about a foot and a half deep and it is about one by one and a half foot wide and long
yeah uh i do not really know of anyone that is like looking  that is looking for colleges now you know because with the exception of uh people is younger brothers and sisters noise then the only advise passed down is do not go to georgia tech  uh
yeah that i do not understand i mean uh whose rule is that you know
very inconvenient and um it is just you know has not been very practical to get into a lot of those things if they would make it something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least
yeah yeah if you like platoon  yeah if you liked platoon you will probably really like this because it takes pretty much the same direction for the time you know uh i think
yeah we loved the we loved the the new jersey area too because the noise the lakes were really pretty close you know you could
did it really
like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week
 well i drive a pick up truck
and uh plano has plans i believe it is tentatively scheduled for sometime in may of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people is home and they can 
i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys do not know what is going on but i thought they were they  they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me
noise yeah i am  not too familiar with thelma and louise uh noise uh uh uh recently i ii have seen uh the fisher king have you seen that
and she was from boston and she was i should not talk about that but she was  pretend she was a television show and she  she was very snooty and uh her kids were going to places like amherst and bu and i said i did not know what that was i she went oh and i thought um
and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the board of equalization
is not that terrible
because your parents are engineers or chemists they are they are you are most likely to do better in school they are going to help you
noise motta was probably the best theyi have ever had or ever will have but he i do not know he just he was such a hot head
well it is yeah it is it is primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know ii have got some uh bushes around the foundation  you know the foundation planting things like that and then there is some uh
yeah i thought well now i guess probably six weeks before i had to do my arms the whole time the whole twenty minutes
believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought either to make it a full fledged state or or let it go one or the other
but i do not i do not like to have to carry them_n you know uh but you have to
yeah  do you know that ii have never i think other then except like on a commercial or on news coverage or something like entertainment tonight ii have never seen mtv
make it more oh easier to find out you know what is going on do you know what i mean
well there must be a a vocalized noise a a a very great degree of that but
is that i think that uh the federal government
and uh there there is a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very  sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them_n is in soccer and the other one just loves to do it
put her outside and hey she is fine
uh i know that from  because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his eagle
what is that
and apparently they they do not break down very easily and
um hum yeah
yes yes it is down in uh more southern and  and  western areas and of course we are um about two hours from the northern border straight south and
uh for the bad times of the company what about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well
yeah no
uh no optical the dental is fully covered um
is that right i did not realize that
uh to a degree i have not kept up as uh much as i would like ii have just been so busy uh i barely get a chance uh
yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid march i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that
and i got a little nest in there that looks like it is got two little birds in there and ii have got some dolls sitting in there
oh that is interesting yeah that is probably true i mean well we also we would be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people are not working it is back in the system
well i guess wei have covered the topic pretty thoroughly
were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all
not that i can think of
of uh making ends meat even in a family that which has a two two parent family
well we are we are moving to a new house and so we will we will have to get started over there noise
i mean gee whiz i all i remember was we had tornadoes about the same time and that was the big highlight they were afraid they were going to go down through the center of the the the golf course  and  that is  what  i  remember  the  most about that uh but i do remember thinking it was a lot different to be out there
well it is a community center it is a community hall it is a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen in it
noise possibly buy something like that um
and uh this golden retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh
but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important uh
well that is true
well do you agree with that requirement that they meet those uh academic
no i uh as a matter of fact wei have never had a leak actually yet now this we just bought the house last year and um uh just before it we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so
oh goodness
uh the loss of life
and uh ii have seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals
i do not know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
but i think we just may need to have uh you know get sharp people from all over the country
yeah but what what what are the steps
okay in order to make the uh curried chicken i just fried the chicken
uh i think just looking at how uh her uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before
that probably has two a a good and a bad side for young people wanting to become doctors i mean what you get is other people who are motivated to be because_n the money is not i guess as much for doctors anymore so they would wind up getting
yeah that would be
well i painted  an awful lot until his death which was several years
now what do you mostly do
noise the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time there is some fairly good training programs
you know there is a tv and a vcr and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they are upstairs playing music it it could still happen then
oh me neither
what we could talk
uh she spends a lot she likes to spend on anything and everything  with body lotion  everything so we really have not uh
and you know some places have like the house next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining room and a den but to stick a wall between two rooms
i had not uh thought of it from that point of view before i have been in a fairly important trial
it is so funny because tom is getting more and more adept at doing things it is just things like painting just always used to really scare me he did not know where to start um you know with a paint can you know an
uh  and and uh
you know i just read about here is another thing that you can buy  it just read about it in the paper today you can get this attachment for your answering machine
in positions of power really
not one dime is deducted from his check
well noise we moved in when we moved in there there was not any outside lights and so wei have been trying to install some
which is why people are talking  about we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that is more fair
and since then uh ii have i live alone
let is say another audience let is say a north american and then when they hear it it it it is a really it is another form of music and you know it is sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music
a kind of traveled  around traveled
and unfortunately the jury  the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too
yeah yeah
that is right that is right
i would love to do that but they have snakes over there
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable
yeah i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the mc hammer who is really you know seems to be the hot one of of today he used um
oh i see how would how did they how do they pick their people
and that is kind of weird we have not figured that out yet
that is what they are coming out with here matter of fact
six seven and eight
and uh if you do your job fine and if
and uh they come in and their attitude is i am  a bad boy and proceed to  prove it
no not at all 
um and then the bike on the other day
my wife works at night so she does uh tupperware so she is gone a lot at nights and so i spend a lot of time with them_n
i my oldsmobile right now that i have uh is getting near eighty thousand and still in
the rocky mountains are so much uh bigger than anything that they theyi have got down here that
yeah i guess you do
oh yeah yeah well yeah i see what you are saying
uh would come about just as small pox vaccinations were for years and some of the other types of vaccinations for syphilis and uh gonorrhea what have you
right so and we uh
no really  not really
and dow chemical had a real good thing going you know dow chemical had a photographer at every demonstration
wei have always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door she is definitely ready to get out and run  run around
and i was disappointed when i went to texas i did not see that many of them yes 
yeah you have to hunt hard for them_n i guess
uh being basically an engineer and liking uh doing installation work well there is not any i mean there literally is no installation work going on
well there well they say after  after three offenses why it is automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses
but um uh i will i will say this uh the the celica that i own now i have replaced the clutch in it
some place where you
or biology department one or the other anyway uh and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in dallas somewhere who had picked up one in
and uh bought her all brand new stuff and they they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there
okay
 poor buddy you  know i said he is only been gone a day and you already want to replace him  buddy um hum 
gee  i needed that you know and then you get the remote control the stereo phonic whatever and all of those things
and um the mets
is it what color is is yours blooming
and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east because we are both originally from this part of the country
and that last week is pretty lean generally  speaking so
well i love it we uh got a new baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um
um that is probably true well considering what ii have seen in the last uh you know two seasons i am  beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you do not have to spend the big money as far as i am  concerned to uh
it it could go on for years and years until they they start  start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it is it is it is doing it is doing some damage and and something is got to be done
and uh in order to get eagle you have to have merit badges in um citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world
yeah well  well  well that is true but that there is you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong
and uh only uh ryan did not want too much publicity on it because_n he did not want the son getting  too nervous about this whole thing game is a game you know well the rangers
it was so good that i had forgotten that it was christmas eve i mean that is something for a kid
but the last problem i had with my vehicle was a noise uh fuel pump that needed replacing
um kalachandji is it is uh it is a hari krishna run restaurant
and that you know you ca not just send someone off to washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective
she is become very important in my life
your kids have you noticed how kids wo not eat tomatoes out of anything
so there is one or two nights a week we have a on monday nights we set aside time where it is called uh family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together
yeah on the tracks yeah
really yeah well at ti i was getting for the both of us it was like seventy five dollars a month
so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
judith krantz i know her
she was uh
in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping  with  their  boyfriends
and what i am  i am  curious i  i know why i love a stick shift why do you  why did you want one noise
that is true we saw um
i will bet you it is a dutch iris
well carolyn the uh
i believe there was one case i do not i do not know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean
and  and uh then he tried to make grapefruit citron one time
yeah when we were living in california people all the time went in the winter you know up in the mountains and stuff i do not know i ca not see that  either um south of san francisco
so that is important 
okay bye now
uh huh or is it on uh one of the lakes
that we pretty reliably like to go to on some sunday mornings
cultural change within the management first and now it is kind of filtering down to the peon level but uh
and there is rats in the attic you know
<b_aside> right i am  fixing to get them right now <e_aside>
oh wow no i just started about
until about the last ten fifteen to twenty thirty minutes of it then it then i was just rolling in the floor it was just hilarious
then they will pay you a certain amount of money and that is one thing that started in the community
uh professional career only lasts seven years so that is when you think about it that is really not a very long time of course
i dropped oh i would say almost twenty pounds
so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes vocalized noise
oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh
so ii have heard some stuff about them but um
well i loved that novel and then somebody said oh god this would have been even long ago because i was in boston and it was raining all night and i had a hole in my roof and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and uh i was reading dune
it is just a you know over priced
so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and ii have
the the skating rink does the rest practically i guess boy what a help that is
 that is true they do
vocalized noise they are they are putting more laws and more restrictions and more burden on the honest citizen the one who does not give them a problem anyway
overboard to uh protect persons from being having their civil rights violated to the point where the person that is damaged is not
well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh we are on the east coast now
yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in
wow that is great was it a pell grant
and uh that is another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for
yeah i do not have that much problems so noise with my vehicle knock on wood
yeah i am  talking to you from dallas uh huh
uh william shatner wrote it
no okay
to florida  and pulled it behind us and that was really funny because  i mean it is funny now it was not funny then an all these very strange things happened i mean it was just really noise
good self help well um probably the best one that i i know of and i work with all the time is called search for significance
maybe a level above or perhaps at the grease monkey level and yet they will they will charge you for brain surgery on these cars as though they all know everything
uh
i guess it depends on the person depends on how  motivated you  are
i like those those are pretty
 by then
our grandchildren we have a uh fourth grader and then we have one that is in kindergartner and and i know the fourth grader
i have the experience uh the last school that i went to was mississippi state university which is
and then we will see what happens when uh they are not funded quite as much or supplied with arms the same way
uh i it it is uh that is an awful lot to uh to expect of a person to uh to kill somebody is what it amounts to
you bet you bet
yeah there is a there is a a song that i know which says you know that it is like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent
but it is a drier
and  where are you where are you calling from
yeah ii have been sitting here alternately reading and watching  television
and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for people to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch we are a think tank
 all right have a good one
oh well right now we are not we are living in a travel trailer but uh wei have we wei have just moved here to dallas uh recently and we are living in that until we can find a place but
i would rather a snake
i will like to know like where my tax dollars are going too vocalized noise i work hard to get you know i like to know where it is going to
right and it is pretty bad when they are using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of dc is having a real problem uh
kentucky uh north carolina is all the way on the east coast it is further west than georgia it is uh right below virginia
that is a department store
oh really that is interesting
oh galveston
noise any of the recycled products uh we are in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people noise uh noise there are areas where we could uh noise actually we have a couple of the uh
well unfortunately   unfortunately i do not expect a great deal out of them_n they just have too many problems too many ailments  too  many hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point
either one noise well actually um this whole past summer ii have had my old outside of my house repainted
ah shoot the the big problem is there is no real punishment for crime anymore i mean the bigger the crime the less likely you are to get punished for it
uh the problem was that my hair was too long
some crimes and and some lives that that that there is no  other at least emotional reaction to it what about you
because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double
i used to work at um summer camps um a lot when i was in high school and college and i worked at some summer camps in new mexico where um
i have one son
well i have i ii have fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing
it that is a pretty heavy state compared to georgia i mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in georgia but even in georgia
you do not go out when it is
and uh noise my  i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony
yeah yeah yeah that is that is true um you know i had i had a friend who was a uh
you know even between a same sexes in a different in the same role there would there would be differences in the way one guy handled something over the way another guy would handle it so i  i think when you put a male and a female in
and i kept finding noise neighbors and friends and they would move she ended up being in a different home every year
 so so i imagine youi have gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college
people well no they did auction it well people bought a ticket that is how they did it and then the person with the winning ticket got it and things like that and that was kind of a fun one yeah
well what do  do you think in terms of uh benefits
exactly be everything be supermom exactly
that is really scary it has it is done the same thing even in my little town and gosh it is only like a thousand people
that they are they are they are not quite the same as as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools
oh you know and that is really bad because that is really hurting them in the long run because up here at college now um we are so far behind the foreign students vocalized noise
{alrighty} ladies first
that is right you never hear about
well it is just gotten uh completely out of hand as far as the violence in the schools and i do not know what the solution to that is at all i mean its just uh
yeah so i am  i am  an avid aerobics noise uh person and just very very athletic enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports
while we were there we vocalized noise uh had camped on kind of a sandy ground area instead of uh the hard firm uh dirt ground
but uh noise you know i  i  i agree with you the and it is funny because the shows
you know woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that
yeah it it sounds like wei have got real similar situations uh i i go home uh ii have gone home every year now since ii have moved to dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh
that we do not get fixed
and in fact i found that i am  a lot closer with uh i have one son who is gone and i do not even know where he is at um he is taken off for parts unknown but uh yeah and  and uh my
so noise
true that is true um i i am  a very selective watcher i  i look at the tv section and
oh okay
oh okay yeah that is how i got it as well but uh
by trading services with them_n
and uh you just bring the covered dishes every every family brings a a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years
how many cats do you have oh okay
it uh uh fortunately i guess for myself it was not uh it was purely by my own choice
away all their lives
yeah but the thing is is that it is twenty thousand dollars actually my my wife and i are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next
i went to salt lake once
noise sometimes i do sometimes i use miracle whip it depends on what i have noise and sometimes if i am  using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit i will use a little bit of mustard with it
and my number was six i was going yeah and
and he got to talking to the kids and and we recovered the drill and the saw it was but uh it it is one of those you know it was uh not a not a real expensive neighborhood
um they might you know pay for that pay for the classes and stuff but i know they let you they will let you decrease how many hours you work by any kind of percentage you know they will let you work halftime if you want to if you wanna finish you wanna
noise yeah go into the grief that that is there and we are our presidents have always avoided that as a country so it is pretty serious really uh
uh i am  engaged to get married so
yes and um
we do not have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfor/welfare welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing noise um
than before
noise now then what is your idea on what to serve for a dinner party
you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that it is much easier for me than for let is say
yeah no did you push one oh okay okay well then  i think it i just started doing this so i do not know too much about it
i know and to make sure that there is enough people there to keep everybody like that can you know to be involved instead of just leaving them sit in their rooms you know
oh okay
um i was working with an organization that does bible translation
yeah
different point of view yeah i think you have to be very careful in it  with the media in that  for that reason because they they are not because they are very biased
noise i know i just think it is been warm and it is been hot and i like it and it is beautiful and all the trees are pretty and i wish it would stay like this all the time 
well we have a funny commercial around here it says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the world is problems or something
and so you drive to work from there or you just take the summer off
yes ma'am
uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even today i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our girls and and boys too but but the girls especially
unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your daughter
because wei have been so used to it
and they are always you know top top rated movies i mean ii have seen
you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits
but just to
since i am  only a yellow badger i wo not be getting a whole heck of a lot from ti as far as retirement is concerned
well i was real happy with our contractor um actually i was not happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because_n he was pretty um you know
and it is uh called that because it is at the very end of uh a jetty there which is uh sort of the end of this little little point and uh it is a at the very end it is the last set of condominiums there and it is uh
you know iran could not do it in seven years and we went in and did in in seven days what iran could not do in seven years you know so
at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned
such as rape
we we have not we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card
yeah yeah take their rights away from them they say  i never had the desire so i have not ever had that problem
what year model is it
right exactly
but um
that way you can get the feel of you are not cramped on these smaller objects
nice talking to you also
of my father and his vocalized noise brothers and sisters
and it was not very good
oh uh they are covered with like a heavy armor
two liter bottles those clear plastic bottles that is about it
right it is because_n it is another language yeah
he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is
ii have always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up
you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it is so uh  it is so antiseptic that it is almost drives the person crazy if he is not crazy already and so is not that cruel and unusual punishment
until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a cd player that she got for christmas and she is got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto cds i mean i am  sorry other way around off cds onto cassettes um
no i am i work at for the air force so there is a base up here and
sure
noise well i have um two kids i have one seven and one five and um they are in a public school here in tyler and um
noise i ii have been collecting recipes and modifying recipes for a long long time
um a lot of
okay um i guess um
i sort of like the either an old country look or something  um dim lights or something just you know the
noise uh do you have children in school um i have two that are uh now just about_n ready to graduate from college but i also have two that are just entering school um
the gulf and
and last year there were six and this guy is indicted on three of them yeah so you have to  wonder  you  know vocalized noise
but i had not sit  had to sit down and and say well what do i think about it  you know and that is kind of like today i am  not real sure what i think about it i am  kind of you know in in the middle on that one
well but wei have done it before noise and it has not been successful
noise at america is service by carl albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the ti culture here at texas instruments
no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune
was it civil or criminal
average yeah my wife and i were in utah until i guess we were about twenty four
it is just great it is really very nice
i am  not as good about searching something out like that but if i am  there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product
that is kind of what ii have  heard
yes i went uh four years undergrad at university of nebraska at lincoln because lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really
different times
elephant foot soup you know it is easy to do once you find a elephant foot
so they had uh they are having actually a special on today and they were mentioning that and even though kansas city may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that nike
and just prior to that i had a a bathroom totally remodeled and rebuilt and uh so ii have i am  bringing my house up to date really
yeah well that is fun that is kind of fun well we have like every magazine in the world my dad is kind of a chronic magazine subscriber he gets uh
let you start 
i have not uh uh there are not as many good shows that i that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to
uh we have no basement  i do not know if pensacopla  okay  i was not sure most of the ones you know know up north and everything do  but  um anyway
um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh full time job that was more than a full time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every sunday
a recourse if they say well it is it is do you have a positive you know and you say well no that is not really true and they say well okay well here
it is hard to
uh well it is it is uh in terms of north south i would say it is uh a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it
um they have a tail race over in lake lavon and uh you know they wash when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish and uh you catch that white bass and crappie out of there
yeah it is kind of a traction control i think they call it it is it is not just antilock brake i think that is already on most of them_n but there is a further traction control uh
yeah since uh
ah yes the cajuns
they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and
resource that we have is people and they are and they are destroying us they really are
well yes i am as matter of fact not a good one but i am a golfer
we have i do not know i guess it is my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic
it is it is really difficult to put two person  a male and a female in the same role in the same circumstances
i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries  groceries and
but telephone calls
you know friday noon till saturday so that people who i like do things during the week
oh we um rent a duplex right now and it is only like a couple of miles from where i work it is a little bit further for my husband we used to both work at the same building at ti and it was only like two miles from the uh duplex
i sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight i
nights a week maybe or we eat junk food at home
no i think that is very very very wrong
it was really a lot hard harder to do it because_n um it is different depending on what town you are in basically every town is different which i think that that is crazy that it should be coordinated by the state or something but
well i think they need to
it is just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just do not like to drive that far
well wei have been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more noise fun kinds of  things that uh did not really um
you know it is it is getting to the point where we really need to do something with it you know if we are going to get anything out of it so so i am  i am 
uh i do not not right off
uh whether you are mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly president that uh two terms is plenty
the mood for change that there is a lot of change left to happen and that there is still uh communism which is fundamentally opposed to democracy and there is still missiles
right right the ticker tape parade and all that
yeah character profile psychiatric profile
got out of that kind of situation but uh they they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help and
me too
but they may not go into teaching
and it it is like it seems like now they have trests/tests i guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago
no originally i am  from new mexico i was born in new mexico and we lived in uh southbend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh tennessee actually
i guess like like and though nothing i guess nothing is as  as awful as abortion but like gun control
very long ago it was not
see that is that is not even i mean i am  not sure that a person  even a  percentage of of of people in the dallas area ride bikes to work you know i just do not think they do i never see anybody
i would like to assume  assume  assume that they are gonna do do better this whole  this coming year i would sure hope so anyway when we moved down
in the future um the the family unit as it as it once was known is is going to be nonexistent
i am  the always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because_n it is like i can get it done  with i do not have to wait until somebody called me even though i have a feeling what is gonna happen is i will probably get tons of calls you know so
if people around here think if they just get a better security system and a higher fence that you know they are going to take care of themselves and i said there is it is going to come to a point it
yeah and raising cats
in government in business personal life i mean you know
but um otherwise
it seems strange now at the the university where i work it is uh strange too because they have places you can leave cans and some campus organization recycles them
but that was because i wanted to work and i was not ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her  you  know
so we will make something you know uh some sort of pasta or something you know homemade pasta or lasagna or something
oh
you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and and if youi have got uh food containers or anything like that it is a big problem so not only do you
uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes
then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it was not so bad well she had two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of cat litter there
never and i lived in california which i feel like california you know anything can go on in california 
right and people do not see that either
right right i think that you get a much fairer deal with a jury than you do with a judge and that is that is been  my  experience and and i really think that i think that judges are very prejudice
it is telling them_n  yeah when we had um we had a cat when we first married no vocalized noise yeah we had the cat first and then we got um the chows and noise bring them_n bringing them in as puppies
did we did  what  do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really do not agree with that
russia goes in there well the main government in moscow goes in there and they kick everybody is ass
uh yes we do and we try to you know i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in you know every single day i am  at the computer
um hum and so i really think wei have tried to tone down
so that is why they are so um emotional about about statehood yet like you say it is
you know the afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad
and uh as far as the the party snacks uh i may fix a trail mix or a caramel popcorn for snacking as opposed to what pure peanuts
state school board
it is just wonderful after all these years of working
and in that case you know people are prone to getting any kind of you know weird cancer that only animals got before and yeah that sort of thing
well if you had a hundred bucks and you could not do anything except spend them on magazines what magazines would you would you get  would you would you buy
type of kids you know because it is starting to become new and and they are starting to find out more research about um this type of learning
you know someone to to be guilty for uh even though they are not or vice versa you know um but it is definitely something that would have to be watched very  closely if they decided to do it that way
they will is not that odd you would not think that that 
when we are going to get together and what we will be doing it is it is always been very very fun and  ii have always enjoyed it and uh we are very family oriented people and uh
air pollution
yeah you end up being your own person
i think it is a hundred years
and i uh help and learn and uh go that route but
do they
yeah it uh right survival becomes more of a priority than than than education and unfortunately you know  there is  uh there is and old joke about uh
i am  tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time
wow
we do not ever put it at a high risk it is just always gonna be there
it is it is it is an enormous  noise enormous bureaucracy though it is going to take probably years to really get that in to order too
um hum
you know and uh
real concerned about how they take care of that sort of thing i  i do not know all the details but they are really on top of that
what is that the i nn and central express
going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society
or three little girls
yeah but you know you ought to get him to go  pull the weeds
yeah this one is not that big it is a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you could not really sleep in there unless you sort of
you know pay an extra five percent or so
well that is good when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it and um we did not realize that there was a problem and after we moved in it was
no no i have not uh i had not tried in fact we were we were planting flowers  this  weekend so uh i was pretty tied up
and that is just one of the factors that goes into you know trying to get this place cleaned up but
you know youi have got as i said there is no incentive  incentive to go into vocalized noise i mean look at our state legislature and things where very nominal pay but there is also not you know
noise okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now
but i know they have a lot of drug problems so
right right right
but uh i am  a news reporter so i  i should get all i can my news from the news  from the tv
but just did not it did not it did not cover it
yeah we uh we were up there one year for a family reunion and it we went out on lake michigan noise and but the weather was so bad we could not go out very far and we did not stay out very long at all
because i i definitely  definitely need to make a little more money and uh i have not really accomplished that yet but i am  trying
you know and it is just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i do not use mine
yeah where have you gone there
do you think we should direct the government
are you sure you are not attracted to him or anything
i have uh bushes and stuff that really need trimming and um so uh
some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i would say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life
state so so where  where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in maryland vote for that
why should they be sitting  sitting in uh prison getting their college degree
noise uh um kind of a mauve and gray
terrific job back there i mean you know you  you pay for it too but it is it is like really worth it they are putting in a deck a redwood deck and it is just
there is a theater here in town that has uh been renovated by a foundation to its heyday of the twenties and it has the big old organ and everything and the big screen and they show only movies made before nineteen fifty
my youi have got a lot a lot of nothing out there
now how do they do the blackened
than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a
and i i am  not a great television watcher in in any respect uh but uh
uh that is okay
noise yeah there is a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems theyi have had with
all three and they unfortunately i bought them_n all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh
okay_n noise i am  sorry speaking of air pollution i am  vocalized noise coughing like a dog now um
and you can be talking to a customer service representative while you are looking at the pamphlet where with the magazine any questions you have you write to the editor and you have to wait for the answer
i do not know i guess i have a little bit more compassion i do think they ought to have their day in court
military things at a discount or something i do not get the idea  the idea of giving people three billion dollars a year
that is it
um no i  i  i live near baltimore and um
well yes and i work in south dallas for the dallas school system and uh uh uh do you know where oakland and hatcher are
that is reasonable i think
but you know it is that that is a very large chunk of
and wally moon is the manager of them_n  yeah so he is still kicking around 
noise so how do you feel about the vietnam war
there are too many children that are just conceived and produced and dropped on society
and stuff like that so um
oh i miss  i miss that 
and cook you know spaghetti with it  chili
the news from the comment because in the way it is presented their opinions is printed or presented as being the news
and we recently well we are we are through a proposition now where they are limiting class size to about twenty two i think and theyi have increased salaries and just done a major revision
and the and the announcers you know grabbing i mean it is like that was just something because that was like live and real
you have to noise it is a law i think that organizations
oh gosh so we are looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere closer closer to our families
and wo not take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you are saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that
you know wei have got kids twenty years old
yeah yeah lots of them_n lots of them_n and uh i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact it is called sundays at the moosewood restaurant and
that we got um at a store and it was missing a piece there is a a clip that goes with them that uh i guess
right exactly  before graduation
except for everything keeps going up you know and i know as a middle class um you know and also i have one dependent has
it is it is not always easy but it is uh it is very memorable  memorable boy i bet that is hard because i imagine that as a large family you were very close and and uh had a lot of fun as family
well i listen to a christian radio station and they were saying that cnn is definitely a world uh news service and uh
they had their regular um garbage or you know
our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out
and um it is always occurred to me that that um
before i came to texas but she is always she makes her corn bread and then of course you know she uses that to to make the stuffing we did not do that so much uh i am  from kind of like ohio area
vocalized noise those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal and of course
yeah ti people yeah and so i just figured no it is just this area you know
did send their kids to private schools i think they compare fairly  you know fairly well
okay i  i think we are started now
oh okay the first person ii have talked to outside of texas
and i do not have of course the equipment to do that so he took it into a shop and had it resurfaced  uh resurfaced and and fixed that way but yeah it is true uh you know
and then we get these professionals out of there and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than living off of us
yeah that is that is true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually
i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
you are a junior
have a hung jury i do not know if they the i do not guess they have to go back to
but  uh it just it seems to work pretty well in most cases then some cases like the manuel noriega trial i do not see how they could have found anybody in the country who did not have some opinion on that case
oh yeah it it looks uh halfway decent actually  first thing i did but
so you know you not only you know you are not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you are probably prolonging your life so there is no reason that we should not do it but i do not know
and uh my ford trucks have just ii have ii have just never had problems with them_n i honestly think i would die before my truck would kill over on me
and we do do that fact i was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom
i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year i think one of them_n died but i i got
yeah i actually
but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things so so that um seder is you know our our first seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which and five of them will be jewish
okay it is a book called life extensions there is also a book called the life extansion/extension extension companion uh dirk pearson and
and then i supplement that with uh
and uh so he is under contract now with uh an insurance company that has bought many agencies so uh
if they if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh they want to to format a report a certain way
uh it was it was a company um i think it was called credit union news or something
hum um yes yes
which i think is a is an invasion of privacy
uh they had out of town newspapers
so you know
well i never well  well i kind of know how to drive standard but ii have never owned one so i had not  i do not drive one a lot so i do not feel  feel comfortable in traffic with it
all of them with uh uh uh accreditation  accreditation to give the education
let is see uh some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and
eighty six i was amazed to hear that you know that is just the home games and i i thought it was a mistake but he goes no see eight
yeah yeah there is a couple of those ii have seen once in a while uh i ca not think of the name of the one that has the uh military
yeah well that sounds pretty yeah noise is it something uh that you could take a child to
okay
uh huh how how old are they
uh too often i think they are not and uh when you you  when you are
it is uh i teach in a college and i and i am  in a i am  in pretty good shape but some of these uh there is just a lot of people out of work lot of homeless
yeah and it is it is already gotten into  into brazil a little bit and it has to do with the fact that uh i mean in that part of the world they just dump raw sewage right into the rivers i mean things that we do not do here anymore because we know how bad it is for you
they are now criminals themselves yeah that is that is the crazy thing about it you are you are putting
oh really well good for you
yeah then you have to get up the next day and move it on
and it is uh oh it is just i do not know it is a it is a total free relaxation because hey you can do what you want you are a female and
oh i am  nola and i am  in plano texas
at all
uh it is it is at least something  you know it it i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really do not enjoy it but i know that i have to do it i mean it is just
yeah my my father was raising four kids  oh well three kids before he had me so it was uh
but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is
um and just the legal 
but uh i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things  you know the money was the issue
they supplied some uh you know they were some groups
but i can just forget that from now on i am  going to use i am  going to switch to the white ones
and i  i saw the movie born on the fourth of july and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times
well he has eight brothers and sisters so that is big by itself 
the work force with the the salaries that a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are um vice presidents of companies and i think with uh um
uh care givers are not
wei have gone other you know all kinds of places we go out to dinner we take the kids to the park and um noise
well noise since i just turned forty i am  thinking  about a forty year old man is car is something uh something real sporty but uh realistically with uh
this i guess in about a year and they are going to spend about a week and a half camping up there
i  i agree i  i am  capital the capital punishment is necessary in in many cases but
yeah and uh you know i have uh i  i have five children total and ii have got two out of the house already and i have  i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year
well i guess that is the bottom line if the children do know right from wrong
um certainly it it depends i mean here you in new jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax sort of value added tax on your utilities
i say we because_n i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh
yeah they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them_n over the top you know i do not really know what it is but but every team that is that is really good seems you know like the a is had they had they just had it all that one year so
and they have to stay in until they all agree noise yeah i do not know i am  not sure if they go i mean to twelve new people
use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you know you would not have this uh
and your  and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that
so i do not really need one in the aspect in the aspects
uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say noise
who are in pharmacy school and they could legally um provide medicine to their family mens family  family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now i  i  i believe
yeah that is what my brother was telling me that is good good news  good deal well uh how long were we supposed  i have not done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for
