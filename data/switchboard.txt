sw2005A-ms98-a-0023 208.998750 221.283375 finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know "like finding a a proper nursing home"

sw2038A-ms98-a-0018 162.480750 176.286250 "the government in power that" under what seem what seems to be popular support uh Sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts
sw2038A-ms98-a-0032 317.414750 332.050375 uh hundreds of years of Spanish control in the in the Spaniards have a horrible history of "corrupt uh government greedy uh" rulers who
sw2038A-ms98-a-0050 478.899250 488.625500 "organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem" and then be able to gradually transform back to a Democracy
sw2039A-ms98-a-0016 73.745000 79.962125 and i i'm not a great television watcher "in in any respect uh" but uh
sw2039A-ms98-a-0023 102.271250 106.945750 no uh "no uh no as a matter of fact"

sw2039B-ms98-a-0106 469.097375 470.109125 "really"
sw2040A-ms98-a-0005 57.683250 65.081875 i don't have "su[ch]- such close experience with" with um an area becoming a state as you do
sw2040A-ms98-a-0006 65.081875 78.004125 um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low st[andard]- uh "standard of living or at least um annual average income"
sw2040A-ms98-a-0007 78.004125 89.611750 um "part of this i suppose" is justified in i[n]- in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of th[e]- the more northern territories need
sw2040A-ms98-a-0050 427.745250 431.775625 "i i believe i would probably tend towards that"
sw2040A-ms98-a-0054 450.045250 457.522875 "right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language"
sw2040B-ms98-a-0008 42.356375 53.049875 "believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other"
sw2040B-ms98-a-0011 99.809250 101.683250 "oh that's very interesting"
sw2040B-ms98-a-0024 211.254625 219.607250 than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently "large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a"
sw2040B-ms98-a-0047 362.234375 370.079125 "um it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of" the problems relative to to uh economy
sw2040B-ms98-a-0067 461.365625 476.130750 i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions abou[t]- "against that decision" even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something
sw2040B-ms98-a-0070 491.713750 505.570750 am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but "i'm troubled by too close a clinging to" to the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
sw2041A-ms98-a-0038 140.572250 143.887375 "yeah would that we could" [laughter]
sw2041B-ms98-a-0004 11.945375 18.809500 and um is going to be "uh entering North Texas" for uh a kinesiology program there
sw2041B-ms98-a-0006 25.757500 36.298875 yeah so i'm i'm an avid aerobics [noise] uh person and just very very athletic "enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports"
sw2041B-ms98-a-0078 570.230750 583.601000 you're gonna have a lot of [vocalized-noise] more choices but "in urban areas it's" [laughter-you] [laughter-know] steak [laughter-places] [laughter-an] and it's not a you know it's uh it's definitely it it's it's changing to a degree but
sw2044B-ms98-a-0031 217.940625 222.189125 "came back here and could not realize why i'd been so depressed through the winter"
sw2051A-ms98-a-0069 361.532750 366.416000 "oh i'm i agree very much so on that i yeah"
sw2051B-ms98-a-0004 9.467125 10.673500 "where is that"
sw2051B-ms98-a-0030 96.069500 99.447625 "i formulated a pretty radical theory"
sw2051B-ms98-a-0037 110.366500 112.842000 a "pretty scary thought to me even"
sw2051B-ms98-a-0040 121.384000 122.760250 "just let them_1 go"
sw2051B-ms98-a-0071 199.602000 202.024250 "uh you serve your prison term"

sw2051B-ms98-a-0129 372.057500 373.846625 "for any reason"

sw2105B-ms98-a-0015 58.897500 62.056500 "i think it's more fun to play than it is to watch"

sw2113A-ms98-a-0062 223.626625 233.081875 really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this "beaten down path"
sw2113A-ms98-a-0067 243.610000 252.284000 yeah yeah it uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes "uh of of that movie"
sw2113A-ms98-a-0068 252.284000 257.591625 "it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real"
sw2113A-ms98-a-0069 257.591625 269.068125 "i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own" scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh-huh that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves
sw2113A-ms98-a-0071 272.107500 276.575625 "yeah right they just don't howl that much anymore"
sw2113B-ms98-a-0035 137.820125 139.626750 "um"

sw2114A-ms98-a-0015 83.148000 92.166750 "[vocalized-noise] they're they're putting more laws and more restrictions and more" burden on the honest citizen the one who doesn't give them a problem anyway
sw2114A-ms98-a-0025 157.554375 170.647625 "and which uh you know which maybe does cause some problems that maybe other countries with more restrictive laws don't have" but it's one of the prices that you have to pay for for freedom i think
sw2114A-ms98-a-0037 213.398000 225.210875 yeah you know and it's not for "uh not for protection or hunting or or anything just you know for all those reasons just you know nobody thinks anything about having a gun it's no big deal"
sw2118B-ms98-a-0023 160.155250 174.167625 tend to listen to most um i like the way they handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll have "you know five minutes worth of news every half hour"
sw2118B-ms98-a-0024 174.167625 183.696250 "but in the middle of the day they don't just drown you with the same old stuff and" they won't interrupt unless it's you know really important
sw2122A-ms98-a-0014 67.000000 69.297125 "but does it have uh like a disk drive"
sw2122A-ms98-a-0041 222.761125 223.830375 "yeah that"
sw2122A-ms98-a-0046 255.407500 267.073625 get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took "and then go back and see if that worked or not" but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four
sw2122A-ms98-a-0059 303.275750 309.090750 "they still had uh" it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in
sw2122B-ms98-a-0029 88.907750 101.509000 right yeah no i um i- i have both because that that's what i use all the time is Unix systems "um versus the DOS but then i teach DOS classes uh at night" uh-huh part time so

sw2124B-ms98-a-0025 114.659250 121.142625 it kind of [noise] kind of down played compared to what you'd like huh "do you find yourself um"
sw2124B-ms98-a-0026 121.142625 127.994000 "with all the um" cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain
sw2124B-ms98-a-0034 172.501375 173.839375 "uh-huh"
sw2125A-ms98-a-0049 311.535250 313.296625 "well that's true"
sw2129A-ms98-a-0002 0.696250 2.763375 "uh what kind of um"
sw2129A-ms98-a-0082 387.716750 394.851625 most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that "if somebody really needs that time"
sw2130A-ms98-a-0018 129.823375 135.605625 um "and uh i i gosh this uh" this whole thing now with all the uh
sw2130A-ms98-a-0027 159.726000 164.332125 "factors played a part in you know uh the" everyone was
sw2130A-ms98-a-0079 406.001125 412.302625 "one group of them" decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something
sw2130A-ms98-a-0086 443.530875 452.078500 yeah i know that that is almost "i mean that's absolutely unprecedented that was" an an incredible foreign policy
sw2130B-ms98-a-0082 457.133375 458.532000 "no"
sw2137B-ms98-a-0020 136.758875 147.021875 i think it would i[n]- in Israel the even the women are are required to to be in the military for a certain period of time "uh i was in the military"
sw2137B-ms98-a-0021 147.021875 155.108375 and i personally feel if th[ey]- if they have dra[ft]- "the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men"
sw2139B-ms98-a-0007 15.149625 17.527125 "biggest thing i" f[ind]-
sw2139B-ms98-a-0008 17.527125 19.739625 f[ind]- "find is the"
sw2139B-ms98-a-0027 79.896750 84.697500 "which i think is a is an invasion of privacy"
sw2139B-ms98-a-0066 236.589250 238.484125 and "i get mail"
sw2141B-ms98-a-0085 245.123750 251.365500 yeah well that sounds pretty yeah [noise] "is it something uh that you could take a child to"
sw2145A-ms98-a-0006 67.243375 76.194500 i agree um the equality of uh "the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically"
sw2145A-ms98-a-0070 378.609375 380.391125 "you know they're"
sw2145A-ms98-a-0076 402.783375 411.951500 and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home "sick"
sw2145A-ms98-a-0077 411.951500 416.380250 "i mean that is you know just a" a rate that you have to pay
sw2145A-ms98-a-0087 435.082375 436.468625 "i um"
sw2145B-ms98-a-0002 2.397625 4.168000 "well i guess i would"
sw2145B-ms98-a-0003 4.168000 12.150125 "first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having" seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that
sw2145B-ms98-a-0013 56.281125 61.422750 "uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place"
sw2145B-ms98-a-0025 156.805125 162.916125 "with children in that situation i i guess one knows one's own [storly/story] and i know"
sw2145B-ms98-a-0026 162.916125 169.592250 "uh in my children's case it was" one where uh pretty much up until
sw2145B-ms98-a-0039 214.944000 217.677875 i don't know "whether"
sw2145B-ms98-a-0088 464.128500 473.549500 i'm i'm noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming [vocalized-noise] emerging called solo parents "that i am very aware of"
sw2145B-ms98-a-0094 496.017125 501.532750 well i think "we're about done okay" uh good bye
sw2149A-ms98-a-0016 111.989750 124.498750 well we have a funny commercial around here it says something like if people were to give "five hours a week or five percent of their salary" we could they could solve all the world's problems or something
sw2149A-ms98-a-0018 136.712125 142.478125 "substitute my" my yeah my kid'll do uh four or five hours this week for me no problem
sw2149A-ms98-a-0052 387.960500 400.464625 yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because_1 there were all different "organizations to do there was Big Brother Big Sister" they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group
sw2149B-ms98-a-0003 11.484000 24.464500 to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them_1 i guess involved with community maybe you know just community activity "if nothing else see how the" city works stuff like that
sw2149B-ms98-a-0005 26.289125 39.497875 yeah i [laughter] i think so too i think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it it's a good idea to get them_1 involved in the city and community activities and "you know like the uh shelters and"
sw2152A-ms98-a-0038 123.819875 133.310750 and the the home uh "the family type unit you know and i think when kids have that they don't [noise] get into as much trouble or seek to"
sw2152A-ms98-a-0066 237.905500 241.773125 "do without and that kind of stuff where it's now the credit cards and"
sw2152A-ms98-a-0084 302.588125 306.455000 "or mothers to children you know because they're able to spend some time"
sw2154A-ms98-a-0013 61.352625 68.943375 for "for" local news i think we do real well where it's we live in a kind of small town
sw2154A-ms98-a-0091 440.533125 446.026000 that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary "real quick"
sw2154A-ms98-a-0108 508.360875 510.403250 "i try to catch it"
sw2154B-ms98-a-0003 10.985625 13.979125 "and then i supplement that with uh"
sw2154B-ms98-a-0008 22.822625 25.184625 "and a newspaper if i have time"
sw2154B-ms98-a-0052 344.956625 347.447375 "fill-ins you know" [laughter]
sw2154B-ms98-a-0066 428.337750 436.821625 uh "here's what went on in Asia" over the past week and there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs
sw2154B-ms98-a-0073 493.800250 497.703000 "well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway"
sw2154B-ms98-a-0084 579.799375 585.657875 well it does sound very interesting "maybe our phone company out here will get around to" offering something like that
sw2157A-ms98-a-0018 39.707750 42.006625 "okay i think i did know that"
sw2157A-ms98-a-0059 243.340250 252.540250 "because_1 now" now you know he had a shot and and didn't look too good and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more
sw2157A-ms98-a-0067 307.114875 312.458375 you know keep him uh "from reinjuring anything but"
sw2157A-ms98-a-0074 337.996625 345.800500 what [laughter] oh "okay [laughter]" maybe i'll call you back after [laughter] after the recording is finished
sw2157A-ms98-a-0091 399.183125 401.802375 "back when they were in Saint Louis"
sw2157A-ms98-a-0093 404.649875 409.119625 "[laughter] since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been uh"
sw2157A-ms98-a-0103 463.155250 466.996500 that are going to uh "do pretty good i think"

sw2157B-ms98-a-0066 300.253750 303.867625 "i don't know" [noise] yeah think it was
sw2157B-ms98-a-0084 373.887500 379.484500 "actually when i was younger i was a Cardinal fan too" remember Jim Hart
sw2158A-ms98-a-0015 40.837000 48.042375 "and so he saw it there and he just said" you guys want to make some money and talk five minutes a day here you go so
sw2158A-ms98-a-0045 161.503750 163.989250 "well i i got a stopwatch here"

sw2162A-ms98-a-0093 393.108125 405.900000 they'd have references to literature and things like that and they'd also just have odd thing they walk into a bank vault and there is a deer head "lying on the [laughter-table]" [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-bank] [laughter-vault]
sw2164A-ms98-a-0008 31.116250 35.726000 "i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"
sw2164A-ms98-a-0013 50.992000 54.323250 "you know someone who who really has no remorse"
sw2164A-ms98-a-0049 183.686125 185.617250 "yeah really"

sw2165B-ms98-a-0122 582.476875 590.958125 [laughter] "yeah i know my husband he'll cook every once in a while but like the kitchen is a disaster area afterwards"
sw2167A-ms98-a-0075 209.735250 214.682250 "well do you agree with that requirement that they meet those uh academic"
sw2167A-ms98-a-0085 275.523625 276.646000 "uh-huh"

sw2168A-ms98-a-0119 562.860375 571.191000 "we don't get that [laughter-okay]" if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most
sw2171A-ms98-a-0054 233.211375 240.982250 um-hum "well you know uh i know American Expre[ss]- i'm no[w]-" i'm working at American Express now and they
sw2171A-ms98-a-0073 307.147875 312.735625 i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean i[n]- you know when they're "in the college"
sw2171A-ms98-a-0079 329.776000 335.020500 but i think a lot of it's you know when the "people get older they'll do something like that"
sw2171A-ms98-a-0117 498.571875 503.701500 that's the way i use them_1 uh i tr[y]- "i try to make sure i don't get in debt so"
sw2172A-ms98-a-0040 134.988375 136.488375 "oh yeah"
sw2172A-ms98-a-0084 286.427625 287.475250 "yeah"

sw2176B-ms98-a-0008 22.322500 29.429500 "[noise]" um not that old three or four years old maybe and uh he he really enjoys it so
sw2178A-ms98-a-0036 145.954875 154.289500 "oh yeah" [laughter] that's strictly for entertainment [laughter] that was just [laughter] it was
sw2180A-ms98-a-0028 255.778625 268.589125 if the criminal chooses to have a three panel judge uh a three judge panel i should say i think he can "have that rather than trial by jury"
sw2180B-ms98-a-0012 76.948500 86.238625 and it's just that i think they're just tying up the "um whole judicial process" um there's a lot of things they could do
sw2181A-ms98-a-0064 304.372000 306.659875 "yeah it it's a little disturbing"
sw2181A-ms98-a-0091 511.572500 520.211000 tend to be hypercritical "of these things" and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um
sw2181A-ms98-a-0099 547.473625 552.528625 "yeah they leave they leave some songs with you they leave" i don't know what it is

sw2181B-ms98-a-0040 167.644375 172.700375 "and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown"
sw2181B-ms98-a-0093 362.301375 364.475750 "yeah it's true"
sw2181B-ms98-a-0138 556.914125 558.737125 "no it could be"
sw2181B-ms98-a-0147 578.959625 583.487625 "oh okay the first person i've talked to outside of Texas"
sw2182B-ms98-a-0041 321.486500 328.705375 "it's it's really difficult to put two p[erson]- a male and a" female in the same role in the same circumstances
sw2182B-ms98-a-0043 337.323625 350.638000 you know even between a same sexes in a different in the same role there would there would be differences in the way one guy handled something over the way another guy would handle it "so i- i think when you put a male and a female in"
sw2182B-ms98-a-0047 373.776875 377.449125 "when" when you're raised that way [vocalized-noise]
sw2184A-ms98-a-0012 45.219750 54.535125 "uh i work for a tire company" Modern Tire and uh it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our uh injuries occur
sw2184A-ms98-a-0076 299.413000 305.313375 "i mean you know there's all kinds of" drawbacks much less the drug testing
sw2184A-ms98-a-0103 368.569000 370.511375 "but they weren't"
sw2184B-ms98-a-0084 349.276125 359.248125 and that's really that's really frightening so i think some place "you know" places like that it should be like mandatory like you know
sw2185B-ms98-a-0020 115.893875 125.007125 [laughter] [laughter-every] [laughter-time] [laughter-the] [laughter-sun] [laughter-would] [laughter-come] [laughter-up] in the morning i'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh "we've learned we're we uh"
sw2185B-ms98-a-0078 381.185625 395.499875 "yeah it's it's been uh" we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just
sw2185B-ms98-a-0093 471.997000 481.486750 no no i haven't uh i hadn't tried in fact we were "we were planting flowers [laughter-this] [laughter-weekend]" so uh i was pretty tied up
sw2185B-ms98-a-0113 586.497375 595.717375 yeah i i've [vocalized-noise] "i've seen uh" they're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths
sw2186B-ms98-a-0060 313.865500 320.007375 we were we "our business was on the other side of the island we were only in San Juan it was at night"
sw2186B-ms98-a-0061 320.007375 324.264000 "they don't want us go out on the beach you know said it was very dangerous"
sw2186B-ms98-a-0067 353.970625 361.091875 so that's why they're so um "emotional about about statehood yet like you say it's"
sw2186B-ms98-a-0068 361.091875 363.801250 "they can't really support themselves" so
sw2186B-ms98-a-0074 379.743875 381.425125 "[laughter]"
sw2186B-ms98-a-0075 381.425125 385.794000 "yeah but the thing the thing that bothers me about it the most is"
sw2187A-ms98-a-0030 182.496000 191.699250 "yeah i have two nieces and they they they" go melt some chocolate chips [laughter] go buy me some strawberries
sw2187A-ms98-a-0040 239.755750 247.995250 so um do you want to discuss your recipe i have a recipe if you want [laughter] "um it filled"
sw2187A-ms98-a-0066 453.999125 460.658500 i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk "or or a regular beater" but um
sw2187A-ms98-a-0082 581.481125 592.138750 but um i my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard that's yeah so [laughter] "that's why i do that"
sw2187B-ms98-a-0010 66.262000 67.715000 "right"
sw2189A-ms98-a-0005 29.719000 41.827750 "so they had uh they're having actually a special on today" and they were mentioning that and even though Kansas City may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike
sw2189A-ms98-a-0049 248.952750 251.599250 that's "way too much yes it has"
sw2189A-ms98-a-0055 264.535750 279.354250 really well there's been uh actually some pretty [noise] interesting interesting topics that i've had i've had things from uh tax reform "to baseball to fishing those are the three i've participated in"
sw2190A-ms98-a-0027 137.815625 139.916750 "no okay yeah"
sw2190A-ms98-a-0067 343.399250 344.653875 "yeah"
sw2190A-ms98-a-0084 435.735750 441.445000 "yeah" i- i think uh there could be a lot of peo[ple]- i thi[nk]- people close this is really we're
sw2190B-ms98-a-0093 504.674375 508.645875 "well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon"
sw2191A-ms98-a-0042 151.369500 153.978000 "but i like to um" [noise]
sw2191B-ms98-a-0011 88.390000 101.230500 "last night i did" [noise] about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips
sw2193A-ms98-a-0002 6.349000 14.444625 well i have noticed a lot uh "more women's roles at work which i like in management"
sw2193A-ms98-a-0099 331.990125 342.379625 but i don't know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we're not used to having i'm not used to having women "in in roles like that you know as role models"
sw2193A-ms98-a-0109 365.734375 367.562000 "do they"
sw2193A-ms98-a-0128 418.155125 423.504750 "you know woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that"
sw2193A-ms98-a-0129 423.504750 432.627000 "so that's going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because_1 a lot of times you know you do look at the men and they never seem to show any emotion" they just
sw2194B-ms98-a-0016 52.278750 63.973750 to do uh spreadsheet analysis for various uh businesses that we're studying and also uh you know it hooks up to normal printers "and what have you" and uh works pretty well in that mode as well
sw2196B-ms98-a-0045 341.592875 348.318500 "i don't really like that too well i keep telling my husband that our next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land [laughter]"
sw2196B-ms98-a-0052 385.486125 398.120625 but there "uh w[ell]- as a first time home buyer i know what you mean there's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for" the only really trouble we've had with our house is the seals breaking between the double panes and wa[ter]- moisture
sw2196B-ms98-a-0078 507.519875 513.662125 "yeah well what they did is just" they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in
sw2197B-ms98-a-0003 11.540000 14.329375 "i'd encourage it"
sw2197B-ms98-a-0016 60.378625 65.754875 "that stage in their life uh other people it uh" it's
sw2197B-ms98-a-0018 69.966125 76.179250 it it depends on the person "on the individual but uh the one factor i think"
sw2197B-ms98-a-0038 148.503000 155.862125 "here in central New York is uh" Hamilton College is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south
sw2197B-ms98-a-0075 330.607500 337.175500 and uh "that's another" big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for
sw2197B-ms98-a-0098 410.754625 417.483125 and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that "[laughter-i] [laughter-think] [laughter-i've] [laughter-ever] [laughter-run] [laughter-into]" even even more so
sw2197B-ms98-a-0105 452.189875 456.612750 degrees "but but their undergrads are like"
sw2197B-ms98-a-0144 584.705500 587.661375 don't ever "ever consider"
sw2198B-ms98-a-0081 427.360375 437.983875 yeah yeah if you like Plat[oon]- "yeah if you liked Platoon you'll probably really like this because it takes pretty much the same" direction for the time you know uh i think
sw2198B-ms98-a-0115 562.018750 571.268375 you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right "off the screen"
sw2203B-ms98-a-0014 61.707375 69.474750 yeah like where does all the good stuff go "yeah where is it i know they have to grow some of" it
sw2203B-ms98-a-0055 215.998375 223.496250 uh-huh oh my husband just has to have it green "has to be green" it's
sw2203B-ms98-a-0066 253.984125 256.323125 "do you oh not me"
sw2203B-ms98-a-0124 429.986375 443.946500 [laughter] "i had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were out of their house because of the" ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and
sw2204B-ms98-a-0007 51.994000 64.300750 but "in terms of i well" the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for uh certain crimes
sw2204B-ms98-a-0066 334.606375 338.821250 "yes i am on staff to Hal Ammon to GTE"
sw2205A-ms98-a-0003 17.499750 27.997125 [noise] "well not in the morning but um" if the well i have two s[on]- children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll
sw2205A-ms98-a-0013 90.948375 105.465125 well [laughter] he didn't have too good of opinion of it no "i mean yes i did hear that and so um" i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor
sw2205A-ms98-a-0050 325.725500 336.241625 a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female anchors "and i like different" i like the anchors to be different kinds of people
sw2205B-ms98-a-0009 83.951375 91.998125 "did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage"
sw2205B-ms98-a-0056 474.981500 478.491500 "[laughter-okay] well good talking to you" good night
sw2206B-ms98-a-0056 221.996125 223.634000 "goodness"

sw2206B-ms98-a-0155 539.352625 542.490125 "seems like it was extra cold last night though"
sw2220A-ms98-a-0057 361.289500 364.306625 "okay so we're in Garland"
sw2221A-ms98-a-0022 94.467250 102.998125 "yeah i don't know i- i think" that uh i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked however
sw2221A-ms98-a-0024 103.981875 118.303125 "yeah" it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it y[ou]- give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong
sw2221A-ms98-a-0025 118.303125 130.259250 or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier "than twelve people could"
sw2221A-ms98-a-0053 278.959000 286.581000 "and when the parole officer calls to check on them" they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it
sw2221A-ms98-a-0064 334.277250 338.661250 "and they have a job in jail" and they work
sw2221B-ms98-a-0003 15.962000 20.419750 "but" you know it's pretty hard to try let's say
sw2221B-ms98-a-0068 376.625500 388.973000 and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know "yeah" but i know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much
sw2223B-ms98-a-0033 257.841750 264.759625 i mean they they uh go home and grade papers lesson plans "prepare for the next day"
sw2226A-ms98-a-0021 89.474125 97.273750 "five okay he's written some children's books as well and they're all spiritually" uh oriented yeah
sw2226A-ms98-a-0024 108.951000 117.492375 yeah oh they're good they're great "and it's uh like uh" uh usually about a family of um
sw2226A-ms98-a-0071 285.124000 286.467125 "you know that"
sw2226B-ms98-a-0069 230.937125 232.720875 "Judith Krantz"
sw2226B-ms98-a-0070 232.720875 235.780750 "Judith Krantz" i know her
sw2226B-ms98-a-0098 321.146750 327.528875 but uh most of the time they don't with when follow books very well "when they make them into movies"

sw2227A-ms98-a-0064 263.765000 273.882125 "because by the play time is" when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit
sw2227A-ms98-a-0071 305.210875 315.725375 "so" and i also uh my father works for IBM and we came up here we well we came to the United States in nineteen seventy six seventy seven

sw2228B-ms98-a-0035 171.903625 175.220125 i just i'm rather puzzled about the "whole thing" [laughter]
sw2228B-ms98-a-0077 395.665750 398.857250 federal guaranty "program"
sw2228B-ms98-a-0081 416.148750 419.483875 "the possibility exists for for these sorts of"
sw2230A-ms98-a-0005 16.734375 21.769750 "figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal"
sw2230A-ms98-a-0120 555.891375 559.538375 "that uh you know why vote when it's decided already"
sw2231A-ms98-a-0068 265.661875 267.012750 "uh-huh"
sw2231B-ms98-a-0032 159.563500 168.288750 there's [noise] should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty you killed "someone" you know in cold blood or whatever this is what's going to happen
sw2231B-ms98-a-0048 240.037500 244.447875 "and are now" now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty
sw2231B-ms98-a-0049 244.447875 258.011875 for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them "like Manson who's come up"
sw2232B-ms98-a-0048 313.827000 326.989000 "i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian" economy like South Vietnam was that in reality uh the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes
sw2233B-ms98-a-0017 68.191125 72.046000 "the city schools are some of the models for the rest of the country"
sw2233B-ms98-a-0039 176.045000 179.418500 "and um it's always occurred to me that that um"
sw2233B-ms98-a-0040 179.418500 183.505250 you know i mean so looking at it s[o]- all "so i have some bias in this"
sw2233B-ms98-a-0044 200.758625 207.364000 i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think we're "lacking in some very specific areas"
sw2233B-ms98-a-0094 455.248125 462.875625 "yeah i- i- i have" i mean you say that your your kids are grown up and out of school now and i've yet to have any so
sw2234A-ms98-a-0007 42.706125 50.676000 "i thought it was really" you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your gro[ceries]- groceries and
sw2234A-ms98-a-0007 42.706125 50.676000 i thought it was really you know kind of "a pretty good deal not" to have to pay tax on your gro[ceries]- groceries and
sw2234A-ms98-a-0016 120.999000 132.496875 are living pretty pretty good life styles but they're not paying income tax "and that's not fair" to me and there's you know some people who uh are abusing
sw2234A-ms98-a-0055 329.939250 344.495375 in that even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they "um they wouldn't be able to enjoy the"
sw2234A-ms98-a-0074 481.945250 490.757250 and not "anyway" well [laughter] [laughter-i] guess i better let you go

sw2237B-ms98-a-0014 58.971625 64.979250 "but then i have to wait for my" tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
sw2237B-ms98-a-0017 72.757375 82.482375 yeah we've had just a few you know freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of April "and it's pretty tough"
sw2237B-ms98-a-0106 419.353000 422.494750 "and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball"
sw2237B-ms98-a-0129 531.289750 534.991875 "yeah see mine are up and bloomed already"
sw2237B-ms98-a-0132 541.940000 546.200000 yeah and then "in in my back flower bed i have uh"
sw2237B-ms98-a-0139 571.194375 576.778125 well do you all have a "what kind of grass" do you grow up there do you grow uh Bermuda or rye or
sw2237B-ms98-a-0144 591.982250 597.013125 Bermuda seems to be "yeah Bermuda seems to do pretty good" down here
sw2241A-ms98-a-0014 65.512125 70.862375 "seems like it" uh the place we've been living at it's uh we're we're just leasing in
sw2241A-ms98-a-0019 88.912750 90.813875 "it was it was"
sw2241A-ms98-a-0070 318.289125 323.564250 "that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the the way they behave"
sw2241A-ms98-a-0082 356.253250 360.646250 "but uh but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime"
sw2241A-ms98-a-0123 545.357750 553.546250 like after it's been raining for a few months they say the roots have developed so that's all they work on "just a leafy they don't do anything"
sw2241B-ms98-a-0027 114.725625 122.896250 yeah we've we've got mayb[e]- maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil "and then it's solid rock from then on down so" [laughter]
sw2241B-ms98-a-0040 180.994000 190.979750 "i never really" messed with anything uh gardening or anything like that until now but uh i- i keep hearing all the stories of of different parts of town
sw2241B-ms98-a-0041 190.979750 198.014625 "in fact uh we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that"

sw2290A-ms98-a-0028 113.446875 118.659375 "nothing i think i've been trout fishing once" uh
sw2290A-ms98-a-0052 185.616750 190.404375 "[laughter-that's] right i i've never caught" that much but uh
sw2290A-ms98-a-0076 294.769250 299.400000 i did not even i did not even "i have been"
sw2290A-ms98-a-0080 310.724250 313.106625 "everyone on the boat"
sw2290A-ms98-a-0115 494.954875 496.377375 "some of the"
sw2290A-ms98-a-0122 530.785750 542.307750 up to uh i guess the la[rgest]- largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things "just terrible"
sw2291B-ms98-a-0052 288.142500 299.147875 uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my "my personal feelings is that parents" need to be taking more responsibility
sw2291B-ms98-a-0062 354.916125 367.520250 "yeah it's it's the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that" the parents be able to have a choice saying i don't like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where they'll be properly uh
sw2291B-ms98-a-0073 419.804875 430.980375 and you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work you you just "you you want to rest for a little while and" maybe the children uh don't want you to rest
sw2292B-ms98-a-0013 75.399000 86.786750 it was um not that kind of HMO's "where you have to go to their" they're sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an HMO where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular
sw2292B-ms98-a-0044 249.780250 252.229000 "oh yes you're not kidding"
sw2293B-ms98-a-0050 293.470375 305.309875 it it could go on for years and years until they they s[tart]- start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing "it's doing some damage and" and something's got to be done
sw2294B-ms98-a-0012 91.967000 97.985625 "second trip down whether it's for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day"
sw2294B-ms98-a-0027 318.486125 322.287000 "that should be automatic death penalty no" if ands or buts
sw2294B-ms98-a-0048 522.297250 524.990250 "yeah i've been with them for about four years now"
sw2295B-ms98-a-0011 63.075125 76.294125 "but um" we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me
sw2295B-ms98-a-0011 63.075125 76.294125 but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real "out of it all the time" and that's always kind of bothered me
sw2295B-ms98-a-0020 123.100875 131.542625 well sometimes you don't have any other alternative after all "family and friends are usually" well family's tied up with
sw2297A-ms98-a-0057 263.366625 269.449750 so they they needed an audible method of defining when brakes were needed so they "came up with that"
sw2297B-ms98-a-0110 521.584250 523.639000 "okay so uh"
sw2302B-ms98-a-0018 145.349375 159.936875 "and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing" but the way our system our court system works that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
sw2302B-ms98-a-0023 206.689375 213.677250 you know kind of deltaing off what what we've been talking about here uh "i believe that"
sw2302B-ms98-a-0028 248.827625 256.907750 "need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge" Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let
sw2303B-ms98-a-0019 165.890125 169.673375 and i believe in this "but"
sw2304A-ms98-a-0036 121.129250 126.726125 "yes so that mu[st]-" that's before your time your parents might remember if they were here then
sw2304B-ms98-a-0069 223.669875 234.212500 because i was uh you know it's like when when you go buy fish you know like well like i buy like the fish that you can do in the microwave "you know the breaded fish and you know i've seen you know the filet"
sw2304B-ms98-a-0080 267.564750 275.718250 "okay because i got i got um one of those little" uh microwaves the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water
sw2305A-ms98-a-0006 54.773875 69.574125 yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's it's your core education "your general requi[rements]- general education requirements" um
sw2305A-ms98-a-0066 397.926875 409.687500 um but it's such a grind "and you begin to wonder you know" if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer
sw2306A-ms98-a-0003 7.265125 21.980500 i happen to be a mystery fan and uh "programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are m[y]- my favorite kinds of programs"
sw2306A-ms98-a-0026 96.816375 103.344125 "probably things that that there happen every day and we don't even notice them until someone videotapes them_1"
sw2306A-ms98-a-0124 575.479875 588.222875 yes "sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a Czechoslovakian Turner Society" and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and
sw2307A-ms98-a-0006 17.612500 20.887500 "um-hum real close" New Mexico anyway
sw2307A-ms98-a-0051 266.703750 276.846625 winter "um now south of here" uh like in Houston i did even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter
sw2308A-ms98-a-0005 27.497000 29.748500 "so um"
sw2308A-ms98-a-0052 511.973000 526.688625 i mean and of course it's institutional food and everybody hates it and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight [laughter] it "it's really it's bad thing"
sw2308B-ms98-a-0023 259.686500 267.999000 and uh bought her all brand new stuff and they they had called a home where they you know "where they were on a waiting list to get into there"
sw2308B-ms98-a-0030 315.241875 326.956000 and uh you know it was a real hush hush thing and then i was i was wondering why my mother always referred to you know "his second wife as that hussy" [laughter]
sw2308B-ms98-a-0032 350.999500 352.227750 "yeah"
sw2309A-ms98-a-0067 289.514000 291.282125 "yeah i"
sw2309B-ms98-a-0008 34.099625 43.103875 sometimes i think the jury is ignorant "in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion"
sw2309B-ms98-a-0012 52.007625 64.997000 no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the aff[ixing]- aff[ixing]- affixing of punishment "and fines and things of that nature"
sw2309B-ms98-a-0018 106.841375 108.982375 "you know the death penalty and such"
sw2309B-ms98-a-0070 299.779125 307.491250 "yeah although i guess it's your you want them_1 to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time"
sw2309B-ms98-a-0088 365.671000 367.053250 "nice talking to you also"
sw2310B-ms98-a-0050 213.823500 220.690375 so the winters would get "fairly cold the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would"
sw2311A-ms98-a-0026 170.661875 180.347250 [laughter] yep but that's what's you have when when you have to deal with the public or deal with the customers they "like that that business" su[it]- suit
sw2311A-ms98-a-0047 306.691250 321.377125 but we work in an electronics field and "we have to wear polyester smocks so it's usually um a tank top in the Summer" and then silk and polyester are the only things that are close enough to being dressy
sw2311A-ms98-a-0067 475.974000 485.743250 and now it's very slow and i pretty much i've taken a couple courses and no[w]- now i sit at my desk and i "and i read read my courses"
sw2311A-ms98-a-0070 506.034250 508.477000 "yeah this"
sw2314B-ms98-a-0030 152.725750 157.619000 "oh i see how'd how did they" how do they pick their people
sw2314B-ms98-a-0046 217.875750 219.865625 "right right"
sw2314B-ms98-a-0075 366.969500 369.420125 "right right"
sw2315A-ms98-a-0025 175.123000 187.470500 yeah i've heard that that's a really good way to get cars up here th[ey]- "they only come around" like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don't um
sw2315A-ms98-a-0067 513.301875 523.322750 "it was pretty much" it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old Volvo
sw2315A-ms98-a-0068 523.322750 532.054500 "and at that time i was going to college and" i liked to go camping and {bajaing} and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it
sw2315A-ms98-a-0072 547.801125 561.481750 because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them_1 because they know that they deal and sell them_1 [laughter] "yes my father's very shrewd with them" [laughter]
sw2316A-ms98-a-0006 27.631125 30.595250 "yes well yeah i am"
sw2316A-ms98-a-0041 337.552875 346.554375 because your parents are engineers or chemists "they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you"
sw2316A-ms98-a-0050 431.590750 443.754375 we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five "people are going whoa"
sw2316A-ms98-a-0068 552.979375 553.544500 "well that"
sw2316B-ms98-a-0032 215.361375 215.952500 "and"
sw2316B-ms98-a-0036 237.997625 245.508625 yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but "most of them_1 just want to go play"
sw2316B-ms98-a-0042 302.688250 309.833375 "i say we because_1 i live here" if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
sw2317A-ms98-a-0115 344.731500 346.882750 "Victoria Holt is that right"
sw2317A-ms98-a-0144 413.496250 414.953250 "yeah"
sw2318A-ms98-a-0011 57.541125 68.619750 i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men "or women to death before i mean"
sw2318A-ms98-a-0038 245.406625 250.365000 "does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live"
sw2318A-ms98-a-0055 317.192250 327.892125 "um" the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we're we're a really we're uh pampered up here
sw2323B-ms98-a-0008 41.055500 51.698875 right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US d[uring]- during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners "and kill them as soon as they got them"
sw2323B-ms98-a-0015 101.931500 112.969000 but yet the the government that's in Moscow "told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn't go in there and try to save those people"
sw2323B-ms98-a-0022 152.003625 165.395125 you know it's like they it seems like they can their "their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering"
sw2324A-ms98-a-0013 49.544250 50.652125 "right"
sw2324A-ms98-a-0055 265.609500 269.455500 "right it is" because_1 it is another language yeah
sw2324B-ms98-a-0004 7.736375 20.662000 i- i- i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general "um" background the history of our country has been inches and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system
sw2324B-ms98-a-0024 136.008000 140.295875 measurement on there "you know from one system to the other" in seconds
sw2325A-ms98-a-0069 346.061000 347.106750 "oh"
sw2325A-ms98-a-0081 434.147000 442.897375 i know i was just like God set this up for me he [laughter-knew] i needed this and uh [noise] "so since October then they've been going there and"
sw2325B-ms98-a-0033 122.964000 129.180125 that's the hardest thing i think you know to to deal with is that people love your "kids i put um"
sw2325B-ms98-a-0055 276.505250 281.230750 "so you had to come home and clean" before you could even do anything probably
sw2326B-ms98-a-0011 22.097375 27.200375 "uh i didn't really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars"
sw2326B-ms98-a-0020 56.893375 62.906625 "hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go American because everybody know has got a American made truck"
sw2328B-ms98-a-0052 305.498625 313.103000 well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it "there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like"
sw2330A-ms98-a-0021 97.054125 106.632875 yeah that's probably a [vocalized-noise] a little bit under "what it is for this time of year i- i think" i haven't seen the weath[er]- the n[ews]- the weather
sw2330A-ms98-a-0040 186.089250 191.986250 yeah [noise] "one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year"
sw2331A-ms98-a-0049 258.470375 269.797375 "twosome or threesome" you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying well you know let me tea[ch]- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
sw2331A-ms98-a-0049 258.470375 269.797375 twosome or threesome you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying "well you know let me tea[ch]- tell you how to do that or" teach you how to do that or
sw2331A-ms98-a-0066 344.411250 355.459125 well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside "give her something to do that we both enjoy so"
sw2331B-ms98-a-0003 1.890500 6.308125 "uh i like to think i am it's it's been a while now" [laughter]
sw2331B-ms98-a-0051 211.377000 225.366375 oh it i[s]- it's it's a lot of fun e[specially]- especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest "thing well about that['s]- that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or"
sw2331B-ms98-a-0085 354.391750 365.286000 yeah it it sounds like we've got real similar situations "uh i i go home uh i've gone home every year now since i've moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh"
sw2331B-ms98-a-0089 380.772250 383.120750 "it's uh that's interesting" though
sw2332B-ms98-a-0069 281.297625 283.520250 "but if you're smoking"
sw2332B-ms98-a-0128 480.094500 484.168375 "but you know the[re's]- there's the difference because_1 uh they say you know"
sw2334A-ms98-a-0021 82.745500 93.488500 "yeah course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because_1 i was selling it i wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it"
sw2334A-ms98-a-0024 100.774000 104.518375 "all that other good stuff that ate them_1 all up"
sw2334A-ms98-a-0048 171.970625 181.250625 "and the bill would come in and i'd pay it" and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay
sw2334A-ms98-a-0052 195.236125 201.102375 "so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed"

sw2334A-ms98-a-0083 308.697000 313.275875 "naturally that's i got in all kinds of trouble doing that" [laughter]
sw2334A-ms98-a-0096 361.368125 367.167625 yeah i could use a discount [laughter] i have to wait for things to "go on sale" [laughter] [noise]

sw2336B-ms98-a-0075 401.934250 412.669125 i am not really crazy about driving i never have been "since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young" when i was sixteen
sw2336B-ms98-a-0079 426.410375 431.444875 "and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive"
sw2336B-ms98-a-0083 450.764375 457.666375 well whe[n]- it's it's very easy when you get a top[ic]- you "get on a topic that you know you enjoy" and
sw2337A-ms98-a-0096 461.452625 467.625500 and do you fly into Camgonias or "the other one down there down south"

sw2340A-ms98-a-0096 491.560000 504.532000 "and we keep thinking about that you know" because_1 she they get less alert and they don't care and i've seen some of these elderly people on TV you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know
sw2340B-ms98-a-0031 92.986625 94.570875 "isn't that neat"

sw2342B-ms98-a-0078 410.140875 423.884875 but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things so so that um Seder's you know our our first Seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which "and five of them will be Jewish"
sw2344A-ms98-a-0043 199.686000 204.918625 the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb [laughter] "i don't know though"
sw2344A-ms98-a-0046 224.075875 231.520000 "yeah that that's real scary actually" i mean i- i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but
sw2344A-ms98-a-0063 297.545750 299.085625 "you've read that one before"
sw2344A-ms98-a-0083 402.877125 407.335500 "somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the Baltic States"

sw2349A-ms98-a-0071 201.384625 208.668875 but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say "let's do this you know"
sw2349B-ms98-a-0009 47.666375 50.094750 "to get out there and do so"
sw2350A-ms98-a-0031 84.449250 87.658250 "yeah we're not from Texas either um"
sw2350A-ms98-a-0053 135.577750 141.368750 i guess we bought that my car in Colorado that's where we we moved from "and uh"

sw2350A-ms98-a-0135 420.468375 425.797000 and he was lethargic "he really he wasn't used to the heat at all" he
sw2352A-ms98-a-0018 62.795750 73.586750 well our libraries "and then the uh" Wal-Mart stores have the bins in back of them_1 and when you recycle glass
sw2352A-ms98-a-0033 146.080250 152.176250 "and they are s[aying]-" our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the United States
sw2352A-ms98-a-0060 256.402125 257.654625 "oh really"
sw2352A-ms98-a-0083 359.051500 365.534250 well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen "work for so little money"
sw2352A-ms98-a-0104 425.414750 430.955625 y[eah]- that's correct turtle is very good that's the other thing wrong with "the poor turtles" [laughter]
sw2352A-ms98-a-0124 519.499375 529.317125 "it'd be great but the problem with that is you have" all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing
sw2353A-ms98-a-0037 202.393000 214.732000 uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district "and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class" and these kids
sw2353A-ms98-a-0038 214.732000 225.507625 "um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant" many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors
sw2353A-ms98-a-0077 366.361375 380.691875 and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh "how other people live um" they don't understand
sw2353A-ms98-a-0085 411.692375 420.924625 well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased "the uh funding for the Peace Corps"

sw2353B-ms98-a-0062 332.772000 346.217875 and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not "you're encouraged to do it because" um you know it it helps you and
sw2354A-ms98-a-0076 364.982875 375.469500 "and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore and" i know my my husband's uncle owns a bi[g]- some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas
sw2354B-ms98-a-0004 12.996375 23.263000 that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um "how can i uh" do better at at my small time business uh

sw2354B-ms98-a-0069 528.303625 541.364375 "and we started doing um" large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water
sw2355A-ms98-a-0017 56.393250 61.321625 "and now if" you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate
sw2355A-ms98-a-0028 83.090875 88.649250 so it that's also a good reason why it it "or good that it ended as soon as it did"
sw2355A-ms98-a-0054 186.758875 190.209125 "exactly" be everything be supermom exactly
sw2355A-ms98-a-0068 242.929250 251.265750 "uh detectives now and you know different roles just" in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now
sw2355A-ms98-a-0084 305.116875 310.169500 but there's so many more people exactly that you don't even "and that you don't even see or know about"

sw2358A-ms98-a-0023 87.409125 93.968750 "well we're we're moving to a new house" and so we'll we'll have to get started over there [noise]
sw2359B-ms98-a-0035 191.253250 205.681000 "and the the waitress never once came behind me um um on our side of the table she reached across the table" she never once asked if we wanted coffee we had to grab onto someone else they didn't
sw2359B-ms98-a-0063 336.319375 351.122500 "um because the the the waitresses have no control over the the way the dishes are and" cleaned in the kitchen and if they're not cleaned off well when they go threw the dishwasher food just doesn't always get washed off and it sticks on there and then when they dry them
sw2360A-ms98-a-0039 109.945000 117.608250 well that's right and we never have signed up for those i just haven't been interested in what "they generally have on and"
sw2360A-ms98-a-0119 371.661500 376.192625 i guess "it was probably in the fifties but there's a strong wind"
sw2362A-ms98-a-0053 204.285625 207.223250 "he says my father gave it to me"
sw2362A-ms98-a-0059 221.642500 226.371375 "well i have i i've" fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing
sw2362A-ms98-a-0067 262.079750 269.338625 "yeah because_1 uh that just" that doesn't do a lot for them_1 i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them
sw2362A-ms98-a-0079 315.939625 321.447500 "oh sure i mean i[t's]- i[t's]-" it's indicative across the board that we we've done something wrong
sw2362A-ms98-a-0096 364.960375 373.395500 "and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester"
sw2362A-ms98-a-0101 381.957000 388.138375 "i never did i always tried to understand things not" tried to memorize

sw2362A-ms98-a-0146 530.857875 539.376625 it's an interesting "interesting thing you want to do i how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it"
sw2362B-ms98-a-0026 95.711000 104.111875 "but i had decided long before" i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
sw2362B-ms98-a-0118 427.866750 439.784125 "in the s[tate]- in the" bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that that can be done
sw2362B-ms98-a-0156 575.781000 578.173125 "state school board"
sw2365A-ms98-a-0013 61.812375 64.389500 "but just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it"

sw2365A-ms98-a-0058 342.494875 356.479000 and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the uh mold "everything is white in a new house everything is white"
sw2365A-ms98-a-0073 433.965500 440.908750 we have "we have we have a soccer field" that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house
sw2365A-ms98-a-0079 472.095250 477.866125 we're really on to that that the masking is "you have to do that very very carefully"
sw2365A-ms98-a-0083 487.207375 488.652500 "it's kind of frustrating"
sw2365B-ms98-a-0021 123.754125 125.735625 "was it like a primer"
sw2365B-ms98-a-0101 484.996875 487.380250 "yeah really no kidding"
sw2366A-ms98-a-0013 132.013125 143.339250 experiencing contacting college "and the fact that i found it it" very relaxing for me my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat

sw2368A-ms98-a-0148 575.968875 585.326125 "oh you bet" and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh

sw2436B-ms98-a-0036 163.801125 165.065625 "right"
sw2436B-ms98-a-0088 389.551000 392.769875 "but that takes too much planning"
sw2436B-ms98-a-0116 475.067750 478.561875 "yeah you have to hunt hard for them_1 i guess"
sw2437A-ms98-a-0012 33.859625 35.240875 "yeah"
sw2437A-ms98-a-0027 127.012125 135.778375 "oh yeah you're that's a good point but at TI they" before they had the testing i've forgotten i[t]- s[eems]- seems like it's a year ago September something like that
sw2437A-ms98-a-0069 399.091625 412.018625 so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome "and they're always over in someone else's house so our we've been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and"
sw2437A-ms98-a-0073 450.050875 457.506625 you wait until they go and get a car insurance and you and that's when they get expensive as they get older "you know uh i[t]- i[t]-"
sw2439A-ms98-a-0108 525.996000 530.977125 oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup "and uh"
sw2439B-ms98-a-0028 102.981875 112.965000 well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh "were the new ones" there um-hum well now um
sw2439B-ms98-a-0035 136.137500 147.740375 uh of course we['re]- we're not we can't "consider getting a brand new Cadillac because_1 those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars" but when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half
sw2439B-ms98-a-0048 210.490875 214.501000 "oh i'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars"
sw2439B-ms98-a-0057 246.988875 255.464625 "well what you can do is take your car payment" and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
sw2439B-ms98-a-0077 320.150000 321.783125 "eventually"
sw2439B-ms98-a-0080 342.717500 348.997750 "so that that's kind of been the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever"
sw2440B-ms98-a-0028 120.224500 131.491625 "the seats aren't real soft and comfortable and there's only so many positions you can get in" and your body gets tired plus you hear the roa[d]- road noise a lot
sw2440B-ms98-a-0044 171.481875 175.851500 [laughter-yeah] "[laughter-got] [laughter-to] [laughter-see] [laughter-them] [laughter-all] [laughter-the] [laughter-time]"
sw2440B-ms98-a-0160 588.981500 595.494000 "and it just ruins you too you just makes you sick and then you have insurance you know goes up and"
sw2442A-ms98-a-0080 313.683000 316.221125 "my my wife has been working with them"
sw2442B-ms98-a-0037 129.334000 133.056250 "i guess it depends on the person depends on how [laughter-motivated]" you [laughter-are]
sw2442B-ms98-a-0048 186.897000 197.080500 "so uh" so we when we go we have about do about fifteen miles a week but the last little while for one the reason or another we haven't been [laughter-real] [laughter-consistent] so
sw2442B-ms98-a-0054 211.471125 220.633250 "and i usually do it because_1 i want to" because i know it's good for me not because you know i don't i don't feel obligated to do it and i enjoy it
sw2442B-ms98-a-0059 246.402375 255.839625 "painful but the the TI rec center has an aerobics program for for" um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing
sw2442B-ms98-a-0059 246.402375 255.839625 painful but the the TI rec center has an aerobics program for for um prenatal and postnatal "aerobic type thing"
sw2442B-ms98-a-0075 324.549250 327.741000 "find out if she wanted to go"
sw2444B-ms98-a-0046 323.080000 333.889250 when i was "growing up and i be[fore]- before i was married i was teaching school and teaching down in Corpus Christi and i wanted to be able to at least change a flat tire"
sw2445A-ms98-a-0038 256.938750 267.188000 they go oh that place is great there's no bugs [laughter] "but oh okay" because uh we were having a b[ig]- a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad
sw2445A-ms98-a-0043 300.262500 306.409375 i mean just the very second it's really strange "they uh they must uh"
sw2445A-ms98-a-0057 379.756875 389.482125 i do want to go again "we just moved to a new" hou[se]- into a house so i don't see camping maybe in the backyard but i don't see going on a camping trip probably till next summer
sw2445A-ms98-a-0080 500.416500 502.826125 i "i mean i wouldn't stay in the um"
sw2445A-ms98-a-0089 524.495750 529.749375 yeah huh "wow so they evacuated it [laughter]"
sw2445B-ms98-a-0028 155.503250 166.214750 yeah i don't know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean other "other than you know" taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something
sw2446A-ms98-a-0064 521.788125 526.903125 something that nationalized very quickly "and the same with the coops"
sw2446B-ms98-a-0006 32.608750 41.119250 we visit Mexico occasionally so [laughter] yeah "we we do have a little information on it here but" uh
sw2446B-ms98-a-0014 82.843500 97.703500 the uh Civil War really picked up down there "and US policy at that particular time there was of course military" assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything that's
sw2446B-ms98-a-0015 97.703500 110.633625 that's {anticommunist} you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro [laughter] it don't matter "what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the"
sw2446B-ms98-a-0023 183.951375 197.337750 of course we kind of concentrate on there wasn't much to take out of the country i felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or "bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh" it just
sw2446B-ms98-a-0039 290.260750 298.280000 but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old "brash ugly American type"
sw2446B-ms98-a-0080 536.775875 549.771250 "i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of" a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw2447B-ms98-a-0024 137.314375 149.075500 "yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa" so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back
sw2447B-ms98-a-0039 224.742000 233.806250 oh well [laughter] [laughter-maybe] [laughter-maybe] [laughter-they'll] [laughter-be] [laughter-all] [laughter-right] "i know in mine if i did something like that and then my husband found out jeez he would jus[t]-"
sw2447B-ms98-a-0040 233.806250 240.692625 "be" well i- i think i would feel the same way i'd i'd really feel like i'd been deceived you know that that wasn't the thing to do
sw2448A-ms98-a-0010 47.466500 52.993000 "i don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have"
sw2448A-ms98-a-0027 153.770375 157.749500 and they "don't have a waiting period"
sw2448A-ms98-a-0055 277.828625 282.048500 so "anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against"
sw2448A-ms98-a-0064 316.835000 319.312625 "they're liable to tear up my membership"
sw2448B-ms98-a-0038 120.092125 131.978000 um-hum that's true i i like i say i don't have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it's "just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one"
sw2450A-ms98-a-0015 58.786500 71.302625 yeah i know it's been bothering me a lot but yeah i think "nor[mally]- i think the weather overall has been um" probably like you said probably a little bit warm and [noise] so [noise]
sw2450A-ms98-a-0018 77.994875 89.895875 [noise] i know "i just think it's been warm and it's been hot and" i like it and it's beautiful and all the trees are pretty and i wish it would stay like this all the time [laughter]
sw2451A-ms98-a-0008 73.033000 88.002375 is the result of that i[f]- if they can get the army or the military "to sway to their side i think that uh" it will be on the way out eventually
sw2451A-ms98-a-0047 391.902125 397.581500 "well their knowledge" with uh better communication processes
sw2451A-ms98-a-0065 500.055625 502.694875 "because we've been so used to it"
sw2451A-ms98-a-0073 561.416250 568.024375 "internal strifes are" more important right now than
sw2451A-ms98-a-0074 568.024375 574.715500 "concentrating on any kind of outside affairs" that they used to be
sw2451B-ms98-a-0002 16.551625 23.745125 well they do have uh "a major internal problem" [laughter] everybody wants to defect and i can understand why um
sw2451B-ms98-a-0010 165.062500 176.821000 uh power figure you know competing against him and i think it's gonna be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as uh "realizing"
sw2451B-ms98-a-0044 447.271625 455.973875 "yeah i think they're starting to realize" but i i just don't think they have the resources if you were to compare uh
sw2451B-ms98-a-0044 447.271625 455.973875 yeah i think they're starting to realize but i i just don't think they have the "resources if you were to compare uh"
sw2452B-ms98-a-0027 126.658750 128.679375 "i think it's such a shame that"
sw2453B-ms98-a-0006 38.506125 49.586625 "well i i uh" just in my lifetime i know that the role of women has changed drastically also my mother when she began having her family she quit her job and stayed home until
sw2453B-ms98-a-0032 269.968625 277.983500 "now are at home without their mothers" well or in some type of a day care or something because so many women work now
sw2454A-ms98-a-0031 154.249875 157.012500 "oh really that's interesting"
sw2454A-ms98-a-0057 298.746625 301.018375 "oh my"
sw2454A-ms98-a-0067 361.962625 374.481250 and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers that's the problem with the news both the "on television and" the paper
sw2454A-ms98-a-0068 374.481250 384.255875 well all they're there to sell you know or to entertain even worse "and uh not to transmit information"
sw2454A-ms98-a-0073 403.290625 411.494625 in in a savings and loan [laughter] or "own a or has a brother that owns yeah"
sw2455A-ms98-a-0031 202.653625 211.459500 but uh i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things [laughter] "you know the money was the issue"
sw2455A-ms98-a-0032 211.459500 222.180375 but uh "even now i would i would like to not have to work in some ways" it it's kind of pull and tug on the other hand
sw2455A-ms98-a-0052 332.706500 346.123125 i don't yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children "uh and even those who may not do it seem to be"
sw2455B-ms98-a-0011 58.725000 60.741125 "than before"
sw2455B-ms98-a-0032 162.113000 173.927000 um not people that are you know necessarily good friends even though that has happened too uh it it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence you know w[hen]- "if you decide to go back to work then"
sw2455B-ms98-a-0059 316.930875 330.823875 i- i we[ll]- i hope to see employer based you know helping out "you know child uh" care centers at the place of employment and and things like that that will help out
sw2455B-ms98-a-0072 394.684000 397.411250 "and yet" they
sw2455B-ms98-a-0081 438.934500 441.245750 "to say the least"
sw2457A-ms98-a-0002 8.117250 18.422250 and i was really worried about it raining because it its has been there been some dark clouds "and it's been pretty rainy" looking
sw2457A-ms98-a-0058 284.976125 286.876375 "that's right"
sw2457A-ms98-a-0083 388.790750 394.017000 an[d]- "get some fresh air in the house and" it feels good but
sw2459B-ms98-a-0026 202.047875 208.846125 "if these people uh are on drugs uh it doesn't the test results uh the results which they are"
sw2459B-ms98-a-0033 230.892500 232.338625 "that's right"
sw2459B-ms98-a-0054 404.556500 415.348375 uh would come about just as small pox vaccinations were for years "and some of the other types of vaccinations for syphilis and uh gonorrhea" what have you
sw2460A-ms98-a-0044 285.045000 294.604500 "uh take that as a challenge which is the way most teams" nat[urally]- you know naturally do uh and and just go out and and not give anybody a chance to beat them_1 so
sw2460A-ms98-a-0066 399.392750 405.075500 "that have the talent to do the best years and" um that they hadn't had these
sw2460A-ms98-a-0078 458.484875 472.282625 um that's probably true well considering what i've seen in the last uh you know two seasons i'm beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you don't have to spend the big money as far as i'm concerned "to uh"
sw2460A-ms98-a-0079 472.282625 486.228250 to win you just have to spend it if it's necessary in other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team then keep him there don't let him go away you know "and i think that's really what's been hurting uh uh the uh Rangers"
sw2460A-ms98-a-0081 488.023625 499.613375 "oh yeah they they spent more money last" year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league uh so it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you uh winning a pennant
sw2460B-ms98-a-0008 45.723875 60.021625 well there's there's a guy on that was on Norm Hisken's show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a st[atistic]- "it's a statistic that has to do with" winning
sw2460B-ms98-a-0010 63.243500 69.454250 and apparently the Rangers last year won a lot "of one run games"
sw2460B-ms98-a-0016 100.518250 105.874125 "which means that if you have a good year winning one ru[n]-" one run games that the following year
sw2460B-ms98-a-0066 485.388000 490.740750 "well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their" pitching staff
sw2465A-ms98-a-0080 340.561125 348.960750 oh okay yeah golly i've got "up up at work anyway i use uh WordPerfect and Lotus and"
sw2465A-ms98-a-0121 525.555625 528.544375 "yeah we sort of stayed to the topic anyway"
sw2465B-ms98-a-0032 120.060000 126.130000 "man there's so they're" i learned so many things that they they do they're into so many different things so
sw2465B-ms98-a-0094 367.332125 369.833750 "survey system and" and um
sw2466A-ms98-a-0019 81.890250 91.079375 good self help "well" um probably the best one that i i know of and i work with all the time is called Search for Significance
sw2466A-ms98-a-0097 557.554750 562.611125 "well i guess we've" covered the topic pretty thoroughly
sw2466B-ms98-a-0050 225.881125 238.014000 and it wa[s]- it was good um she she's not didn't enjoy it much so i didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her "but uh i thought it was real interesting"
sw2466B-ms98-a-0067 363.088000 372.904000 "the author of Jonathan Jonathan Livingston Sea[gull]-" Seagull i can't think of his name right now pardon me
sw2466B-ms98-a-0071 383.588375 396.008375 "A Bridge to Forever" those are r[eally]- really mind expanding [laughter-books] his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of

sw2466B-ms98-a-0073 398.288000 401.763000 i "can't think of what his name is right right off the bat though"
sw2466B-ms98-a-0075 403.320250 408.021000 "but uh th[ey]- th[ey]- they were fun they were real"

sw2467A-ms98-a-0034 184.783125 192.994375 we have the things that "are extras" but it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist
sw2467A-ms98-a-0080 368.147750 372.713875 "well i'm i'm a west Texan" Lubbock Midland Odessa

sw2467A-ms98-a-0128 561.647125 568.430875 "did" well i've been with the company sixteen years now i was a WF for several years
sw2467B-ms98-a-0014 80.165125 91.425000 "so so was uh you know two miles a day" [laughter] to and from work [laughter] so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now i've just bought a new house and i'm a half hour
sw2467B-ms98-a-0018 118.521625 128.840500 uh i have three children "and uh it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things" that they seem to need
sw2467B-ms98-a-0092 407.954750 414.870125 yeah yeah they have a state income tax in Maryland but i noticed when i was in the "in the"
sw2467B-ms98-a-0119 547.351250 554.342000 yeah i know what you mean i uh when i was in Dallas i was supervisor and i had uh "four non exempts"
sw2469A-ms98-a-0009 50.726625 53.926375 "that's true i do the same [laughter-thing]"
sw2469A-ms98-a-0072 338.437625 352.765500 no i never have tried that just because i don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment "um or this little balcony" and my my other two pots are they're kind of they're pretty big and and i have enough plants in them_1 that um
sw2469B-ms98-a-0015 56.935250 71.572625 um i do some little bit of woodworking well i used to i i don't have the equipment here we moved to Dallas about a year ago "and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment" and i did some of that um here i've mostly done things that i can do strictly by hand um sewing
sw2469B-ms98-a-0042 197.607500 207.745500 something similar to that but it doesn't have the specific stitches anyway it's a little bit more loose and not uh quite as structured and i like that a little bit better "the variety of stitches and stuff in that"
sw2469B-ms98-a-0043 207.745500 210.170625 "more like embroidery or something"
sw2469B-ms98-a-0118 527.934125 529.970125 "reached our time limit"
sw2470A-ms98-a-0010 165.509500 175.042000 "uh differences uh the machine tends to react as fast as i can i use an eight[y]-" as a matter of fact use an eighty eighty eight at at home uh which is really old iron

sw2470A-ms98-a-0014 205.227250 217.595750 a buttons PC file program that uh is a very simplistic relational data base for labels and things "so i guess i would have to say on a home setting i'm probably on"
sw2470A-ms98-a-0020 253.472125 266.588250 uh APA printers and so i get frustrated uh watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer "more so than i do over over access speed" um
sw2470A-ms98-a-0027 299.200875 306.317375 uh no i have access to uh spell correction "uh material i" s[eldom]-
sw2470A-ms98-a-0029 319.454250 328.457250 uh i i execute on a three eighty six machine that is attached to the mainframe as a s[erver]- "as a intelligent work station" but i use it
sw2471A-ms98-a-0012 103.770125 114.304375 a[s]- as we did and as we sold arms to [noise] "pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran" and then uh and then it turned around and
sw2471A-ms98-a-0023 209.987250 222.354750 well that's right because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have uh "have to have that for" farming [laughter] and they don't look at it so much as you know
sw2471A-ms98-a-0033 263.899375 274.477375 "yes it's really kind of sad and" that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and
sw2471B-ms98-a-0035 251.685625 264.223875 "right yeah we're just so much wealthier and uh" and uh there has to be resentment built up and that's where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises
sw2472A-ms98-a-0012 22.768500 27.514125 [laughter] "i expect so" uh
sw2472A-ms98-a-0044 147.006750 153.783875 some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi[th]- "and some cool whip"
sw2472A-ms98-a-0045 153.783875 162.202000 and i make a thickened blueberry sauce and i layer it with uh "angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping"
sw2472A-ms98-a-0062 223.023375 228.457125 oh and pour that over it "that sounds great" it'd be pretty
sw2472A-ms98-a-0100 352.208250 354.824750 "they'll eat fish" she'll eat fish
sw2472B-ms98-a-0019 83.587500 85.619500 i[t's]- "it's a red wine"
sw2472B-ms98-a-0048 198.869625 210.101875 and then you you bake that and then you um take things like Kiwi "and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want"
sw2472B-ms98-a-0066 272.387000 283.296250 no and that's some[thing]- that's something that just you know it it doesn't take a long time to fix and it's really good and it's really good for you "and we eat out a lot"
sw2472B-ms98-a-0117 502.486125 516.123875 yeah but usually if i'm if i'm if i take a day off or on the weekend especially "i try to cook" real real food and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead so that we can
sw2474B-ms98-a-0003 14.070000 19.973875 "dry out there we didn't have a whole lot we just had a little bit lot of dew this morning"
sw2474B-ms98-a-0054 286.271625 294.553375 and then they um "you know then they let you know you write in and they let you know later on what the r[esults]- general results were throughout the United States"
sw2474B-ms98-a-0059 322.049125 333.882000 "it spans about forty feet on one side of of our fence but we have the perfect yard for it because the sun comes up in the morning and strikes the back yard all morning until you know about"
sw2474B-ms98-a-0073 390.201625 404.057375 and then it bakes [laughter-during] the summer and the backyard is great because we get all the southerly winds back there and so they're not blowing as hard "and uh then we get the eastern sun so the backyard's great for growing stuff"
sw2474B-ms98-a-0097 504.355375 514.963000 and uh they are susceptible to rotting and so when there's too much water "they die" and that's that's what really kills them is the too much water
sw2477A-ms98-a-0069 265.134625 269.489125 "-[De]troit's in that same" uh that that same uh division
sw2477B-ms98-a-0060 224.002625 226.174250 "and uh they've got Perkins"
sw2477B-ms98-a-0126 428.427875 433.931625 "yeah yeah" i don't i don't think there's any clear pick that you know
sw2478A-ms98-a-0096 442.144750 451.925500 uh being basically an engineer and liking uh "doing installation work well there's not any i mean there literally is no installation work going on"
sw2478B-ms98-a-0068 285.944375 289.336500 we could spend our way "rich"
sw2478B-ms98-a-0127 521.382750 523.332500 "uh one of our"
sw2479A-ms98-a-0071 299.145625 310.745250 "right she" goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by the s[tate]- uh uh i don't know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they
sw2479A-ms98-a-0071 299.145625 310.745250 right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home "visitations by this" s[tate]- uh uh i don't know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they
sw2479B-ms98-a-0009 18.121000 29.084250 yeah i do i do i work and and uh Brian's in a day care center he's uh he was two in December so he's not quite two and a half yet "he uh i put him i'm"
sw2479B-ms98-a-0012 38.571250 48.841625 and i just i don't know i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people i have had this real "problem with a" a private individual i mean i i kind of looked at it like
sw2479B-ms98-a-0028 162.963000 164.880125 "yeah i bet" [laughter]
sw2479B-ms98-a-0075 395.694500 400.190875 uh-huh "even at that age they need that time" we all need that time
sw2479B-ms98-a-0097 555.131000 565.143125 so "it's a little high but" but it's you know it's like where he was before i was only paying sixty three so there's quite a little jump there but i looked all over Louisville
sw2480A-ms98-a-0028 123.174250 125.955500 "no i haven't"
sw2480A-ms98-a-0058 225.449625 227.849625 "no you can't it's uh"
sw2481A-ms98-a-0069 269.424375 271.824500 a capital's capital "punishment"
sw2482A-ms98-a-0127 301.670750 303.921875 "so is that quality time"
sw2482A-ms98-a-0132 312.429875 314.718000 "somewhat yeah yeah"
sw2482A-ms98-a-0147 351.095625 352.939375 "well yeah and"
sw2482A-ms98-a-0189 476.967500 481.621875 uh but "Jenny is a sweet kid"
sw2482A-ms98-a-0204 526.813625 530.057875 it's "i don't see how anyone can afford it"
sw2482A-ms98-a-0206 532.899250 534.040250 "and"
sw2482A-ms98-a-0223 570.206000 581.489125 well our problem is that you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or "uh Disney Land or" God forbid Disney World would take forever
sw2482B-ms98-a-0006 9.787750 12.606375 "no it's not do you have children"
sw2482B-ms98-a-0008 13.974500 14.862000 "one"
sw2482B-ms98-a-0030 76.711125 78.332375 "i guess"
sw2482B-ms98-a-0115 310.625875 313.305000 "uh-huh she likes to do that"
sw2482B-ms98-a-0132 363.901375 365.087000 [noise] "yeah"
sw2483A-ms98-a-0007 50.152375 61.342750 and then newspapers and TV would be tied after that because uh maybe i'll catch the the "the evening news like ten o'clock on TV and i" [vocalized-noise] so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
sw2483A-ms98-a-0064 445.966750 457.059125 but it's still good it's still uh uh you know it's you don't really miss anything but i d[o]- i do enjoy uh since the the Gulf War "uh listen to CNN radio too"
sw2483B-ms98-a-0036 300.800000 308.717375 "sometimes the noise and observer" uh it depends it it's it has decent national coverage but has an extremely
sw2483B-ms98-a-0065 510.308250 520.263000 uh and because of that we began towards the middle o[f]- end of the war i guess about two and a half three weeks in "we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would"
sw2484B-ms98-a-0033 119.678750 131.781000 um to the first "to to kidnapping and" so we went through the second part of the trial because_1 in Texas there are two parts first of all to find if they are guilty or innocent
sw2484B-ms98-a-0064 334.214625 344.187375 "so and in in this case everyone on the jury felt that it should have been" [laughter] and they were very convinced the man had no redeeming
sw2484B-ms98-a-0072 368.132125 377.342750 "i don't work with perfect people anymore than anybody else does but i can handle" the imperfections that i'm around i- i could not work in the in
sw2484B-ms98-a-0091 445.732125 447.357500 "oh okay"
sw2485A-ms98-a-0016 46.907875 49.620375 "oh great"
sw2486A-ms98-a-0028 193.083875 204.203250 "in my class and uh" when i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad
sw2486A-ms98-a-0076 482.549500 484.004750 "yeah"
sw2486A-ms98-a-0078 486.640750 494.926000 yeah well i don't either unfortunately i don't have to work in those companies [laughter] "but uh i- i uh"
sw2487B-ms98-a-0042 160.185000 163.978750 "well i would definitely have to look at price"
sw2487B-ms98-a-0073 315.215500 326.826500 oh the[y]- well they they make you they don't make you feel at ease but i've come to the point where "i know that i'm the one they charge and that they can't you know"
sw2487B-ms98-a-0074 326.826500 332.576250 "talk me into" some[thing]- um i think they're intimidating to both men and women
sw2487B-ms98-a-0098 441.377375 443.828750 "do you think of colors at all when you"
sw2487B-ms98-a-0125 521.644500 524.700375 powerful en[ough]- "right right"
sw2488A-ms98-a-0009 28.475750 30.933000 [laughter] "very much so" [laughter]
sw2488B-ms98-a-0016 35.192750 37.746500 "yeah oh i do too i do too"
sw2490A-ms98-a-0022 74.216750 81.568500 right and see that's my only problem with uh "making you" um
sw2490A-ms98-a-0140 510.121375 521.886375 true true well we have dogs "that are pretty" very protective [laughter-so] if they're if they're s[tupid]- yeah if they're stupid enough to come through then [laughter]
sw2490A-ms98-a-0148 543.873000 549.238000 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-yeah] really does "well do you think we've"
sw2490B-ms98-a-0016 103.150750 114.440000 you know i i that's that's the kind of people i like i say i don't think the guy who's going to rob a 7-Eleven is going to rob a 7-Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball "bat or you know whatever"
sw2490B-ms98-a-0051 294.088000 301.197375 "need to teach their kids" what not to what to do and what not to do because_1 i started shooting my dad
sw2492A-ms98-a-0026 101.695625 105.723125 "what else did it k[ill]-" did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to
sw2492A-ms98-a-0049 207.977500 221.366625 and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them_1 in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas "and it was uh quite a drag" because um we got them_1 in our house and
sw2493B-ms98-a-0058 310.198125 321.475125 and so they get her off and at the very end of the case after it's over he's talking with her and he figures out that she really did do it after all a "uh after he got after he got her off"
sw2493B-ms98-a-0059 321.475125 332.684625 well that's how the show that's how the show ended "it just left you hanging there like" you know like you set me up you fed me all this in[formation]- information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and
sw2493B-ms98-a-0059 321.475125 332.684625 well that's how the show that's how the show ended it just left you hanging there like you know like you set me up you fed me all "this in[formation]- information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and"
sw2493B-ms98-a-0087 457.999750 462.499625 "tape it or something on the record mode or on the" ti[me]- yeah
sw2494A-ms98-a-0090 308.739625 311.306250 "yeah i don't know either it's kind of a tough question"
sw2495A-ms98-a-0017 103.035875 107.857000 because it looked so formidable "um then then just"
sw2495A-ms98-a-0048 288.613625 292.278250 "i think my husband's really glad about that [laughter]"
sw2495A-ms98-a-0067 369.497125 371.448375 "oh it does"
sw2496B-ms98-a-0069 290.929250 303.816000 "no no" i i can maybe eat some jalapenos but i really don't you know ask for those on there i'm more like into the enchiladas and and stuff like that but no i don't really like it hot
sw2498A-ms98-a-0025 138.755250 149.706250 restoration to his home i think that was called back "because of all the flack they received but" but that's the another one of the big examples of
sw2498A-ms98-a-0048 236.462125 245.493375 it's it's it's an enormou[s]- [noise] "enormous bureaucracy though it's going to take probably" years to really get that in to order too
sw2499A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.495250 "and all right what have you seen"
sw2499A-ms98-a-0010 40.843125 48.369875 yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh "Dances" uh Silence of the Lambs
sw2499A-ms98-a-0022 105.791875 108.887875 "and there's rats in the attic you know"
sw2499A-ms98-a-0038 159.489375 172.479625 yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean "the the book was so much uh" there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you c[ould]- say what is this
sw2499A-ms98-a-0043 192.714000 195.512375 "oh you're right i haven't" [laughter]
sw2499A-ms98-a-0061 275.965250 281.659000 it was so good "that i had forgotten" that it was Christmas Eve i mean that's something for a kid
sw2499A-ms98-a-0088 409.988750 412.457875 "it was it was filmed in Ireland"
sw2499A-ms98-a-0090 416.774250 422.939000 "and i i've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was"
sw2499B-ms98-a-0002 5.669375 8.239000 "oh man"
sw2499B-ms98-a-0008 34.725125 41.755875 "that was quite a" the buffalo scene in that thing was so real it's like [laughter] i mean it just blew me away
sw2501A-ms98-a-0012 42.932000 47.279500 right are you talking about outside or inside "exterior yeah"
sw2501A-ms98-a-0019 71.642250 80.196000 [noise] but i[t]- it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it "so preparing it is a real problem" you've got to prepare it well or else it'll flake
sw2502A-ms98-a-0005 27.238375 29.843375 "do you think" we should direct the government
sw2502B-ms98-a-0049 296.913625 307.102875 i thought it was the other way around they were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it it's been "sort of like you know"
sw2502B-ms98-a-0064 369.405000 370.719000 "yeah"
sw2502B-ms98-a-0076 457.305625 460.268375 uh "racial i think"

sw2511A-ms98-a-0008 60.818500 71.261000 and so he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard [laughter] "for like fifty dollars which he did" and then
sw2511B-ms98-a-0054 467.706750 479.989000 he didn't know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing i mean he couldn't even check the oil i mean that's that's how "uninformed he was and disinterested"
sw2513A-ms98-a-0032 245.859125 253.990875 but the last problem i had with my vehicle was a [noise] uh fuel pump "that needed replacing"
sw2513A-ms98-a-0058 346.009750 353.611125 "other than that that's the major problems i've had i used to change my own oil and filter but i got tired of that so i let somebody else do it" [laughter]

sw2515A-ms98-a-0065 400.357625 409.301750 but the way we set up you know "the amount that" we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know
sw2515A-ms98-a-0066 409.301750 417.037750 uh "utilities and" uh the house payment and all that those are things you don't really have much control over
sw2515A-ms98-a-0074 461.120625 473.557625 "so we" got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
sw2515A-ms98-a-0088 549.831875 551.578625 "oh yeah"
sw2515B-ms98-a-0034 197.834375 200.072625 "oh okay"

sw2518A-ms98-a-0042 272.466625 282.278000 "no uh in fact that's" kind of uh one of the things that's uh funny about it is i go at eight o'clock at night
sw2518A-ms98-a-0076 487.494500 498.572375 uh to me at least i don't like to go out by myself but that's when we do the most talking and "you know" about things that have taken place during the day and
sw2519A-ms98-a-0070 294.533375 295.876500 "yeah"
sw2520A-ms98-a-0018 70.743125 76.718250 [noise] "i i've been collecting recipes and modifying recipes for a long long time"

sw2522B-ms98-a-0083 300.015875 310.659250 uh and "that means every Congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobody's working on less money going to his area or on anybody else's area"
sw2523A-ms98-a-0022 134.712625 145.325500 the problem was that that she is a real hard worker and has started a a couple of businesses "and now she's started a Korean health food store and"
sw2523A-ms98-a-0084 515.629375 517.470750 "yes"
sw2524A-ms98-a-0035 174.084625 177.006000 "do you like reading as a hobby"

sw2525B-ms98-a-0012 66.203625 78.936125 and uh it didn't seem like it was "that congested in that that part you know because_1 to me where we live out here in the north east it it's" there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
sw2525B-ms98-a-0015 85.490375 96.915250 [noise] "and w[ith]- with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries" not knowing the language and uh they['re]- they're going to the big cities it makes it very difficult

sw2526A-ms98-a-0023 88.994250 91.996125 no "not at all" [laughter]
sw2526A-ms98-a-0057 301.995250 308.697375 "are you still there" this is something's wrong i don't know it sounds funny though doesn't it
sw2526A-ms98-a-0085 420.777625 429.489875 "oh yeah definitely if" it's a limited edition usually no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on

sw2527A-ms98-a-0034 147.047625 160.326000 "uh well it's it's uh" in terms of north south i would say it's uh a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it
sw2527A-ms98-a-0058 260.025625 266.543875 "a lot of people don't realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and"

sw2528A-ms98-a-0087 303.252250 316.745250 a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the uh she was in the junior Olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very very big sports backgrounds to have they lea[ned]- "leaned away from that sort of"
sw2528A-ms98-a-0108 393.344625 394.740500 "they look like"
sw2528A-ms98-a-0133 460.348625 461.857125 "yes"

sw2531B-ms98-a-0022 118.015375 124.388875 "as far as hard line laws dealing with criminals we don't have them in this country anymore we have situation ethics"

sw2534A-ms98-a-0007 18.479750 31.952125 "i keep trying" uh you know you just can't can't give up on it uh i uh i bought some uh plants from Michigan Bulb Company [laughter] they send them to you all ready alive
sw2534A-ms98-a-0039 159.869875 165.966125 so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them "especially the catnip"
sw2534A-ms98-a-0056 223.658875 231.697250 yeah an and if somebody "raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway"
sw2534A-ms98-a-0064 271.971125 277.766250 hobbies "that's about it i don't have much time for hobbies so uh"
sw2534A-ms98-a-0066 283.594875 287.881250 yeah and "raising cats"
sw2534A-ms98-a-0098 475.352250 483.474500 they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually "two colored" uh but this one is uh
sw2534A-ms98-a-0098 475.352250 483.474500 they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually two colored uh but this one "is uh"
sw2534A-ms98-a-0099 483.474500 495.892625 is she's pre[dominantly]- predominantly uh black "but she has chocolate uh paws" chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
sw2534B-ms98-a-0041 166.204625 171.135625 how many cats do you have oh "okay"
sw2534B-ms98-a-0064 282.858000 284.933750 "right that keeps you busy"
sw2537A-ms98-a-0032 255.911875 269.518250 "i think so too uh i know the the group i was in at the time this all came up" they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail boy they just really
sw2537A-ms98-a-0048 435.790375 450.258000 well yes that yes i- i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was [laughter-positive] [laughter-and] i knew it wasn't "you know that just really rub me the wrong way"
sw2537B-ms98-a-0002 5.403125 12.618750 "um personally" i don't have a problem with it uh i think uh
sw2537B-ms98-a-0048 387.761500 398.716500 i really don't think so yeah "i really don't because" some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent
sw2537B-ms98-a-0057 448.923875 459.576000 um-hum absolutely and that i- i don't know if uh "i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too" e[ven]- even if you
sw2537B-ms98-a-0067 505.746125 520.249750 who are in pharmacy school and they could legally "um provide" medicine to their family mens fa[mily]- family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now i- i- i believe
sw2539B-ms98-a-0008 27.341000 31.988750 we would go "to a movie on Thursdays and um"
sw2540A-ms98-a-0009 47.350000 49.415750 "and that didn't help at all"
sw2540A-ms98-a-0047 211.486250 219.500125 uh "though there's you know probably i'm sure some" sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns
sw2540A-ms98-a-0053 258.814000 268.278250 but i- i think definitely like today they just introduced the what's called the Brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period "on getting any guns and i think that"
sw2540B-ms98-a-0045 298.727125 308.460875 you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways and then you come here in in the Dallas area "um"
sw2543A-ms98-a-0004 25.310000 34.755250 too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the "the news or something" but um so i tend to listen to some of the older
sw2543A-ms98-a-0053 294.401250 309.029875 "you could record it" you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of so CDs won't be nearly as handy
sw2543A-ms98-a-0072 421.090250 427.256250 um-hum and so i really think we've tried to "tone down"
sw2543B-ms98-a-0069 332.430250 347.109875 you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them_1 probably will have "CDs players by then" but uh i'm not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off [laughter-so] i'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until
sw2543B-ms98-a-0070 347.109875 361.403125 until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a CD player that she got for Christmas and she's got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto CDs "i mean i'm sorry" other way around off CDs onto cassettes um
sw2545A-ms98-a-0026 154.884625 165.998000 yeah but you have to have a need i really have no need for it at all um "i work for Digital Equipment" and we have a powerful computer down at work
sw2545A-ms98-a-0046 262.916375 265.893000 "but i'm doing all right getting over it"
sw2545A-ms98-a-0056 325.528875 330.381375 you do run in[to]- "you do run into limitations on yours" oh wow
sw2545B-ms98-a-0006 19.091500 29.674625 um you know the bane of our existence these days uh but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for re[ports]- "reports and papers and that sort of thing"
sw2545B-ms98-a-0024 99.094625 101.170000 "yeah don't blame her"
sw2545B-ms98-a-0070 271.524750 274.449750 [noise] "well they vary tremendously"
sw2545B-ms98-a-0079 328.451625 337.042875 oh yeah uh-huh some things we can't do "but but then we haven't needed to either" you know um but we've been able to do what we can
sw2546A-ms98-a-0012 94.123750 98.818250 but i lean towards "if it's premeditated or if it's uh"
sw2546A-ms98-a-0016 145.262875 158.408125 yeah i think that's what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up "back on the streets after five years or" six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months
sw2546B-ms98-a-0005 48.794250 60.425875 uh you know it "it really irks me to see" so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they
sw2546B-ms98-a-0030 246.250750 256.668125 yeah it it's amazing there's uh "there's a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact her her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in Sherman"
sw2546B-ms98-a-0032 265.772125 276.439750 and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just cold-blooded murder him and three other people "and but still"
sw2547A-ms98-a-0004 6.564625 8.902125 "oh is that right" [laughter]
sw2547A-ms98-a-0013 52.643000 54.496125 "oh that's neat"
sw2547A-ms98-a-0034 169.533625 175.508500 "the area itself uh the Fort Worth Dallas area" um has
sw2547A-ms98-a-0059 302.216625 312.097625 uh "we have no basement" [laughter] i don't know if Pensacop[la]- okay [laughter] i wasn't sure most of the ones you know know up north and everything do [laughter] but [laughter] um anyway
sw2547A-ms98-a-0059 302.216625 312.097625 uh we have no basement [laughter] i don't know if Pensacop[la]- okay [laughter] i wasn't sure most of the ones you know know up north and everything do [laughter] but [laughter] "um anyway"
sw2547A-ms98-a-0063 339.117000 348.119125 "there was it" like most areas that are built um there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from [laughter]
sw2547A-ms98-a-0096 532.668875 535.819875 that much of a difference uh "wow"
sw2547A-ms98-a-0101 543.142125 547.375125 "wow" why is that do you know i mean
sw2547B-ms98-a-0064 238.891500 240.592250 "the case"
sw2547B-ms98-a-0072 272.680000 277.660625 [noise] reasonable construction "would probably run you uh"
sw2547B-ms98-a-0099 385.050375 392.964125 "no we are west" Sevren is East near the Eastern Shore if i had
sw2547B-ms98-a-0099 385.050375 392.964125 no we are west Sevren is "East near the Eastern Shore" if i had
sw2547B-ms98-a-0112 451.903250 455.615625 "for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment"
sw2547B-ms98-a-0118 477.079000 485.411750 uh for the and so you on that "it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on an on a"
sw2547B-ms98-a-0127 526.306875 529.208500 "but the taxes would be you know"
sw2548A-ms98-a-0031 105.845750 115.643500 "well i never" w[ell]- well i kind of know how to drive standard but i've never owned one so i had[n't]- i don't drive one a lot so i don't f[eel]- feel comfortable in traffic with it
sw2548A-ms98-a-0062 197.194000 198.491250 "oh"
sw2548B-ms98-a-0037 118.853500 120.611000 "yeah it is"
sw2548B-ms98-a-0056 193.727625 201.382375 "but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through" so that's how i ended up with a Honda
sw2549A-ms98-a-0022 87.714375 101.848375 and uh uh i guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys "um because_1 uh you know this is a big football territory down here" and uh uh
sw2549A-ms98-a-0026 133.866250 147.067250 a philosophy for oh i don't know probably the last you know twenty five years except for the last about five or six years "uh they always went out and tried to draft the the best um athletes"
sw2549A-ms98-a-0050 311.766000 314.319125 yeah "yeah really"
sw2549B-ms98-a-0022 78.458500 79.900500 "oh okay"
sw2549B-ms98-a-0065 330.579250 335.653625 "um no i- i- i live near Baltimore and um"
sw2549B-ms98-a-0102 568.981875 576.675250 "and um i was not real happy when uh when they" uh left to go go there of all places [laughter]
sw2549B-ms98-a-0104 579.991875 584.220375 no i- i um "i transferred to Delaware and graduated there"
sw2549B-ms98-a-0108 588.550250 592.177875 "yeah but it's close to Philadelphia and Baltimore" so it's
sw2550A-ms98-a-0094 361.246750 373.233125 i think i think Michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh Grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while "kind of an older guy sh[e]-"
sw2550A-ms98-a-0100 387.695500 394.595875 "an[d]- and anyway Le[land]-" Leland apparently has hired him on now and [laughter-he's] and he's defending this case
sw2551B-ms98-a-0064 569.041750 583.801125 it "there's a way to recycle everything and" and um if your husband just retired then i've got to believe that you've got to be old enough to remember that back during the wars hey recycling was the thing to do i mean you didn't
sw2552A-ms98-a-0009 55.498750 69.941375 so there's one or two nights a week we have a on Monday nights we set aside time where "it's called uh family home evening and" we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together
sw2552A-ms98-a-0017 81.365250 89.370625 so you do that and right and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday "usually in the morning"
sw2552A-ms98-a-0110 551.718125 553.309625 "well that's good"
sw2552B-ms98-a-0034 131.746625 139.128375 "yes w[e]-" we've my uh well when we first got married my wife worked for a year
sw2552B-ms98-a-0101 453.282125 460.984375 "my uh youngest sister's at BYU now and so they have no one at home" she's back teaching school full time now again
sw2552B-ms98-a-0112 491.263000 501.685500 and and the one person i know that has one they they feel guilty she has this continual guilt trip that she's not "doing the right thing and so"
sw2553B-ms98-a-0095 431.165500 434.586625 "uh-huh okay i guess i don't"
sw2553B-ms98-a-0105 464.369625 466.137375 "i see"
sw2556B-ms98-a-0058 250.939250 257.199750 "i have uh bushes and stuff that really need trimming and um so" uh
sw2557A-ms98-a-0088 400.168000 407.300000 oh well Knox is just over the hill here [laughter] "yes uh-huh they" they no longer are you know
sw2557B-ms98-a-0058 262.538500 274.758500 so there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they don't want but then any kind of computer paper letters uh "booklets they'll even take things that are bound"
sw2557B-ms98-a-0062 305.027250 313.266625 real concerned about how they take care of that sort of thing i- i don't know all the details but "they're really on top of that"
sw2557B-ms98-a-0067 353.156250 367.388125 very inconvenient and um it's just you know hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things if they would make it "something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least"
sw2557B-ms98-a-0078 414.254750 421.666500 and used to travel up there to Knox quite a "bit and and i even did once when i was a child" you know so

sw2571A-ms98-a-0012 73.494000 83.220000 and genuinely change it but that doesn't negate "that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person" and it is
sw2571A-ms98-a-0081 536.263875 547.400875 i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include "you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with"
sw2571B-ms98-a-0019 153.621000 167.351875 yes but my concern is first of "all that not all" all persons who i think should be receiving capital
sw2571B-ms98-a-0020 167.351875 175.168500 uh "whatever capital" uh tha[t]- uh th[at]-

sw2573A-ms98-a-0072 479.869000 488.357875 "but and i you know what i mean i- they" were right next to us and it was obvious that they didn't know and so and he ate it all before they got back and everything and so
sw2573A-ms98-a-0081 536.395250 538.518375 "government and everything then"
sw2574B-ms98-a-0037 160.865250 164.044875 "they're kind of in between right now they're they're not"
sw2574B-ms98-a-0038 164.044875 175.619875 "uh they're not getting the benefits of being a democratic place" but they they know what they are and uh the country tells them that you know this is what it's like to be a democracy and they're still hurting
sw2574B-ms98-a-0066 279.805375 288.252750 i wouldn't trust them either you know i wouldn't trust them to se[nd]- "to send a story about the United States" to their people correctly
sw2574B-ms98-a-0082 345.860500 357.617750 and you know like giving them pla[ns]- "plans for the some of the uh" top secret aircraft that we have and things like that i mean that's ridiculous that is only asking for trouble
sw2575A-ms98-a-0024 123.669375 133.662500 uh it's i think it would be good for them uh it helps mature them a little bit and "helps them understand the world the way it really is"
sw2575A-ms98-a-0039 217.275000 225.552500 "and and most of them aren't" i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right ou[t]- i mean even in high school
sw2575A-ms98-a-0040 225.552500 230.785500 and you know y[ou]- "you wonder" where are the parents in all of this
sw2575A-ms98-a-0057 293.898875 303.543125 "well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country" and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh
sw2575A-ms98-a-0082 448.203000 461.038625 and y[ou]- the government's going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they're going to get it from us "and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government" we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program
sw2575A-ms98-a-0088 500.750375 513.048625 um "course on the other hand i can" start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't
sw2575B-ms98-a-0038 285.628125 294.644625 "and what it takes to have that good life" a[nd]- if you're willing to work for it then they're probably be more inclined to work for it
sw2578A-ms98-a-0050 263.751000 269.720375 "well i like the classics too" uh i think that there's a lot of
sw2578A-ms98-a-0065 352.292375 357.570125 and i do enjoy those quite a bit "and um so i tend to"
sw2578A-ms98-a-0099 510.891875 517.906875 to read books and "and" [noise] because even if it's like you say it's light reading you are still getting some
sw2578B-ms98-a-0025 182.171750 184.181250 "that uh"
sw2578B-ms98-a-0077 568.093000 574.888625 oh it sounds like your kids are [laughter-doing] [laughter-stuff] "so are are you a teacher" i gathered you might be a teacher
sw2579A-ms98-a-0046 185.255625 193.675875 "yeah oh boy the the that" whew that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather
sw2579A-ms98-a-0108 496.097000 498.479500 "oh that must be nice"
sw2579B-ms98-a-0023 81.514750 82.921375 "what's that"
sw2579B-ms98-a-0097 453.594625 460.038625 "uh okay" okay that makes sense then [laughter] i believe
sw2579B-ms98-a-0120 570.050750 576.387375 "now that i'm alone why uh" i uh prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere
sw2580B-ms98-a-0026 103.449375 111.465250 i can agree in "local elect[ions]- elections which usually are on Saturdays and i'm not too sure that's the best idea i think maybe you should have it"
sw2580B-ms98-a-0027 111.465250 117.591875 "you know Friday noon till Saturday so that people who i like do things during the week"

sw2580B-ms98-a-0083 410.378500 417.197750 "you know this thing in Saudi Arabia and all and they still don't allow women to vote it is still amazing" of course we we don't have such a wonderful history that

sw2586A-ms98-a-0026 135.883750 139.065250 "coils of line into your hand"
sw2586A-ms98-a-0033 154.801625 158.130000 "right and then you let it carry it downstream"
sw2586A-ms98-a-0049 219.761250 222.875750 "they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall"

sw2597B-ms98-a-0066 373.617875 386.681750 they yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals and right what they were going to say "and the American people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that" so they were they were playing it very safe but

sw2622A-ms98-a-0056 263.991250 266.196750 "in the taxing system"

sw2622B-ms98-a-0018 65.886250 75.615875 if if it were to spent in the right way i think wouldn't be so upset about it but "given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem"
sw2623A-ms98-a-0067 237.705875 244.471500 "so that sounds great" well uh we also have five children
sw2623A-ms98-a-0071 273.710875 280.699000 uh and those activities helped a lot in "giving us things to do with the children"

sw2623A-ms98-a-0127 504.989625 506.232250 "uh-huh"
sw2623B-ms98-a-0009 31.241000 45.739500 um "and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh full-time job that" was more than a full-time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday
sw2623B-ms98-a-0010 45.739500 53.487125 and uh so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i "really wanted to"

sw2624A-ms98-a-0081 553.423000 556.738250 "and i'm somewhat cynical"

sw2636A-ms98-a-0029 141.254875 149.293250 my wife was reading in Consumer Reports i think the week later "about" the car seats and apparently that's a pretty st[andard]- standard practice
sw2637B-ms98-a-0015 120.374250 124.496750 "yeah or a barbecue or something like that yeah"
sw2638A-ms98-a-0108 390.671000 395.733750 "i think they probably will you know if they i'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer"
sw2638B-ms98-a-0037 179.092250 189.600000 and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason "there may have been a problem" or something did show up
sw2638B-ms98-a-0071 372.011375 379.580125 well then the "company's more profitable" then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere
sw2638B-ms98-a-0072 379.580125 381.518000 "yep all over"
sw2638B-ms98-a-0086 446.413625 450.240875 "i think all around it it's going to help out a lot" course
sw2641A-ms98-a-0010 35.639625 46.360375 not "um i wonder sometimes" [laughter] um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and um
sw2641B-ms98-a-0035 133.533875 147.583750 "then i would do it you know" everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasn't so bad well she had two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of cat litter there
sw2641B-ms98-a-0083 399.793125 412.269750 "how did this work a male rat had been bought" and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick and she said i don't think he's sick i think she's [laughter-pregnant]
sw2641B-ms98-a-0084 412.269750 425.415875 "and they had misclass[ified]- the sex of the" [laughter-the] [laughter-uh] rat there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the size of a mouse
sw2641B-ms98-a-0084 412.269750 425.415875 and they had misclassified the sex of the [laughter-the] [laughter-uh] rat there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like "half the size of a mouse"
sw2642A-ms98-a-0022 153.725000 156.281375 right and "people don't see that either"
sw2642A-ms98-a-0044 305.456625 316.290875 and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know they've got something maybe they've won something you know somebody sent them_1 something free "and go out and spend it"
sw2642A-ms98-a-0050 371.183250 383.464750 and i just don't see it like that of course i always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover that's what you have "but um" maybe a lot of people don't see it like that but i can't stand owing
sw2645A-ms98-a-0004 14.161500 19.666625 "any handicrafts" any handicrafts
sw2645A-ms98-a-0025 118.982750 120.673625 "yes"
sw2645A-ms98-a-0098 470.997125 475.381625 "so yeah i'm looking as as a opportunity"
sw2645B-ms98-a-0042 179.226125 186.185375 "it uh" uh fortunately i guess for myself it wasn't uh it was purely by my own choice
sw2645B-ms98-a-0049 224.377125 235.957250 it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good "but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out"
sw2647A-ms98-a-0010 45.294000 46.991000 "uh-huh"
sw2647A-ms98-a-0023 80.997500 95.726750 y[eah]- yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be i'm sure your classes were a lot smaller um because_1 like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so "actually yes you were a number"
sw2647A-ms98-a-0030 142.399500 153.313875 no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like just W[aco]- like i live in Waco it's a large city "i can still function in" my own kind of
sw2647A-ms98-a-0091 414.997000 423.238375 "would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera" and so forth and and i kept pushing her towards
sw2647B-ms98-a-0023 231.054125 238.301375 all of them "with uh uh uh" accredita[tion]- accreditation to give the education
sw2647B-ms98-a-0071 550.693625 560.983875 those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve whatever "you set your mind on"
sw2648A-ms98-a-0058 372.528250 374.454625 "you know they're water"
sw2648B-ms98-a-0041 197.560000 207.995000 but um we we're on the southwest side of Houston we don't have that much as far as uh "any of the plants over on this uh the we[st]-" east side does
sw2649B-ms98-a-0018 120.799750 123.547625 "fine you for it sh[it]-" it's kind of like
sw2649B-ms98-a-0074 370.471750 376.208250 well i think they actually do some of that but again it's the cost "the cost of processing that it just"
sw2650A-ms98-a-0065 513.805125 522.430375 i don't know if it's really quite hit him hit them [laughter] uh i have two girls "and they" they just been real um
sw2650A-ms98-a-0068 535.499625 543.988250 [laughter] "poor Buddy you [laughter-know]" i said he's only been gone a day and you already want to replace him [laughter] Buddy um-hum [laughter]
sw2650B-ms98-a-0027 132.386875 141.981625 about two years ago it got leukemia "feline leukemia" so we had to have it put to sleep and uh then we got this new cat so i
sw2650B-ms98-a-0043 208.687375 213.994375 "well i i'll i hope you'll find him you most likely will"
sw2651B-ms98-a-0021 82.049625 87.806000 "are more uh" uh kind [vocalized-noise] some ostentatious homes
sw2652A-ms98-a-0018 47.831500 59.083000 i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that i don't go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know "suits and stuff you know"
sw2653A-ms98-a-0032 155.148500 157.281375 "for six hundred dollars"
sw2653A-ms98-a-0040 188.815625 197.974875 and then the keyboard is another fifty the "monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty" and
sw2653B-ms98-a-0078 332.865000 341.779500 "uh i keep track of an inventory here" and of course now that is where a computer is is very handy
sw2654A-ms98-a-0010 24.159000 30.062375 "that's really scary it has it's" done the same thing even in my little town and gosh it's only like a thousand people
sw2654A-ms98-a-0040 155.448375 158.139125 "that's right you never hear about"
sw2656B-ms98-a-0086 401.695250 412.091875 why i should say i i have listened to some others that i like that i can't remember their names offhand my husband makes all these tapes of "all different artists and i never know what i'm listening to"
sw2656B-ms98-a-0096 445.541000 453.026625 sometimes my husband has a whole variety of music so "i really have pretty much anything to choose from"
sw2657A-ms98-a-0004 2.980250 12.552875 well i don't know if i know anything "or not but i've i've got some opinions on it" see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at don't know anything
sw2657A-ms98-a-0048 265.324000 267.993375 "i think" i- i- i i've
sw2657A-ms98-a-0089 448.770875 452.773375 so i i'm wondering if the Peace Corps is "really an effective tool"
sw2657A-ms98-a-0091 459.490375 465.999750 good point we've got enough without "lea[ve]- without a passport there's plenty"
sw2658A-ms98-a-0045 238.188625 240.265125 "what goes on"
sw2658A-ms98-a-0055 268.193375 278.672750 well because_1 these guys if they um give us a hard time we're going to say you look you know if y[ou]- if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're "just returning the computer"
sw2658A-ms98-a-0056 278.672750 289.979375 and if we do that i just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge even though they've already paid it "but they'll just you know" undo the credit that they did to them
sw2658A-ms98-a-0085 432.292875 435.279625 um "oh we[ll]-" [noise]
sw2658A-ms98-a-0111 562.166250 576.921500 give the attitude that well you know you're the last one hired so you'll be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and "we don't really care about you" as an individual when you've got that type of attitude on the people don't care about their work and so
sw2658B-ms98-a-0009 25.995125 27.687000 "right"
sw2659A-ms98-a-0066 322.555250 324.524000 "right right"

sw2661B-ms98-a-0081 219.616875 227.742875 "home cooked Mexican" yeah yeah home cooked Tex-Mex uh Mexican restaurants where
sw2661B-ms98-a-0093 255.350250 260.911375 oh yes [vocalized-noise] "and and there's big differences of course" and

sw2663A-ms98-a-0011 67.900500 78.893500 "well that too that too" and uh you know they talk about the Army and because of the war and why did we win and all that and they talked about how the training was so important and that's so important in industry so
sw2663A-ms98-a-0060 386.974750 388.721375 "and uh"
sw2663A-ms98-a-0062 391.970375 394.469500 "is that right ooh"
sw2663B-ms98-a-0030 137.880625 149.240500 well the the thing that i'm wondering about is "how we get a new congress how do we get" some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them_1

sw2666B-ms98-a-0045 198.564000 203.007750 "so far fetched you know with the normal family life that uh but"
sw2666B-ms98-a-0060 268.906000 271.167125 "and uh"
sw2667A-ms98-a-0010 27.681750 30.643625 "i agree" [laughter]
sw2667A-ms98-a-0101 572.477750 575.977875 "no not at [laughter-all]" [laughter] pretty cheap
sw2667B-ms98-a-0061 366.240750 378.347875 so you know you not only you know you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life so "there's no reason that we shouldn't do it but i don't know"
sw2668B-ms98-a-0062 209.165000 210.496625 "uh-huh"

sw2669A-ms98-a-0081 396.170000 404.591625 yeah except they've got a now okay there we ran into some problems once i remember uh "they've got a a nut and bolts system called Wentworth"
sw2669A-ms98-a-0128 593.054375 599.919625 "in kilometers and you you got to know where you are" because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour but any

sw2671A-ms98-a-0051 262.523250 268.370750 "something along the lines of fifteen thousand forty fives" he has every top forty single
sw2671A-ms98-a-0103 557.213750 570.828125 [laughter] "i don't know it's it's hard for me to" l[isten]- listen to it in true light anymore since i've heard it so many times um i mean i ca[n't]- i mean i want to throw up usually when i hear it [laughter-anymore] i um
sw2672A-ms98-a-0043 232.114625 243.541375 just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of a[ll]- all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage "trucks and stuff"
sw2672A-ms98-a-0066 358.428625 367.183250 true "yeah i noticed that about things like" i s[een]- i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers
sw2672A-ms98-a-0085 460.029500 465.503125 "and apparently they they don't break down" very easily and
sw2672B-ms98-a-0039 304.039375 310.501125 "but i didn't realize that" our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me
sw2672B-ms98-a-0049 391.190250 403.048750 you know companies that do at least go into it i'd like to see subsidy by the government or something or {taxwise} or something heavily enough to where they could get "their prices lower than regular"
sw2672B-ms98-a-0050 403.048750 406.993500 so that people would use this stuff "re[use]- over again"
sw2672B-ms98-a-0068 511.485625 513.787875 "oh i can't think of it now"
sw2672B-ms98-a-0069 513.787875 523.677500 "but i was" i was trying to get my uh kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
sw2674B-ms98-a-0065 339.086875 341.041500 "turns around and does it again"
sw2674B-ms98-a-0070 353.267250 364.200000 no but i don't think uh i don't think it's right for somebody to uh for me to "to uh pay for something i mean the w[ay]- the way it is" right now the prisons are overcrowded
sw2675A-ms98-a-0012 64.342250 75.250000 "in a position like that and say" i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
sw2675A-ms98-a-0016 85.498125 87.997625 "i never have either"
sw2675A-ms98-a-0023 110.490250 118.983750 "somebody told me the other day that there is wha[t]-" what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true
sw2675A-ms98-a-0025 121.219000 132.981375 i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal "case" uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision
sw2675B-ms98-a-0003 1.696500 9.499375 w[ell]- "well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the" jury recommend
sw2675B-ms98-a-0006 14.478750 21.203875 "now my personal opinion" uh i don't know uh uh here lately it seems
sw2675B-ms98-a-0053 287.483000 291.994125 exactly "now that just was not fair"
sw2675B-ms98-a-0102 507.287250 516.400625 well there "well they say a[fter]- after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses"
sw2676A-ms98-a-0068 247.042000 251.061500 "i was" dumb i was in uh Florida for a week
sw2676A-ms98-a-0081 319.636500 325.694000 it's "just going to be" blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through
sw2676A-ms98-a-0093 374.265625 382.081750 "but it is really it's a very nice place uh" i i would cheerfully live there at you know of course it's not my home
sw2676B-ms98-a-0080 305.028500 314.053750 a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded "the streets and stuff around that area" get a lot of flooding
sw2676B-ms98-a-0114 426.603500 428.486125 "right right right"

sw2680A-ms98-a-0099 472.123625 477.864500 i know th[at]- i have some friends that have been on juries that have been deadlocked and it's no fun i mean "because"
sw2680A-ms98-a-0115 548.738500 559.104125 "to go along with it and do the best job we can if we're called it is a duty a lot of people i know try to get out of jury duty when they're" [vocalized-noise] you know and i would never do that because i feel like hey we live in a country
sw2680A-ms98-a-0118 578.020250 585.817500 oh gosh isn't that awf[ul]- that'd be awful um "yeah we're lucky to live in the United States there's no" doubt about it
sw2681B-ms98-a-0004 7.270500 9.566750 "yeah" um-hum
sw2684B-ms98-a-0031 124.719750 129.869375 um "but" you know locking someone up and not getting
sw2685A-ms98-a-0025 128.455750 132.548875 so everything "everything else is mud"
sw2685A-ms98-a-0044 279.638125 292.978250 you would go [vocalized-noise] from having fifty sixty degree days right into the eighty eighty five degree "days" which you know in Texas it's not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty
sw2686A-ms98-a-0010 29.351500 37.663125 i don't usually watch the news at night time "because_1 uh i'm you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it's already over and"
sw2686A-ms98-a-0020 91.061500 96.467750 and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the Soviet "Union i don't blame them either"
sw2687B-ms98-a-0069 278.213125 282.873500 "i don't know i guess i have a little bit more compassion i do think they ought to have their day in court"
sw2687B-ms98-a-0085 363.284125 372.928000 okay i knew it was something like that and i thought jeez that seemed so severe for marijuana but then i thought or is that just because "um"
sw2689B-ms98-a-0052 288.160125 292.291250 yeah yeah it's "frustrating"
sw2690A-ms98-a-0012 57.674000 66.567875 "people" recognized Dallas Texas by the the Texas uh the the cowboys and by that program
sw2690A-ms98-a-0060 379.486750 383.707250 "that was a lot of fun" but
sw2690B-ms98-a-0028 93.766000 105.040250 well it it's uh when you look at the uh you know route seventy five coming down there i i mean it's actually a bridge but it's a bridge over top of roadway there's no water there "i mean" uh
sw2690B-ms98-a-0053 190.938000 198.459000 open your eyes as well as your mind "to some of the problems" and uh i've i've really enjoyed that one since it came on
sw2690B-ms98-a-0105 438.816750 447.662500 and well i d[on't]- really don't need CNN i see enough bad news all the time [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-need] to see more of it "so i" i've kind of uh
sw2691A-ms98-a-0004 14.961250 18.650000 "what's that the" I-30 and Central Express
sw2691A-ms98-a-0081 242.975125 244.928875 "what college are you teaching a[t]-"
sw2692A-ms98-a-0009 34.158500 49.123250 uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but "i change the oil and transmission and"
sw2692A-ms98-a-0011 54.127625 64.568125 uh if there's anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a M E besides but "i do it for fun really and to save money" and i guess that's diversion uh
sw2692A-ms98-a-0040 207.135250 221.095500 that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an insp[ector]- "inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know" just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh
sw2692A-ms98-a-0094 454.295250 458.133250 not to really pull on those i "when i take those hoses i cut them off"
sw2692A-ms98-a-0110 533.605250 545.318625 and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you "have a little curiosity"
sw2692B-ms98-a-0030 131.925625 144.715875 to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection "it didn't it didn't quite pass" so we had to have uh that's uh that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
sw2692B-ms98-a-0083 410.891250 422.389750 and it l[ast]- it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and i[t]- "it's a matter tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but" hey it was not
sw2693B-ms98-a-0065 375.039000 376.407250 "situation yeah"
sw2693B-ms98-a-0098 542.784125 552.957375 but uh we like uh we do like international food so we tend to i like coo[king]- "we like Indian food and" uh i love Italian food and
sw2693B-ms98-a-0109 591.170750 600.068750 "and so really is a treat" because uh you know we don't make a trip sixty five eighty you know sixty five to eighty miles depending how far in Dallas it is
sw2699A-ms98-a-0008 17.664625 23.902500 "uh just the" about two years now yeah yeah so
sw2699A-ms98-a-0031 109.323250 122.811625 right the problem with that in Waco is there's not many stations and so you pretty much depend on tapes [laughter] and CDs etcetera and so on because there's not a whole lot of stations to listen to "um"
sw2700B-ms98-a-0022 152.138250 161.562250 "yeah yeah well i've never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them" and out there was a necessity i mean you don't kill a copperhead with a rock

sw2701A-ms98-a-0043 196.167625 201.038625 "and she had done that and she felt like that helped her"
sw2701A-ms98-a-0054 242.156375 253.250625 unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised "you know if that was happening to your daughter"
sw2703A-ms98-a-0022 110.611375 111.734250 "yeah"
sw2703A-ms98-a-0081 353.311500 359.159500 the ticket the ch[eapest]- "the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty"

sw2703B-ms98-a-0097 373.802750 379.683750 but you know it's in the bleachers way out in the you know center field but it's still nice "you still can see well"
sw2703B-ms98-a-0119 464.647375 472.817250 because everything there's Six Flags right by the stadium there's a Wet'n Wild uh and it you know that's all the tourists come "there and"
sw2704B-ms98-a-0016 63.973250 75.979000 yeah yeah i'm i like to watch the news uh i[f]- if i really know that something's going on because_1 like i say you you can kind of get the headlines and a "pretty quick thumbnail sketch of what's going on"
sw2704B-ms98-a-0049 226.854500 232.043875 "yeah the the the media was more mobilized than the military was i" think
sw2704B-ms98-a-0092 407.526000 413.341125 yeah it's it's you "know s[ome]- uh some of the stuff i don't i don't feel the need"

sw2740B-ms98-a-0019 68.687375 82.815375 like a radio show just like the old days you know it was like from the old days and i was thinking gosh that's i mean because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and "you don't understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it and it's i mean you know it's just too bad that everybody has everything fed to them"
sw2741A-ms98-a-0035 189.612125 204.427500 uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even today i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our girls and "and boys too but but the girls especially"

sw2744B-ms98-a-0018 61.349875 69.227875 "and i know that uh" the results that they get out of the system sometime i[s]- is is certainly not

sw2744B-ms98-a-0071 286.401500 296.185250 yeah it uh right survival becomes more of a priority than "than than education and" unfortunately you know [laughter-there's] [laughter-uh] there's and old joke about uh
sw2744B-ms98-a-0077 338.975750 349.763125 "and uh it's kind of these intervention programs now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism and that's communism" and that's you know and then it gets political

sw2776A-ms98-a-0033 258.752875 262.625125 "so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine"
sw2776A-ms98-a-0039 313.967500 318.500500 "oh i've" done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh
sw2776A-ms98-a-0043 341.872500 354.750625 there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen O three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen "most of the major cities had chlorinated water and then after that" we started having the hearts attacks
sw2776A-ms98-a-0050 390.561250 394.352875 "and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks" and
sw2776A-ms98-a-0060 454.248375 456.815375 "uh Coronaries Cholesterol and Chlorine"
sw2776A-ms98-a-0077 535.257125 537.298625 yeah "i actually"

sw2777B-ms98-a-0068 533.427000 540.326375 "and that's just one of the factors that goes into you know trying to get this place cleaned up but"
sw2777B-ms98-a-0079 587.776625 593.658875 "grew i grew up in Chicago so yeah you know we" had a lot of snow up there

sw2779A-ms98-a-0054 195.116000 205.683500 uh i don't think that'd be any great loss [laughter] we could do without a few of [laughter-those] they don't seem to be providing very much useful uh "service to people"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 10.831250 "yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0002 10.831250 17.288500 "i uh i i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0003 17.288500 23.517375 "i guess like like and though nothing i guess nothing is a[s]- as awful as abortion but like gun control"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0004 23.517375 33.521625 "and uh day care and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know"

sw2780A-ms98-a-0008 49.469875 60.429625 "in in many ways uh very liberal very similar to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0009 60.429625 70.770500 "state so so wh[ere]- where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0010 70.770500 73.330125 "you know so it really is a different um"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0012 78.620000 85.206875 "yeah that's that's true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually"

sw2780A-ms98-a-0014 94.317000 102.546625 "this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i'd really never met people that did"
sw2780A-ms98-a-0015 102.546625 106.061000 "and now i talk to people that do so that's it's really interesting"
sw2780B-ms98-a-0015 109.522750 112.709750 "although i claim Florida as my home now"
sw2782A-ms98-a-0006 20.161125 29.220125 well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh "we're on the east coast now"

sw2782B-ms98-a-0063 320.594250 325.791375 "you know a lot of things like that that really" i[s]- are hard to plan for and uh

sw2784B-ms98-a-0026 202.246375 206.580250 "and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also"
sw2784B-ms98-a-0028 208.570125 215.060500 "areas in which TI stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that"

sw2797A-ms98-a-0012 89.263125 94.164375 "and uh the tax was administered by um"
sw2797A-ms98-a-0033 244.303000 249.976500 "and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education"

sw2799B-ms98-a-0025 77.488500 87.839000 "um they have" i'm not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but
sw2799B-ms98-a-0026 87.839000 99.609625 if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so "really they don't ever huh"
sw2799B-ms98-a-0030 104.085125 117.869750 the problem is with that is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so no one could even take off a day "for pay you know PTO" um because they get penalized for it
sw2801B-ms98-a-0060 249.737875 252.013625 "no i've i've got the LX"
sw2801B-ms98-a-0085 351.033250 356.136750 "so it kind of makes me dread going back to an American manufacturer"
sw2802A-ms98-a-0017 60.699625 66.611625 "the majority of people that live in this area go into Dallas to work and and"
sw2802A-ms98-a-0035 132.037500 144.033625 "see that's that isn't even i mean i'm not sure that a" pers[on]- even a [laughter-percentage] of of of people in the Dallas area ride bikes to work you know i just don't think they do i never see anybody
sw2802A-ms98-a-0042 169.401625 171.131000 "yeah that is an easy one"
sw2802A-ms98-a-0064 288.208625 300.627000 "and we just we have separate garbage collections now for plastics and cans" and newspaper and which i think is i mean that's that should be just a way of life for everybody you shouldn't even complain about it you should just do it
sw2802A-ms98-a-0077 358.040125 369.433375 and besides when i go to the store i have a family you know i- i get maybe ten twelve bags "of groceries and that would be a little" [laughter] a little expensive although you know i'm sure some
sw2802A-ms98-a-0088 407.808000 409.846125 "well you know and they say that"

sw2803A-ms98-a-0038 171.864375 178.633875 being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasn't "before and now he sees and i" think that anybody that works
sw2803A-ms98-a-0151 526.010250 536.728250 and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think "was a big part of of family big part of"
sw2803B-ms98-a-0017 100.311000 107.130875 "yeah and i think the Peace Corps is great too because" uh it you go to different countries and you see
sw2803B-ms98-a-0062 277.244000 288.632250 it's it it's not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean i'm fifty three years old and i have seen "a town change from a town to a city"
sw2803B-ms98-a-0063 288.632250 294.397125 and it's "uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town"

sw2817B-ms98-a-0013 95.640125 105.904250 "you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to" accommodate an elderly person

sw2818B-ms98-a-0012 82.068375 85.352375 "by trading services with them_1"
sw2818B-ms98-a-0035 292.319625 299.879750 li[ving]- having lived in a community for a while and "we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children" and
sw2818B-ms98-a-0039 312.722125 316.202750 "uh care givers are not"
sw2818B-ms98-a-0082 522.879375 524.723625 "just make good friends"
sw2819A-ms98-a-0047 143.336625 147.289625 "yeah that's that's good point" so
sw2819A-ms98-a-0082 230.496375 240.948250 well uh he uh "[laughter-boy]" he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief they they say it's what makes him happy is to give us DADers grief so i can believe it
sw2819B-ms98-a-0042 159.482625 163.986875 "lower class is expanding" and sooner or later there's going to there's going to be a turn around

sw2820A-ms98-a-0004 12.472625 26.523000 if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had "uh coming in" uh were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would uh
sw2820A-ms98-a-0017 56.811000 67.605125 that's true i didn't think about that like for instance uh if someone's working on heavy machinery "or" uh say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that
sw2820A-ms98-a-0024 87.288625 101.762000 yeah for me i think that drug testing just i[t]- "it follows" the path that society's going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs
sw2820A-ms98-a-0067 240.163625 242.047875 "yeah yeah"
sw2820A-ms98-a-0122 412.030125 423.431625 but i hadn't s[it]- had to sit down and and say well what do i think about it [laughter] "you know and that's kind of like today i'm" not real sure what i think about it i'm kind of you know in in the middle on that one
sw2820B-ms98-a-0032 190.293000 196.961125 right well the same here actually i don't use drugs at all and i and i'm at at most a social drinker so it's so it's "never a problem"

sw2825B-ms98-a-0044 302.997250 307.454250 "and all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper marinade"
sw2825B-ms98-a-0054 341.727250 352.794250 and then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm and into that same skillet add the juice "of lemon about" anywhere from a quarter to a half a cup
sw2825B-ms98-a-0060 366.511375 368.317125 "and then"
sw2826A-ms98-a-0007 18.143625 25.124000 "i see i see well" litt[le]- little bit different i think though it was much slower and uh
sw2826A-ms98-a-0031 121.899750 126.425125 because i went there many times and "i never i never saw a riot"
sw2826A-ms98-a-0047 202.494750 209.142750 of basic belief or something down inside of you "then it's very difficult to"
sw2826A-ms98-a-0086 336.196125 340.787000 "in order to flip" things back around the way they needed to be
sw2826A-ms98-a-0119 463.104000 468.200000 "and felt like" they were getting [vocalized-noise] you know uh a good kind of experience as well

sw2830A-ms98-a-0130 532.698250 534.837000 "you must be native Texan"

sw2830A-ms98-a-0135 545.236250 551.593875 "it is um at Purdue i'm trying to think i went to high school in Chicago i'm trying to think what Purdue kids watch"
sw2830A-ms98-a-0138 560.723000 562.157625 "okay"
sw2830A-ms98-a-0140 565.255750 573.529750 ye[ah]- "do you know that i've never i think other then except like on a commercial or on news coverage or something like Entertainment Tonight i've never seen MTV"
sw2830A-ms98-a-0141 573.529750 575.668250 "that's kind of what i've [laughter-heard]"
sw2830A-ms98-a-0143 576.841875 578.342500 "i mean that's yeah"
sw2830A-ms98-a-0145 580.134000 589.069000 "yeah no we don't and i wouldn't even i mean i don't even have cable i don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay somebody t[o]- uh you know give me a hundred and fifty um" [laughter]
sw2830B-ms98-a-0007 15.233000 16.339875 "okay"
sw2830B-ms98-a-0072 246.068875 254.549125 oh "i was gonna say" cause i wondered if you really you know if you had any teams you like watching from up north or something
sw2832A-ms98-a-0012 35.266500 37.443000 i "can't remember i'm sorry" [laughter]
sw2832A-ms98-a-0085 307.788375 322.376875 well that the power makes it run it's never ran it's always ran just fine the clock and stuff "but it runs about ten minutes fast" except for about a month for about a month the the clock ran normal
sw2832A-ms98-a-0132 515.500625 517.809375 "no not six feet but"
sw2832A-ms98-a-0150 594.457500 596.588625 "the home improvements"
sw2832B-ms98-a-0090 348.380125 360.552250 well that's something my husband's in construction and he won't even touch electrical stuff he i- i mean he'll do a little minimal things but he won't do any major rewiring "he" says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it
sw2833A-ms98-a-0006 44.196500 55.941750 "and so i you know am [laughter-am]" probably being very naive [laughter-i'm] [laughter-hoping] that that by by centralizing it it might get better and be cheaper
sw2834A-ms98-a-0014 35.565250 37.920500 "uh you want to start off"
sw2834B-ms98-a-0024 89.371500 102.177000 to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas but i really do "think that women have made a contribution"
sw2834B-ms98-a-0040 201.771375 209.347000 and you know we shouldn't we were made differently "however you come to that conclusion we were"
sw2834B-ms98-a-0070 329.547625 338.954625 yeah it has been and um so there have been major major adjustments "but that's another story" but you know my husband has really really
sw2834B-ms98-a-0095 496.733250 505.160750 you know career woman still have a [laughter-lot] [laughter-of] [laughter-problems] here with the good old boys "here in Texas sort of thing" making career moves but
sw2834B-ms98-a-0096 505.160750 517.270625 um you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents "um" it's just like the way it it has been for years i mean you know
sw2834B-ms98-a-0101 553.875875 567.748750 and so i see i little bit of that and i always wish there was a balance you know with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids and the other gal [laughter-i] [laughter-wish] [laughter-she] [laughter-could] [laughter-just] [laughter-get] [laughter-out] [laughter-of] [laughter-Dodge] [laughter-for] "[laughter-a] [laughter-while] [laughter-and] [laughter-get] [laughter-some] [laughter-peace] [laughter-and] [laughter-quiet]"
sw2834B-ms98-a-0105 577.824750 582.166375 "that's true that's so true how how did your daughter do it"
sw2835A-ms98-a-0055 328.058000 337.506375 "uh guesswork uh" because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like uh hepatitis and then
sw2835A-ms98-a-0073 428.937000 438.384125 "in my day" we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping [laughter-with] [laughter-their] [laughter-boyfriends]
sw2835A-ms98-a-0076 458.038750 459.405250 "nowadays"
sw2837A-ms98-a-0010 74.587375 83.848875 but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch "style home" uh after having a
sw2837A-ms98-a-0026 199.479000 209.094625 and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh "trek to the east because" we're both originally from this part of the country
sw2837A-ms98-a-0035 267.488500 275.610375 anyway "it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding" that i got all those bricks for forty dollars
sw2837A-ms98-a-0058 387.732000 402.408625 "we laid the i did get some material [noise]" and studied every bit of material that i could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of s[and]- sand
sw2837A-ms98-a-0064 439.644500 451.500625 and and prob[ably]- you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there "on a"
sw2837B-ms98-a-0064 274.181750 277.197000 "oh my word"
sw2837B-ms98-a-0128 522.057625 525.304375 real "funny about what she sprays"
sw2839B-ms98-a-0040 189.622625 198.035625 uh whether you're mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly President "that uh two terms is plenty"
sw2839B-ms98-a-0041 198.035625 205.607250 and then we get these professionals out of there and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than "living off of us"
sw2839B-ms98-a-0060 295.413500 301.260000 they don't even talk about that they just raise it they don't even consider it like you "saying is to cut something back you know"
sw2840A-ms98-a-0056 363.916375 370.845000 "um there" i mean i mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide
sw2843A-ms98-a-0009 64.766875 78.605250 "as i uh went along when i started uh at first" i had to uh i didn't have to use my arms all that much to uh you know get the heart rate up but then after about uh
sw2843A-ms98-a-0009 64.766875 78.605250 as i uh went along when i started uh at first i had to uh i didn't have to use my arms all that much to uh you know get the heart rate up "but then after about uh"
sw2843A-ms98-a-0012 95.200125 104.278500 yeah i thought well now i guess probably six weeks before i had to do my arms the whole time "the whole twenty minutes"
sw2843A-ms98-a-0048 408.477000 411.241375 hum-um "yes" yes
sw2844A-ms98-a-0089 357.553000 368.253250 "oh yeah oh yeah" so that's ano[ther]- uh we jus[t]- a little dog now but he is just as vicious as if you know if you if somebody and loud
sw2844A-ms98-a-0089 357.553000 368.253250 oh yeah oh yeah so that's "ano[ther]- uh" we jus[t]- a little dog now but he is just as vicious as if you know if you if somebody and loud
sw2845A-ms98-a-0006 27.080000 33.216375 "yes like the Lehrer News" Hour or something yeah i think that's that's helpful i think that's right
sw2845A-ms98-a-0042 188.044500 199.341125 different point of view yeah i think you have to be very careful in "i[t]- with the media in tha[t]-" for that reason because they they are not because they are very biased
sw2845A-ms98-a-0079 380.102625 384.181500 "and stand up for yourself decide what you think and"
sw2847A-ms98-a-0014 62.168125 65.726375 "that does cut into your reading" time a lot
sw2847A-ms98-a-0026 114.023500 121.854500 it really is it "it's a great place to be and" the uh it's nice to work with people uh who
sw2847A-ms98-a-0055 298.675875 304.026375 "the British novel" so it's it's really quite interesting i haven't got too far into it yet

sw2847A-ms98-a-0110 557.711875 569.778625 there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is "uh reprinting those" the James Thurber books for children
sw2847B-ms98-a-0069 324.279125 327.605875 my goodness well that's "fascinating gosh"

sw2848B-ms98-a-0107 434.398625 441.697125 "well it's it's kind of near Abilene but it's it's uh about halfway in between here and and Abilene"
sw2849A-ms98-a-0012 32.656375 39.677000 "and it was a a cultural shock to me" uh in terms of what i went through the high school's now called R[oberto]- in fact
sw2849B-ms98-a-0077 337.782750 344.183000 most of the people who that i "that i know about who really" uh would

sw2855B-ms98-a-0141 574.041125 583.411625 yeah when we were living in California people all the time went in the winter you know up in the mountains and stuff i don't know i can't see that [laughter-either] "um south of San Francisco"
sw2856B-ms98-a-0058 453.615625 459.164000 "well i'm on my second career currently and i'm i'm just too old to start a third"
sw2856B-ms98-a-0060 462.740875 468.275500 "or too tired" uh i don't i don't [laughter-know] that i'm too old but i'm too tired to start a third career
sw2858A-ms98-a-0063 362.384875 367.900250 yeah but i think that's for the "the few and far between i think that" uh
sw2858B-ms98-a-0025 87.010125 99.507000 um from the people i've talked to i don't know if i should bring this into it but um a lot of the dads said that they would "probably choose careers that are more um where they could manage their own schedule"
sw2858B-ms98-a-0026 99.507000 104.716500 "and uh" they could spend more time with their kids because they look back and you know they're all like
sw2858B-ms98-a-0066 278.558750 289.370250 my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that but i i don't know "it was [noise] i guess i didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time"
sw2859A-ms98-a-0068 357.237750 359.286875 so "now i know"
sw2860A-ms98-a-0077 377.557125 392.529125 and so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed "and all these i think are very important parts of them growing up" so we
sw2860A-ms98-a-0084 430.843250 443.571250 and that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had now this year it's been was hard with our son now being in college so this was one thing that we "um weren't able to do this year but we did that for" e[ver]-
sw2860A-ms98-a-0098 481.980875 489.402875 "and i mean they look" today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us and there's a ring and you buy a present
sw2860B-ms98-a-0023 114.229250 125.250500 "well we didn't have any uh" avid uh activities like that th[ey]- they were interested in a lot of things but nothing to quite that depth i guess but
sw2862A-ms98-a-0017 88.692125 90.715375 "oh man"
sw2862A-ms98-a-0022 112.488875 123.165375 "and uh course" uh all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in in California um and it also helps when they were winning [laughter]

sw2866A-ms98-a-0079 332.970500 344.571625 and i find that really interesting you know to imagine here is somebody that was in China l[ast]- "two years ago when all that was going on in in uh Beijing you know that that's an interesting uh"
sw2866A-ms98-a-0088 401.999375 409.227750 something like a [noise] uh state auditor or something like that before "this position she was a state auditor"

sw2869B-ms98-a-0075 366.525375 380.417375 "they actually are forced to take time off and pick an area of study" it's proctored it's you know regulated and all that sort of thing um but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own thing on a particular subject and it doesn't matter what it is
sw2870A-ms98-a-0031 142.029750 146.315625 [laughter] "i'm twenty six" [laughter]

sw2870A-ms98-a-0074 301.268625 305.692125 right and like i said most of the poli[ticians]- "the politicians i'm" the

sw2870A-ms98-a-0117 433.273750 435.915875 "and it just threw him out of the whole running"
sw2870B-ms98-a-0126 435.605500 436.633875 "yeah"
sw2870B-ms98-a-0141 481.461625 491.171250 "i think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country's being run is that" um the the election
sw2870B-ms98-a-0145 520.577625 529.405125 any of the TV commercials from the last presidential campaign "they all had uh" pictures of Bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and

sw2873B-ms98-a-0017 86.557125 93.456500 um-hum "i you know like i said i like Isaiah Thomas but i think sometimes that uh"
sw2873B-ms98-a-0059 311.137375 325.309250 you know i think sometimes it's interesting we we really watch the big name players "and but they have to have a solid team underneath or else they really don't" don't go anywhere
sw2873B-ms98-a-0083 437.403750 448.615000 i guess i like it because of of the quickness of it um and and i like it because it takes "the players"

sw2927A-ms98-a-0030 144.294750 146.413125 "oh there you go okay"
sw2927B-ms98-a-0008 18.746750 20.986125 "oh north Dallas"
sw2929A-ms98-a-0120 422.387875 424.817375 "for some of the different fields"
sw2929A-ms98-a-0144 493.714000 502.197250 "yeah" yeah take their rights away from them they say [laughter] i never had the desire so i haven't ever had that problem
sw2929B-ms98-a-0023 96.996125 102.117625 "oh absolutely that the choice would be yours"
sw2929B-ms98-a-0029 150.483500 155.304250 "well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit"
sw2929B-ms98-a-0033 166.962375 170.451875 "and hopefully that they would have their um"
sw2929B-ms98-a-0051 231.632125 232.806875 "um"
sw2929B-ms98-a-0088 373.051125 376.495500 "well i have a brother that lives there" [laughter]
sw2930A-ms98-a-0069 253.268000 265.104375 and we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out we you know we "we" searched for dock and we ate the wild plants and we gathered wild berries and uh [noise] it's really
sw2932A-ms98-a-0011 73.194000 83.332375 uh "the two extra rooms enclosed" i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office
sw2932A-ms98-a-0051 393.063625 402.709625 and an and while while there are some advantages to that [laughter] "there's less time spent outside making it look nice" and taking care of things uh
sw2932A-ms98-a-0066 496.359500 502.764625 "eighty five" i started looking and it seemed like the further i got away from Dallas center
sw2932B-ms98-a-0075 380.856125 390.701500 "yeah when you get down closer in to the newer track homes" you find almost like there's no lot line at all they're built practically on top of each other
sw2932B-ms98-a-0084 427.119875 433.501500 "but i'm like you i came down from Colorado" and there was more land up there around the yard
sw2933A-ms98-a-0006 23.338375 25.162875 "um i have" been
sw2934A-ms98-a-0018 84.997250 99.772375 not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh "into our area North Carolina"
sw2934A-ms98-a-0042 212.739750 223.222625 hm well we've had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh Bangla[desh]- "Bangladesh boy they" they caught it bad [laughter]
sw2934B-ms98-a-0076 346.338875 355.227625 "and the" the camera man on the news crew held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by
sw2935B-ms98-a-0044 210.047375 218.307625 um we've tried them_1 but again it's just like the sun scorch we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s[un]- "i mean it's just"
sw2935B-ms98-a-0045 218.307625 225.289625 see "you really really" have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation
sw2936A-ms98-a-0015 116.999625 121.027000 "that uh mother Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer"
sw2936A-ms98-a-0061 336.802000 349.198250 "that uh i mean i" it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i- i think i'm correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget i[s]- i[s]- is allocated now for debt payments
sw2936A-ms98-a-0077 479.620500 487.271750 i guess it is the truth we just keep [laughter-buying] [laughter-this] [laughter-stuff] "and we don't have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas"
sw2937B-ms98-a-0069 254.884375 260.535500 but tha[t]- it it exists is what i'm saying "those avenues exist"
sw2938A-ms98-a-0018 49.234625 52.066000 "that's causing the hole in the ozone"
sw2938A-ms98-a-0050 197.349625 202.320000 "well see they have that um uh what is it a vet" test or something like that they call it
sw2938A-ms98-a-0066 253.218000 264.751625 because of that smoke fumes when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it because back then i was walking back and forth to K[entucky]- from "well not back and forth i was walking home from uh"
sw2938A-ms98-a-0089 357.112000 369.826375 but they i don't hear much about it down here course Texas we don't have a bunch of [vocalized-noise] "pollution" but too we've got that air coming in off the coast and you know it'd blow it up north
sw2938A-ms98-a-0127 526.660875 530.895875 "well it's fun i like talking to new people" and i

sw2938A-ms98-a-0139 585.044250 598.018125 and his family's "down here we're out of the service now" but yeah he got out of it his unit right after Panama we went to Pana[ma]- he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that
sw2938B-ms98-a-0015 73.813625 82.569625 Kentucky uh North Carolina is all the way on the east coast "it's further west than Georgia it's uh right below Virginia"
sw2938B-ms98-a-0073 322.861375 335.991125 and i don't think i'd ever you know do that but "they uh asked me if i was a smoker and i didn't fit into the smoker's category and i didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category" um it was you know i was just one of those
sw2938B-ms98-a-0129 514.958875 517.053000 "oh i see huh"

sw2940B-ms98-a-0026 130.728750 135.861250 "but he maintains his weight now because he jogs like uh nine miles a day"
sw2940B-ms98-a-0037 202.071000 211.940625 "um attitude about exercise otherwise it becomes a chore and a task and" and you you think of it as work and um
sw2940B-ms98-a-0095 443.673125 451.866250 uh faculties that run the body your brain and your "flesh and your bones and all of that and" eating is a pleasure
sw2940B-ms98-a-0105 477.393500 481.101500 "marvelous health clubs too that you know you can use their facilities"
sw2941A-ms98-a-0013 34.663625 37.971875 "but uh but that's i wear normally just wear like"
sw2941A-ms98-a-0017 59.761625 64.340625 "and uh i'm just in my lab and" no one sees me then i'm probably okay

sw2941A-ms98-a-0052 164.017125 178.625750 um-hum that's right where the the uniform a[s]- as a waitress now your uniform really it might be a little expensive when you first buy it but "you know" that's it doesn't it's made of polyester so it doesn't stain like cotton or wool would you know
sw2941A-ms98-a-0093 292.853875 303.127125 a large area you know probably probably "that's why i get because sometimes boy i'll get i'll freeze it's so cold in there" especially when it's ninety degrees outside
sw2941A-ms98-a-0096 313.077375 324.008750 and i wanted to be comfortable because i thought the air conditioning would be all turned off you know "and jeez if it wasn't the" air conditioner wasn't blowing it wasn't fifty five degrees yeah
sw2941A-ms98-a-0113 405.605125 419.521625 that's probably true without being laughed at uh-huh "yeah i'm not i've never i laugh at the wardrobe my father-in-law wears golf" clothes and it's the only time he puts on those funny clothes yeah he doesn't wear those in the back yard or casually around
sw2941A-ms98-a-0129 476.550750 487.120375 you know which is popular with the kids and "and she says oh and you know uh i wouldn't put the gel in my hair you know in other words you're to borrow a s[uit]- two or three piece suit"

sw2956A-ms98-a-0070 541.419125 544.897375 "conversation we can only do our own reactions"
sw2956B-ms98-a-0043 163.998750 168.514375 right i think that is the biggest one "that's the biggest problem" i
sw2956B-ms98-a-0086 391.482250 397.199125 well then why did he say that during his campaign then he sh[ould]- it was "totally [vocalized-noise]"

sw2978A-ms98-a-0084 405.763125 419.523000 well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that y[ou]- you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer "i really don't want that" [laughter]
sw2979B-ms98-a-0063 355.534500 359.802250 "yeah they do it's what about_1 two dollars a pack now"

sw2982A-ms98-a-0112 361.804625 367.044125 "but uh the rest of the time i've been an [laughter-Avon] lady and a [vocalized-noise] lady" [laughter]
sw2982A-ms98-a-0134 422.160875 424.316875 "uh-huh uh-huh"
sw2982B-ms98-a-0057 209.140000 212.891125 and you[r]- and your and your hours "are much more constrained and things like that"
sw2982B-ms98-a-0073 289.070250 292.000625 uh-huh "is that locally"
sw2982B-ms98-a-0080 315.200875 325.088000 "like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um" any where between ten and forty hours a week
sw2982B-ms98-a-0081 325.088000 329.466625 "and" um you know c[all]- call my own days call my own hours and
sw2982B-ms98-a-0106 423.140500 434.190500 and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits he doesn't get well "we don't care about retirement benefits he doesn't get um" vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that
sw2983B-ms98-a-0077 327.255750 340.134375 [laughter] did you have to listen to long stories about how on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way [laughter] those are it's hard for me to "[laughter] act nice about that when he goes on and on [laughter]"
sw2984A-ms98-a-0010 33.979625 41.424375 <b_aside> i have no idea "he didn't broadcast" thank you uh-huh <e_aside> i'm sorry go ahead
sw2984A-ms98-a-0020 96.118625 110.058250 cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over "the territory" i was surprised how easy it was
sw2984A-ms98-a-0040 217.165500 223.496625 that's one of the hazards i guess of uh "having a a yard" because i
sw2984B-ms98-a-0008 17.000625 30.388000 and uh but grew up in uh Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of [laughter] lawn and garden "work" uh and uh
sw2984B-ms98-a-0019 74.731750 88.840875 have a lawn service there was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh "weed control" mainly leave that up to them what about you
sw2984B-ms98-a-0086 359.006000 362.908125 "yeah and it it just it just ripped it" r[ight]-
sw2984B-ms98-a-0092 379.467125 388.519250 back by the garage that i filled in with and "and it's filling in with with grass uh" nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but uh
sw2985B-ms98-a-0027 169.953750 178.564375 "as as the years go by they run surveys to see how many women are CEOs or on the" boards of major companies and the number is creeping up very
sw2988A-ms98-a-0013 61.289125 68.447750 well i don't know if uh [vocalized-noise] you mean they keep the children "they want the teachers to keep the children longer"
sw2988A-ms98-a-0016 72.181125 81.737875 uh what do you mean by that statement do you mean they want the ch[ildren]- uh the teachers to keep the children longer than they're supposed to "or are they" [vocalized-noise] to train them
sw2988A-ms98-a-0027 123.594375 135.163000 well it's just gotten uh completely out of hand as far as the violence in the schools "and i don't know what the solution to that is at all" i mean its just uh
sw2988A-ms98-a-0039 204.819000 212.191250 uh suffer the consequences and "and that was enough for them i mean they just" were very responsible
sw2988A-ms98-a-0045 252.791000 256.894625 "well i guess that's the bottom line if the children do know right from wrong"
sw2989A-ms98-a-0010 57.557875 64.267000 and we've always uh "oh tried to take our children and now" now this age our grandchildren
sw2990B-ms98-a-0018 52.628000 63.334750 "and uh it's funny because_1 KVIL back when i was a teenager was an AM station i think yeah" and uh it used to have like the top twenty top forty all the time you know
sw2991B-ms98-a-0008 26.283625 30.893375 in some in some instances they're "they're over used"
sw2991B-ms98-a-0019 86.821875 89.119750 "a lot of times uh"
sw2991B-ms98-a-0024 111.453125 121.323000 if they "if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh" they want to to format a report a certain way
sw2991B-ms98-a-0048 251.803500 254.652875 "that you see like in a newspaper"
sw2992B-ms98-a-0044 191.042750 203.367250 well i did watch it just to see what it was and w[asn't]- it wasn't really that great so i think "after a while they just kind of" you know there's no new stuff they can do they've done everything dirty in the book you know so
sw2993A-ms98-a-0056 319.870750 331.830000 but once you get if you s[tart]- once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area "you can be really" and the parts i know the Audi parts are terribly expensive
sw2993B-ms98-a-0079 350.298250 351.656750 "right"
sw2994A-ms98-a-0002 2.656000 10.806250 "well a little bit" we mostly do our newspapers we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled
sw2994A-ms98-a-0054 260.607750 270.706250 hm nah i didn't know that because_1 we just usually if we're gonna um buy sodas they're in the "the two liter bottles"
sw2995B-ms98-a-0026 128.509625 131.589750 "but telephone calls"
sw2995B-ms98-a-0058 259.717250 263.786500 you know answering service anyway "unless i'm home"
sw2996A-ms98-a-0019 88.722250 96.017625 and then you know too that uh taxes are are less like if you "live in Mesquite"
sw2997B-ms98-a-0025 180.337750 192.064375 being helped gracefully uh i- "i myself have done a lot of volunteer work" but i am very apprehensive about accepting help
sw2997B-ms98-a-0084 420.293250 430.670500 i don't know that may or may not be "uh a useful choice but i do know that there are a great deal of young people out there who would say why do i want to go"
sw2998A-ms98-a-0034 170.607125 183.345750 that research really be directed toward um improvement "of polluting" vehicles and not just cars but also buses um [noise] planes
sw2998A-ms98-a-0087 393.347875 402.200625 yeah well i- "i d[efinetely]- definitely advance that" well listen i enjoyed speaking with you and let's hope some there are other people that feel the same way [laughter]
sw2998B-ms98-a-0011 77.128500 78.474375 "yeah"
sw2998B-ms98-a-0029 200.678000 212.680500 and no lead gas was came to the pumps and and that's been done there's the lead pollution has that problem "essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was" was licked
sw3001A-ms98-a-0052 252.097375 261.395625 yeah "well um" i can just tell you like you know from my dad and my fiancee like my dad well there's twelve kids in my family
sw3002A-ms98-a-0022 184.095875 193.602000 r[ight]- right it's the "same thing with the news magazines like Time and and the other magazines it's hard to celebr[ate]- uh to celebrate" to separate
sw3002A-ms98-a-0023 193.602000 202.021250 "the news from the comment because in the" way it's presented their opinions is printed or presented as being the news
sw3002A-ms98-a-0047 325.174625 332.562000 and thoroughly read a newspaper "as a matter of fact i read the Sunday paper this evening" we had such a busy day yesterday
sw3002B-ms98-a-0073 333.998750 335.565375 "yeah"
sw3003A-ms98-a-0047 249.008625 256.632500 you know it's it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it you know if we're going to get anything out of it so "so i'm i'm"
sw3003B-ms98-a-0049 301.592125 313.474250 and we have had just wonderful luck with ours i mean it's "we take it everywhere it" [laughter] it's been i[t's]- i[t's]- it's so easy to get the kids in and out see my car was also a two door
sw3005B-ms98-a-0006 35.374625 42.019750 best for the whole uh kind of a thing uh "does that make any sense or"
sw3005B-ms98-a-0010 55.421250 69.521250 Congress and and uh is i[s]- "they g[et]- they get reelected by what they do for their districts uh" in terms of bringing in and bringing in money and and uh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0036 221.653250 233.496125 uh they would prefer fresh stick veggies as opposed to chips and dips although there are some hard crust "chips and dippers" uh
sw3006B-ms98-a-0049 304.486375 318.164625 "and uh as far as the the party snacks uh" i may fix a trail mix or a caramel popcorn for snacking as opposed to what pure peanuts
sw3007B-ms98-a-0020 144.439750 154.491625 since they've become so popular "you get what i call backyard breeders" which is probably where yours came from people that don't know what they're doing and
sw3007B-ms98-a-0024 184.029125 197.800250 uh "trainable tractable quiet" animal that could hunt and still be in the house and i ended up getting one that uh came out of a a a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did
sw3008A-ms98-a-0003 2.032625 9.644375 "fringe benefits are very important in the comp[any]-" in the company i think to provide the employee with a sense of security
sw3008A-ms98-a-0010 44.426500 50.225625 "oh about eight or nine years since we had dental coverage and it sure makes a difference"
sw3008A-ms98-a-0093 415.831500 419.182500 "okay fine" it's been nice talking with you
sw3009A-ms98-a-0045 253.194625 255.849875 "oh i would be too" [laughter]
sw3009A-ms98-a-0059 326.172750 327.851000 "uh-huh"

sw3010B-ms98-a-0034 126.840625 134.148500 "true that's true um" i i'm a very selective watcher i- i look at the TV section and
sw3011A-ms98-a-0041 169.241750 180.777250 uh-huh one thing about the houses in uh in Dallas "they don't uh utilize basements" the way they did in New York
sw3011A-ms98-a-0042 180.777250 183.563625 "my parents in New York had uh"
sw3011B-ms98-a-0003 5.295625 12.481875 "now i understand that um the the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down"
sw3011B-ms98-a-0042 287.429875 293.720500 and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast [laughter] "it's just solid sandstone"
sw3011B-ms98-a-0051 343.735125 352.496375 [noise] that's the same way out here because_1 um well we for example and we live "fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington"
sw3011B-ms98-a-0052 352.496375 359.769000 "and anything inside that beltway the highway" the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
sw3011B-ms98-a-0061 418.491000 425.901000 oh no "huh-uh yeah its uh a stand alone single family home" i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up

sw3013A-ms98-a-0062 294.056625 308.562125 "and like" [laughter] now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it's just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i don't like that so
sw3013A-ms98-a-0069 333.007625 334.352500 "he's eleven"
sw3013A-ms98-a-0085 409.961000 416.101875 "like a plate over the top" and let it steam and then and then stir it up
sw3013A-ms98-a-0085 409.961000 416.101875 like a plate over the top and let it steam "and then and then stir it up"

sw3018A-ms98-a-0032 86.642250 93.095375 well i think i think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way but "they had a lot of" uh
sw3018A-ms98-a-0048 156.549125 164.716375 "i haven't uh" uh there are not as many good shows that i that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to

sw3038B-ms98-a-0041 225.552000 233.636500 "going in [vocalized-noise] going to uh" and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong uh and then she put in to go see him
sw3038B-ms98-a-0042 233.636500 245.134500 "and over time she uh uh finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle"

sw3063A-ms98-a-0073 369.517500 372.663500 "perhaps the" first grade level which would be
sw3063B-ms98-a-0007 20.770250 28.761875 uh "just by the vast number of people there are there's" i think cars are also a major contributor to it

sw3064B-ms98-a-0046 230.389500 234.214125 that's right "that's right"
sw3065B-ms98-a-0100 405.506500 408.776500 "probably ate all your merchandise too"
sw3067A-ms98-a-0042 188.654500 192.536625 wh[y]- "why why do you think that it's less close than it used to be"
sw3067B-ms98-a-0016 91.402500 98.909875 "not getting to go" uh just uh the distance involved and uh just not
sw3067B-ms98-a-0031 153.956250 161.132750 brothers and sisters so it was a large reunion of of of of that group "uh from that {descendancy}"
sw3067B-ms98-a-0040 219.975750 231.290625 "the family" grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together it's it's generally you know like say the ki[ds]- kids of those people who are not
sw3067B-ms98-a-0050 291.938500 302.260000 i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh "it's it doesn't it's not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing"
sw3068A-ms98-a-0054 262.292875 263.777375 "uh-huh"
sw3068B-ms98-a-0027 158.130875 163.196875 oh yeah "yeah well yeah i see what you're saying"

sw3069A-ms98-a-0066 221.691000 224.568500 right i wouldn't be "surprised yeah"
sw3069A-ms98-a-0074 294.070625 303.519500 it was written i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety one so it's a brand new book "yeah uh-huh" yeah and he really this man really shed some light on um
sw3069A-ms98-a-0074 294.070625 303.519500 it was written i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety one so it's a brand new book yeah uh-huh yeah and he really this man "really shed some light on um"
sw3069A-ms98-a-0079 330.957750 334.521125 y[eah]- "yeah so um" it was just really interesting if that's
sw3069B-ms98-a-0024 114.147375 117.452375 yeah and she's more famous for that "but she has been writing"
sw3069B-ms98-a-0025 117.452375 126.029875 "for adults also and" so i thought hey i'll just try this you know and see what it was like it was very um [noise] the style was very conversational
sw3069B-ms98-a-0071 322.510000 328.998625 yeah and they just went from generation probably to generation just "with these with these all passing it from one to the other"
sw3070B-ms98-a-0029 114.532250 121.770375 well it's a community center it's a community "hall it's a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen in it"
sw3070B-ms98-a-0030 121.770375 132.454125 and uh you just bring the covered dishes every every family brings a a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been "handed down for years"
sw3072A-ms98-a-0015 45.632500 47.769750 "oh that would be enjoyable"
sw3072A-ms98-a-0031 123.925250 134.727125 the woods that he'd come in his little log "boat down the river and" we would have to we'd [vocalized-noise] and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and
sw3072A-ms98-a-0047 176.964875 179.833000 "and then i went to England"
sw3072A-ms98-a-0060 264.349875 266.423875 it "was really interesting"
sw3072B-ms98-a-0043 160.690125 164.360000 "because it's something you weren't forced to do" [laughter]
sw3072B-ms98-a-0091 341.741000 345.157750 "what did you wind up with" [laughter]
sw3073A-ms98-a-0017 39.593500 47.922000 "that type of show but we like L A Law we like" that we're just i'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there
sw3073A-ms98-a-0028 99.532500 103.998000 right which they do at the beginning of the season "to grab your attention"
sw3073A-ms98-a-0031 121.779875 135.388750 so i like things like Golden Girls or Cheers or uh Monday night is real good with me you know Major Dad and and uh uh "Northern Exposure and and uh oh what's that one with Burt Reynolds"
sw3073A-ms98-a-0035 168.787625 178.122500 well you we watched it the times we've seen it it's been like on Satur[day]- "or excuse me Friday night" uh but it's we've only seen it a couple of times but it
sw3073A-ms98-a-0042 230.920500 242.855375 the as the one that questions "um" the what's going on and uh in the end of uh the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff uh
sw3073A-ms98-a-0044 256.554625 260.485750 "because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and"
sw3073B-ms98-a-0028 76.755000 78.739000 "i know isn't that funny"
sw3074A-ms98-a-0028 139.699500 140.963875 "yes"
sw3074B-ms98-a-0023 140.413750 147.468250 "and um" and of course then you know you try to buy right too but um
sw3074B-ms98-a-0047 251.654625 262.983000 th[en]- and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and "dad used to do that" and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's not such a bad way to go but
sw3074B-ms98-a-0052 300.607750 308.237875 you you've got to be in a country even in in Mexico "you don't see things thrown away like" we do here
sw3074B-ms98-a-0084 432.398875 439.386625 of the American public i think what they will do is start "paying Mexico" to take our trash
sw3075A-ms98-a-0019 75.427250 89.509625 uh i'd like i'd like to do that but anyway that's that's our typical vacation and uh we enjoy the family vacations but the other ones are very special getaways [vocalized-noise] and we probably take one of each every year "how about yourself"
sw3075A-ms98-a-0025 119.540000 120.876500 "yeah"
sw3075A-ms98-a-0101 432.504500 437.866125 "i i mean as i said" we[ll]- w[ell]- basically all i've done is go back and forth to parents and uh
sw3075B-ms98-a-0025 95.884625 104.156125 and but this year we're not going to be taking one for "several reasons" but vacations we really enjoy i think we've been on three cruises
sw3075B-ms98-a-0036 174.776625 184.553375 and then we went to uh the western Caribbean which is uh Port uh "Cancun" Cozumel
sw3076B-ms98-a-0043 201.771875 209.601000 and it was placed in a actually it was placed clear closer to my neighborhood but it was on the right side of the "street"
sw3078A-ms98-a-0018 121.207750 136.065000 uh she portrayed as a male "and the nurse well i'm just i'm just thinking of pictures that i've" seen and and you know uh uh i- i suspect no no message was ever intended to be while what you have to be this gender
sw3079B-ms98-a-0008 20.707000 27.446500 uh my husband's been unemployed for a little more than a year "so we've kind of uh"
sw3079B-ms98-a-0054 227.255125 232.894625 and i do shop the sales and "buy more than what we need"
sw3079B-ms98-a-0055 232.894625 240.950250 "so that i've got it ahead of time and i don't have to go out and buy it something not on sale because i've already gotten it on sale"
sw3079B-ms98-a-0075 323.627750 332.878000 "and i think since being unemployed we" look you look at things more carefully you know do i really need this or is it just something i want
sw3080A-ms98-a-0087 306.341250 311.720875 it's i guess pretty "pretty healthy but i don't have an a regular plan that's"
sw3080A-ms98-a-0105 362.559000 365.759750 "that'll come" some day when i
sw3080A-ms98-a-0109 372.568875 375.657875 well i hope so "yeah sounds good"
sw3080B-ms98-a-0026 114.017875 125.526125 "that i don't get any" exercise doing that and plus there's a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner and i need to go out in the morning and run or i'll just get nuts
sw3080B-ms98-a-0043 230.125250 243.223750 yeah so so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice i love her you know i enjoy being with her i guess that's one thing but also "uh that that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles"
sw3080B-ms98-a-0069 347.184125 359.145875 or you know it it it's always trade-offs and you actually "have to as you get older you have to really" think what can go and what to to to replace this thing it's i mean not just exercise but anything it's
sw3081A-ms98-a-0004 18.051750 21.721125 probably a lettuce salad "an[d]- a"
sw3081B-ms98-a-0040 170.136375 183.759625 you take a flour tortilla "and you fry it like a taco" shell and you uh for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um
sw3081B-ms98-a-0044 217.069875 224.300125 see what's next [noise] "then and i- i usually put the cut up tomatoes next"
sw3081B-ms98-a-0081 379.868500 386.322750 i don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it [laughter] "poultry instead of the beef and"
sw3082B-ms98-a-0002 1.299250 2.205000 "yes"
sw3082B-ms98-a-0004 6.570750 9.623625 "oh are you really where" is it going to be
sw3082B-ms98-a-0059 231.924500 239.751500 but then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out they're going to have it at Fort Davis "and we thought that would be"
sw3082B-ms98-a-0082 302.260250 303.607500 "uh-huh"
sw3083A-ms98-a-0019 112.373500 121.048625 "i think have" probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than
sw3083A-ms98-a-0029 204.016375 212.633500 the uh schools like that that "where you got" a lot of kids who are basically uh
sw3083A-ms98-a-0030 212.633500 224.649625 that might be more well to well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are "um"
sw3083A-ms98-a-0031 224.649625 233.985500 that they're they're "they're not quite the same as as the kids that are going to the inner city" uh you know public schools
sw3083A-ms98-a-0036 276.406875 286.864750 "uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents" have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be
sw3083B-ms98-a-0020 233.931250 244.836375 yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of "environment but uh" this this was actually inner city
sw3084B-ms98-a-0060 250.171000 257.669125 a quality home "even the homes that i see that are that they're building out in North Dallas where they're paying"
sw3084B-ms98-a-0077 306.245250 314.619000 it's ridiculous i just feel very "very disheartened ab[out]-" about the way i see the building industry go
sw3084B-ms98-a-0089 374.381875 377.741250 "that's what's wrong they're not stringent enough"
sw3085B-ms98-a-0031 126.690375 130.657500 oh absolutely "without a doubt" um-hum
sw3085B-ms98-a-0059 297.144625 303.318875 "and hold them" but when time came to direct their ability to make choices
sw3086A-ms98-a-0033 141.592875 150.864375 word t[ext]- "word text processing" so i don't i don't use [vocalized-noise] i mean you can call it word processing but i don't usually use a word processor to do it
sw3086B-ms98-a-0037 183.150750 186.103250 "so you've got you've got a modem in it then"
sw3086B-ms98-a-0040 193.417875 201.196500 uh and so it's an external modem i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it "i used it uh quite a bit when i was um"
sw3086B-ms98-a-0060 320.090250 334.264125 "i have uh i have used Lotus i have used uh Word Perfect" uh i not heavy use i've used uh D Base and uh i've used a substantial amount of shareware
sw3086B-ms98-a-0065 362.377125 375.901750 granddaddy of most uh data base management systems there it's got some pretty uh strong competitors some of them have "reviews that are better than D Base so i uh i uh i think uh by now it's a matter of uh personal taste"
sw3086B-ms98-a-0073 406.878125 417.444000 i'm a computer programmer on the IBM main frames [noise] i do uh main "mainly business data processing"
sw3087A-ms98-a-0006 7.330625 9.065750 "why did i pick music"
sw3087A-ms98-a-0008 13.984000 16.941500 "i like uh" to listen to music
sw3087A-ms98-a-0102 366.948625 371.011750 oh yeah well "those should be good albums"
sw3087B-ms98-a-0033 120.681500 122.812375 [noise] "yes yeah so"
sw3087B-ms98-a-0055 244.307500 254.962500 so if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the US um you should go see it because it's really "it's really outstanding"
sw3090A-ms98-a-0083 349.941500 360.717125 "oh wow well my my husband and i" just were there last year um actually we didn't take a tour we we were in England and and uh went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and and did it on our own but
sw3091B-ms98-a-0090 383.761750 394.345125 yeah they have excellent lasagna and if you get like spaghetti with uh "get with the Italian sausage it taste like home made Italian sausage you'd get in Chicago"
sw3092A-ms98-a-0009 62.058625 67.657125 "in his benefits like uh" perhaps uh he has uh
sw3092B-ms98-a-0054 288.144000 290.265750 "right now like my"
sw3092B-ms98-a-0065 332.960000 336.921000 "now i i would like to see {bettle/better}" better dental insurance
sw3093A-ms98-a-0008 53.647625 62.655625 one year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado "into Durango and north of the area there" and uh
sw3093A-ms98-a-0018 154.437625 158.249750 "right and the beach is nice" the beach is really nice isn't it
sw3093A-ms98-a-0059 368.559500 370.598750 "two month break"
sw3093B-ms98-a-0028 123.117000 129.332375 before i moved out here we were closer and uh used to [vocalized-noise] "go almost"
sw3093B-ms98-a-0047 215.632125 230.082250 and it's uh called that because it's at the very end of uh a jetty there which is "uh sort of the end of this little little point and uh" it's a at the very end it's the last set of condominiums there and it's uh
sw3093B-ms98-a-0070 351.264875 354.380000 "uh what does what does that mean alternate"
sw3095A-ms98-a-0037 231.619625 233.575875 "isn't that terrible"
sw3095A-ms98-a-0072 418.939375 426.801000 and we couldn't we just dismissed the case you know "and and she" was uh taken care of by the proper
sw3095B-ms98-a-0006 39.360375 53.498125 people get together the different backgrounds "different ideas that" sometimes you can have one person or two that can hold up what i consider the proper sentencing of the p[erson]- person
sw3095B-ms98-a-0007 53.498125 55.408375 "yes ma'am"
sw3095B-ms98-a-0023 232.521875 243.399000 "and uh that's not the idea it's the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime" that he committed but to punish him for the crime he committed
sw3095B-ms98-a-0030 280.400750 290.824875 it'd get to the she was sentenced to jail "but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail" within eighteen months after she was sentenced
sw3095B-ms98-a-0042 368.369750 379.269250 overboard "to uh protect persons from being having their civil rights" violated to the point where the person that is damaged is not
sw3095B-ms98-a-0055 438.332250 442.210500 "which uh or should never have gone to court"
sw3097A-ms98-a-0006 23.767125 28.219375 "society has changed" everything has changed yeah yeah
sw3097A-ms98-a-0025 109.739875 120.813500 right and that will come i know that day will come and i am looking forward to that too but that's a different phase in my life "and i am i am glad that i am" able to do what i want to do right now
sw3097A-ms98-a-0071 287.953750 297.319625 it's just i do not know only time will tell whether it's better or worse "than the way we grew up but uh" it's it's just very different um
sw3097B-ms98-a-0044 125.332750 132.422250 "it's it's like the it's like oil on top of water it changes but it's never different" in a lot of ways
sw3099B-ms98-a-0003 8.188125 12.020125 okay do you ha[ve]- "but you have friends that have children"
sw3100B-ms98-a-0029 232.569875 244.413875 yeah that is one of the options but "uh that is so related to" the family situation of the children and
sw3100B-ms98-a-0031 256.290250 268.343875 and i would say well at this point um "you could say been through all that because i have no" no grandparents left uh and it's
sw3100B-ms98-a-0049 391.747125 401.873500 "yeah but the way society changes it makes it so that" uh what was acceptable for our parents and their parents
sw3102A-ms98-a-0016 73.954375 83.406125 i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in "and then you know find a school that's good for that"
sw3103A-ms98-a-0012 52.280500 53.756625 "right"
sw3103A-ms98-a-0031 136.922875 138.707750 "challenges"
sw3103A-ms98-a-0044 193.136750 201.340625 "and uh i think things are changing" but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to
sw3103A-ms98-a-0046 207.569625 211.224000 "so that's the main point is that we are going ahead"
sw3103A-ms98-a-0053 255.860750 261.730000 and they know that they can uh "you know uh" be on the same level
sw3103B-ms98-a-0007 43.850125 45.669625 "uh"

sw3104B-ms98-a-0060 432.031000 433.671500 "oh yeah"
sw3105A-ms98-a-0034 178.934500 180.233125 "right"
sw3105B-ms98-a-0017 73.165375 85.093625 is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws "protect the criminal they're the ones with the rights"
sw3105B-ms98-a-0063 326.641375 337.044625 that was what they had told "their teachers and so that's what they did" and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely
sw3107A-ms98-a-0036 275.577125 277.428750 "that's reasonable i think"
sw3107B-ms98-a-0003 18.188375 32.007125 "changes as uh" as percep[tion]- my perception changes of of what uh i'm getting gypped on [laughter] this week or this month uh uh
sw3107B-ms98-a-0004 32.007125 46.812000 uh we're just uh going through uh uh well there's a couple of changes to the to the uh "our health plan and uh" and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh
sw3108A-ms98-a-0014 62.518000 67.142000 i know "we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever" [laughter]
sw3108A-ms98-a-0028 115.814625 124.638250 "we will rent two or three movies on Thursday" and uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good
sw3108B-ms98-a-0003 7.043250 16.214875 "well don't bother" [laughter] well oh from a woman's point of view and it was very uh
sw3108B-ms98-a-0057 206.942250 214.250875 "okay let me think" if i have rented that one Harrison Ford and how does the story line go
sw3108B-ms98-a-0057 206.942250 214.250875 okay let me think if i have rented that one "Harrison Ford and" how does the story line go
sw3109A-ms98-a-0040 138.179250 146.258875 a seventy eight Chevy wagon and then a "a four year old uh Crown Victoria that i love and"
sw3109A-ms98-a-0057 234.197000 244.230875 sleek i guess for wind resistance you know and and uh they just don't look like they're roomy inside i guess they are i haven't been "looking at them to"
sw3109A-ms98-a-0086 343.242000 347.299625 [laughter] "[laughter-they] [laughter-must]" [laughter-because_1] [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-know] [laughter-where] [laughter-they're] [laughter-going]
sw3109A-ms98-a-0104 440.920625 444.716875 "well i- i don't know" [laughter] we
sw3110B-ms98-a-0007 25.000250 31.028125 you know so it's pretty important to "um" i also like very much the new split skirts
sw3110B-ms98-a-0136 463.570875 466.087375 "um" is when the kids get
sw3111A-ms98-a-0005 10.937750 15.768500 "because it's a situation it is very location dependent"
sw3111A-ms98-a-0015 68.691500 80.928750 you know the suburb i'm in is more of the upper middle class so i think our uh not that we don't have a certain amount of local "problems" but on the other hand
sw3111A-ms98-a-0018 88.509500 94.972875 "uh the main crimes" within the suburb here are the the theft crimes
sw3111A-ms98-a-0028 141.630750 143.860000 "wherever there are more"
sw3111A-ms98-a-0051 267.333375 279.697875 some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say you know back then there were the opium dens "but the thing is if somebody ruined their life"
sw3111A-ms98-a-0055 288.036000 295.506875 uh "become" well die or whatever i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that
sw3111A-ms98-a-0075 415.682750 420.854750 "well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable"
sw3111B-ms98-a-0083 323.992625 328.578000 "that that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana"
sw3111B-ms98-a-0111 459.294500 466.051250 "that that was an awful three years afterwards" you know of recovery and the difficulties
sw3112A-ms98-a-0013 147.988250 156.198500 my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um "even as a child i got to go"
sw3112A-ms98-a-0021 199.460875 208.656875 and when my father lived with us um i made more of an effort to learn but um "that's something that i"
sw3112A-ms98-a-0023 213.290375 219.907625 son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school "but this was the first year"
sw3113A-ms98-a-0012 102.310875 111.935250 uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how "heinous was the crime"
sw3113A-ms98-a-0016 125.376125 129.597625 "and so how do you relate as to whether this"
sw3113A-ms98-a-0047 332.764250 344.733750 "juries" only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if it's first degree rape second deg[ree]- degree rape or whatever
sw3113A-ms98-a-0056 413.151625 422.378875 yeah and "the truth that's brought out is" uh as i say when i've heard about you know the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
sw3113B-ms98-a-0020 197.818625 204.838750 has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically "or"
sw3113B-ms98-a-0021 204.838750 209.850750 "whatever the case may be and" sometimes that's not real fair either though so
sw3114B-ms98-a-0006 34.512250 39.840375 "uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say [noise]"
sw3114B-ms98-a-0008 46.282000 50.557750 to go back and pick up that gun "so that they can check them out"
sw3115A-ms98-a-0045 186.475625 196.860000 "and i don't know you know i i think about well" the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties
sw3115A-ms98-a-0046 196.860000 202.901750 "and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear" uh
sw3115A-ms98-a-0047 202.901750 213.927875 dress up jeans not sloppy looking "jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and" uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top and and uh
sw3115A-ms98-a-0058 262.707125 264.078125 "right"
sw3115A-ms98-a-0064 295.033125 302.962625 right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach "health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so" [laughter]

sw3115A-ms98-a-0092 440.046875 445.356125 "and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do"
sw3115B-ms98-a-0005 18.495375 20.523875 "oh okay"
sw3115B-ms98-a-0016 73.530625 78.064000 "you know you try to layer so you can add or or" or take off

sw3117A-ms98-a-0083 386.398750 399.000750 yeah well they're just so it's just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know they're they still talk about Mister Jefferson the you know i mean the founder of the school of course was Mister Jeffer[son]- "Thomas Jefferson and they" and and a lot of
sw3118A-ms98-a-0017 107.756500 115.775250 "and they have to stay in until they all agree" [noise] yeah i don't know i'm not sure if they go i mean to twelve new people

sw3121B-ms98-a-0043 272.508500 277.592375 "but now out here in Texas where i am now that's very unusual"
sw3121B-ms98-a-0052 337.993250 348.819625 well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into "the work force and in their twenties"

sw3133A-ms98-a-0050 217.794375 220.920125 "that's true maybe that's a way"
sw3133B-ms98-a-0011 24.472625 33.833000 for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves i think it's uh would every[one]- "everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about"
sw3133B-ms98-a-0060 334.083750 337.124875 "that's probably true that's probably true"
sw3133B-ms98-a-0072 388.170250 393.711375 e[ven]- "even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference" in their attitudes

sw3134B-ms98-a-0014 88.190250 100.818625 "the home is the key" i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um tha[t]- the main goal is making money now
sw3134B-ms98-a-0023 152.372625 157.595500 "uh how can they concentrate on schooling" i agree with you i think that's the main problem
sw3134B-ms98-a-0038 276.935250 287.801750 able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them "that's no good"
sw3135A-ms98-a-0041 218.751125 229.401500 "well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an" elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money

sw3137B-ms98-a-0091 431.863000 440.113500 but he doesn't seem to be bothered with them "you know he's real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he's he's not too bad"
sw3141A-ms98-a-0002 2.533500 12.798500 "one very old fat cat" [laughter] Prissy and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house [laughter]

sw3149B-ms98-a-0023 104.930250 106.822250 "it's so scary"
sw3150A-ms98-a-0044 319.379250 331.888375 and it really isn't for some people tha[t]- who have been there uh for over and over and over it really isn't uh as ba[d]- i mean there it's not that bad of a life as it should be "for the punishment aspect"
sw3150B-ms98-a-0005 7.820500 10.126125 "oh i'm pretty much for it"
sw3151A-ms98-a-0054 224.657625 230.426250 that person plus anybody in danger should should "b[e]- know about it and be aware of it"
sw3151A-ms98-a-0092 356.331750 358.573875 oh "i'll be darn"

sw3152A-ms98-a-0094 440.626250 444.136250 "and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning"

sw3403B-ms98-a-0050 273.395125 284.840250 "and uh" only uh Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because_1 he didn't want the son gettin[g]- too nervous about this whole thing game is a game you know well the Rangers
sw3404A-ms98-a-0029 199.128500 212.738125 so i like something that's kind of quick and and i love i like doing the samplers i have a whole wall of them and he'll just take this sampler which is just you know mediocre not so great and when he puts the colors he picks out "little bits of"
sw3405A-ms98-a-0021 124.237750 130.581750 "actually i have nine acres [laughter]" and uh for many years i grew sweet corn
sw3405A-ms98-a-0025 150.175000 161.588375 so we had a nice thing going there and it was delicious [laughter] "i really enjoyed that" and then i also have a a garden oh it's probably uh
sw3405A-ms98-a-0029 181.083750 188.525875 "all those good things and" i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer
sw3406A-ms98-a-0002 1.370750 6.892625 "so what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution"
sw3406A-ms98-a-0015 77.063750 84.540875 it's a very clean uh "fire extinguisher but it's you know really" bad on the environment
sw3406A-ms98-a-0032 143.203375 147.012250 "would uh pass the inspection a seventy six and"
sw3406B-ms98-a-0045 260.632250 262.456750 "i really think that um"
sw3407B-ms98-a-0017 70.494000 75.025000 i yeah "i think that's" a a good thing i[n]-
sw3408A-ms98-a-0025 90.298625 93.817500 my advice is "is uh"
sw3408A-ms98-a-0027 97.472875 104.004500 you know if you're gonna go to a college where student faculty ratio is "three and four hundred to one"
sw3408A-ms98-a-0044 169.006750 182.805750 you know you got a computerized test scores with multiple choice because there's no way "they could correct a three hundred fifty point" short answer test or you know a three hundred and three hundred and fifty person short answer test
sw3408A-ms98-a-0058 256.933875 259.451625 "that's excellent advice"
sw3410B-ms98-a-0002 0.069500 6.148750 "okay what do you feel are everyday occurrences that are invasion of privacy in your opinion"
sw3411A-ms98-a-0068 265.138875 267.857500 uh "well i've always been a Ford man myself"
sw3411A-ms98-a-0071 284.220000 293.583750 and uh my Ford trucks have just "i've i've just never had problems with them_1 i honestly think i would die before my truck would" kill over on me
sw3411B-ms98-a-0040 189.360125 191.152250 "um-hum yeah"
sw3411B-ms98-a-0052 239.922500 242.503125 um-hum there "that's true"
sw3413B-ms98-a-0013 65.750375 76.979250 income tax but then you pay [laughter] ten fifteen percent taxes "um you know i know they say it's only eight and a quarter or whatever it is but uh" but yeah i really think that it's it's way too much
sw3413B-ms98-a-0021 120.260000 132.276875 "city and in the things such as uh you know separating out your glass and your paper now" and and uh having the great big you know gallon drums uh uh keeping Plano beautiful and and i think that they really do a good job at it too
sw3415B-ms98-a-0071 235.240500 246.822125 yeah but see these people i know they keep them_1 up underneath their pillows a[nd]- "you know sitting right on top of their dresser drawers i mean" it's no wonder you know the kids get in there and then they blow uh other people away so you know

sw3417A-ms98-a-0007 15.244875 18.905375 "among industrialized nations" we have one of the
sw3417A-ms98-a-0018 96.382500 104.116625 that is a "particularly regressive tax" uh it's a tax on the first dollar earnings
sw3417A-ms98-a-0024 139.359000 140.805500 "oh yes"

sw3420A-ms98-a-0035 221.755000 229.585875 your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have "another child use that bed" you know but i'm sure that um

sw3424A-ms98-a-0039 172.195875 179.047625 i think i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest "and i think as as parents"
sw3424B-ms98-a-0046 191.024375 204.483375 and a brother who has a "new marriage and a younger son" but my brother and his wife live in Nevada my daughter lives in Colorado one of my nephews lives in New York City one nephew lives in Memphis

sw3906A-ms98-a-0005 18.533375 24.587500 "that's what my i don't know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price"
sw3906A-ms98-a-0023 132.593500 141.837500 y[ou]- you know that we don't really see or notice i guess "but it just seemed like if if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system"
sw3907A-ms98-a-0020 119.986125 131.548875 that that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with insects particularly caterpillars um "we've had very very poor luck with uh all of the core crops and like um uh"
sw3908B-ms98-a-0024 175.776250 188.653000 and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at [vocalized-noise] mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing isn't all it's cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think we'll probably see this [swind/swing] "pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit"
sw3910B-ms98-a-0003 1.695750 9.230750 well uh i "i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it"
sw3910B-ms98-a-0062 288.644375 300.546000 it's funny that uh "i guess all that started in England i guess all the" m[easurement]- system of measurement and now uh we're still using it and they are gone they've left it you [laughter-know] they use metrics there
sw3911A-ms98-a-0012 56.969250 67.005000 "no when my son was at home i i did work" and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about uh five other kids that she baby sat
sw3911B-ms98-a-0049 270.954000 282.708625 "so uh" we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother i'll have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still we'll share that job
sw3913B-ms98-a-0025 111.784125 116.312500 "but it's a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it"
sw3914B-ms98-a-0043 246.090000 256.842125 "you know always you know my kids smarter they know about [laughter-guns]" it won't happen to them it may not happen to their kid but it'll happen to the neighbor who doesn't understand it and happens to come by and visit [noise]
sw3917A-ms98-a-0040 183.982250 189.121125 so that's i think that's good to keep the "equal as far as"
sw3917A-ms98-a-0062 295.275125 298.946000 "and um" [noise] other tha[n]- uh we really
sw3917B-ms98-a-0007 18.540250 28.830125 i'm not "that liberated i mean my mom's kind of old fashioned you know so" i you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff but um i think it's
sw3917B-ms98-a-0056 214.552000 224.279500 "exactly i i see more men um" like participating in like the family things with children like you know helping to take care of them_1 more and
sw3917B-ms98-a-0062 244.236250 246.832250 "oh yeah i agree with that"
sw3921B-ms98-a-0009 15.363625 19.026000 "well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods"
sw3921B-ms98-a-0029 116.871250 120.317125 "get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while"
sw3921B-ms98-a-0035 136.886125 149.413375 and you're right i mean i like to fish for trout "and they are really uh" uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu
sw3921B-ms98-a-0066 270.005000 278.751875 "uh yeah most of the time uh" we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
sw3923B-ms98-a-0027 154.976750 163.602250 is that right "well here yeah e[ven]- even uh even just putting uh little uh uh patio outside you have" to have a permit
sw3925A-ms98-a-0051 209.991125 219.465375 uh at uh "it's TCJC Tex[as]-" Tarrant County Junior College yeah and it's really it's really enjoyable i like it

sw3926A-ms98-a-0014 94.001875 100.837250 i hadn't uh thought of it from that point of view before i have been in "a fairly important trial"
sw3930B-ms98-a-0011 97.484000 101.024750 "no i think that's very very very wrong"
sw3934B-ms98-a-0004 16.795750 25.143625 yeah well we [vocalized-noise] we "we got on it um a long time ago but then it was down so much of the time" you kind of got out of the out of the habit
sw3934B-ms98-a-0044 177.699250 185.635500 "well if you had a hundred bucks and you couldn't do anything except spend them on magazines what magazines would you would you g[et]-" would you would you buy
sw3935B-ms98-a-0009 45.896250 48.449000 "very long ago it wasn't"

sw3943B-ms98-a-0047 292.032125 299.458000 uh "[vocalized-noise] justified you know or brought up" to whatever over the state salary level uh
sw3944B-ms98-a-0003 4.871750 14.775750 "well i like them_1 because i can read them at my convenience" and i don't like a lot of the ads i get in them_1 especially those stupid cards that fall out of them all the time
sw3944B-ms98-a-0021 139.286125 146.434125 my husband likes "to read" sports and fishing magazines all the time that's pretty boring to me [laughter]
sw3945A-ms98-a-0010 66.357500 77.888375 uh but i also know that people to me won't do what they should do to help each other "and they wouldn't have so much government if we did"
sw3946A-ms98-a-0067 244.511750 247.203375 "it's kind of hard" [laughter]
sw3950B-ms98-a-0014 46.879250 56.095250 you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that it's much easier for me than for let's "say"

sw3956B-ms98-a-0026 158.353625 170.659125 of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh "compensation but of course that is restricted choice so"
sw3957B-ms98-a-0022 158.038000 163.151250 you know i "think there needs to be more severe punishment" but it needs to be fair

sw3966B-ms98-a-0011 54.343125 63.506375 "i really don't feel that but i do feel tougher laws" but some way i feel they have to uh revise our criminal system
sw3966B-ms98-a-0014 78.570750 86.223625 but any way back to capital punishment i do believe in it for murderers "and and especially um"

sw3998B-ms98-a-0014 36.541250 42.051500 i guess my biggest problem is that uh they seem to "uh be"
sw4000B-ms98-a-0043 282.512750 287.624875 "and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder"

sw4004A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.158000 [noise] "so how do you feel about the Vietnam War"

sw4011A-ms98-a-0023 118.525750 131.216375 "um do you think uh do you think that that uh" the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution
sw4011A-ms98-a-0028 162.827250 174.677000 um well to be honest i think that the uh "capital punishment is is is a uh red herring" in the crime and punishment business
sw4011A-ms98-a-0032 199.875500 209.332750 run the beat [noise] so in this "heated air of mistrust" people don't do what's necessary
sw4011A-ms98-a-0041 251.416875 265.070500 yeah exactly you know John John Singleton who's who uh made the film um [noise] "Boys in the Hood" noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men
sw4012B-ms98-a-0018 47.043875 49.483750 "i think there are certain"

sw4013A-ms98-a-0008 32.765875 40.225125 with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation "well that's fun so" um
sw4013A-ms98-a-0009 40.225125 48.412875 "let's see" uh some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and

sw4014A-ms98-a-0019 93.661625 108.520125 oh i mean i don['t]- i i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that it's hard to justify being "i don't understand how our government can can encourage drug testing" and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like they're testing the same sort of nebulous
sw4016A-ms98-a-0028 115.505500 126.493250 we can't do that so [laughter] um we like to "uh rent videos and" sit down and have a video bash pop popcorn and

sw4030B-ms98-a-0050 225.031250 230.684875 i uh felt that was displayed in terms of "of uh Iraq in particular"
sw4030B-ms98-a-0051 230.684875 236.658000 "was that it seemed to me that George Bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that"

sw4036A-ms98-a-0042 136.438125 146.880500 "you know maybe is a problem is uh" i- i- i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
sw4036A-ms98-a-0060 231.248500 240.849375 if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um "you know issue is under discussion"

sw4058A-ms98-a-0042 199.683375 214.481875 there are people that are going to make sure that every T is crossed every I is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality "now"
sw4058A-ms98-a-0047 241.171625 252.025625 in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened "um"
sw4059A-ms98-a-0028 86.341625 90.472625 that uh [noise] "yeah they may say it's real bad"
sw4060A-ms98-a-0057 212.980625 216.769125 "uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution"
sw4060A-ms98-a-0072 273.340625 275.740875 "yeah you end up being your own person"

sw4063B-ms98-a-0045 244.475750 249.863000 "but it is hard i don't know in in compared to say my mother and father"
sw4064A-ms98-a-0014 59.513250 69.788250 you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the de[cision]- making a decision "and second of all you get a wide variety of" background so that
sw4064A-ms98-a-0036 171.087375 174.506500 "i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in"
sw4064B-ms98-a-0018 77.359750 84.654375 uh too often i think they're not "and uh" when you y[ou]- when you are
sw4064B-ms98-a-0020 94.278875 104.152875 "you know that's a matter of concern to me too" uh i think that uh in such cases uh
sw4064B-ms98-a-0038 208.924000 211.316750 "isn't that the truth" [laughter]
sw4064B-ms98-a-0039 211.316750 214.655500 [noise] "there are times when is it uh"
sw4064B-ms98-a-0040 214.655500 219.192125 "oh goodness my mind's gone blank it uh Othello"
sw4065B-ms98-a-0003 15.073500 24.571875 you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who's impor[tant]- "whose decisions are important and [vocalized-noise] you know" that's
sw4065B-ms98-a-0004 24.571875 30.675375 that's what i think as far as you are required to not only "be" at work when you're not at work
sw4067A-ms98-a-0040 229.356625 242.191375 "yeah my uh" my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh she's uh Alzheimer's i guess
sw4068B-ms98-a-0019 116.135250 127.666750 well "uh i probably" tend to fa[ll]- come down on the side of of being for it but i- i think it
sw4069B-ms98-a-0014 64.772250 68.544625 yeah yeah because_1 "by the time and you save them_1 and squish them_1 and"
sw4070B-ms98-a-0002 35.872625 43.258125 well let's see uh "yeah i think taxes are high but uh"
sw4071A-ms98-a-0012 43.141000 53.468500 booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax "bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling"
sw4071A-ms98-a-0013 53.468500 64.504000 "so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh" generally do pay in too too much in taxes [vocalized-noise]
sw4071A-ms98-a-0024 99.186000 111.365125 "uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money" to Washington or to the state and they say they're going to send some back it's like giving yourself a tra[nsfusion]- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
sw4071A-ms98-a-0042 203.547875 211.683625 "uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't h[ave]- owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had"
sw4071A-ms98-a-0048 245.076000 258.387625 [noise] i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays "four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes"
sw4071A-ms98-a-0061 285.550250 299.170000 you're like you're like my daughter who's in in college down in Massachusetts and uh "she works as a waitress and she's attending college full time also and she sends her" taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and
sw4071B-ms98-a-0020 96.632750 98.071375 "no"
sw4072A-ms98-a-0051 221.147000 223.255500 "it's just gotten so i mean"
sw4074A-ms98-a-0033 125.768875 131.572125 "it's pretty good training i think" i mean it it keeps us on our toes [laughter]
sw4074B-ms98-a-0016 50.562875 59.499500 he he's ye[ah]- we bought the cat for him and so he's he's been "the one that you know spent the most time with him"
sw4074B-ms98-a-0047 165.064125 168.367375 "and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs"
sw4074B-ms98-a-0056 181.935875 185.670750 no "no it's just uh"
sw4074B-ms98-a-0064 223.567500 231.305500 "when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and" and it was a dog that we gotten
sw4074B-ms98-a-0067 250.109875 263.532875 "so we gave him to uh i don't know if you've" there's a place out here on it's called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville and they have um
sw4076B-ms98-a-0042 143.152625 156.507250 "but [laughter-uh]" it just it seems to work pretty well in most cases then some cases like the Manuel Noriega trial i don't see how they could have found anybody in the country who didn't have some opinion on that case
sw4077B-ms98-a-0035 164.284500 167.852125 i don't know if Dallas is in the top three but "oh do you own a gun"
sw4077B-ms98-a-0067 292.624625 294.006500 "that kind of"
sw4078B-ms98-a-0050 270.416875 280.862875 i'm not as good about searching something out like that "but if i'm there and the choice is there" i would probably take the recycled product
sw4079A-ms98-a-0010 54.287000 60.926250 "um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well" and uh
sw4079A-ms98-a-0024 154.499625 160.452000 so i kind of have uh "an amount in my mind and i'm" making every effort to
sw4079A-ms98-a-0044 232.780000 245.631500 you know typically you [vocalized-noise] if you purchase your own car you tend to make "uh the best returns after you pay it off" of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
sw4080A-ms98-a-0026 71.739250 75.005750 and "you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now"
sw4080A-ms98-a-0055 160.197875 168.202125 they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws a here while back "in some states in terms of a waiting" period
sw4080B-ms98-a-0028 83.535625 84.647000 "sure"

sw4082B-ms98-a-0009 64.258125 70.124375 [noise] well it's similar to that but it's Dow Jones "which is um The Wall Street Journal's news wire"
sw4082B-ms98-a-0028 200.481625 214.491625 [noise] i- i think both uh by deliberate um [vocalized-noise] i mean mist[akes]- mistakes of omission or uh [noise] or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal "view point that they have"
sw4084B-ms98-a-0050 253.144750 260.722500 "well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of"
sw4086A-ms98-a-0034 148.420875 158.524500 "and that opens up a whole -[a]nother can of worms" i guess Ford is suppose to start out with they're gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in California
sw4086A-ms98-a-0068 234.547125 237.470125 "yeah i've heard some good things about that car" actually
sw4090A-ms98-a-0020 85.858375 94.321875 and then um we don't have a lot ex[tra]- "extra for extra spending" [laughter] so it's pretty well [laughter] earmarked
sw4090A-ms98-a-0033 160.615750 162.288125 "yeah"
sw4090A-ms98-a-0038 183.941125 188.981125 huh and also we have found that if we "write down"
sw4090A-ms98-a-0060 270.726625 272.310625 oh "uh-huh"
sw4090B-ms98-a-0007 21.796125 27.483500 are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every "every month and"
sw4090B-ms98-a-0054 261.320250 272.767875 "we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt" uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card
sw4092B-ms98-a-0080 243.916875 248.422125 uh-huh "yuck looking i mean" ugh um
sw4094B-ms98-a-0006 17.203750 18.501375 "[laughter-right]"
sw4094B-ms98-a-0008 21.545750 24.945250 "yes i i really think that um"
sw4094B-ms98-a-0042 219.893625 224.161500 "so i- i- i think that it could go even farther than"
sw4094B-ms98-a-0054 266.251125 274.376375 and so why should we pardon something that we don't believe our our Lo[rd]- uh God "is pardoning do you know what i mean"
sw4095B-ms98-a-0088 264.276750 274.258875 um "not really my uh my parents are divorced and my father uh is dating a woman who has a two year old boy" and uh
sw4096A-ms98-a-0025 113.099125 119.903875 yeah we're doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here "there's uh"
sw4096A-ms98-a-0026 119.903875 123.500875 "we've actually got" a kind of a nice set up we've got a
sw4096A-ms98-a-0028 127.880625 132.826625 "and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not"
sw4096A-ms98-a-0038 199.340500 204.692750 "and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama"
sw4096A-ms98-a-0041 217.981875 225.906750 "how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill"
sw4098B-ms98-a-0008 16.221625 18.094875 "you pay too much"
sw4098B-ms98-a-0065 268.296250 279.866750 um certainly it it depends i mean here you in New Jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax "sort of value added tax on your utilities"
sw4099A-ms98-a-0019 57.591000 62.535250 oh "and this is a club or uh do you belong to a" group
sw4099A-ms98-a-0039 117.265875 124.808125 uh i really don't have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and "that's what i do everyday"
sw4099B-ms98-a-0023 92.294500 106.968875 and since i am not a tennis player um you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties "so um" there aren't many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers
sw4099B-ms98-a-0061 249.142125 250.843125 "you've never heard of that"
sw4100A-ms98-a-0013 74.805375 79.670500 and the result is a lot of people "won't provide it at all or" over charge
sw4100A-ms98-a-0037 260.132000 269.574250 and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else "and a lot of things like that"
sw4101A-ms98-a-0006 29.891875 41.611375 [noise] any of the recycled products uh we're in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people [noise] uh [noise] "there are areas where we could uh" [noise] actually we have a couple of the uh
sw4101A-ms98-a-0007 41.611375 47.269000 handicapped societies type of "places where they uh" [noise]
sw4101A-ms98-a-0014 93.026375 103.748375 [noise] and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers "uh we do have"
sw4101A-ms98-a-0030 231.500250 243.644000 we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on "[welfor/welfare] welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing" [noise] um
sw4101B-ms98-a-0004 85.567375 88.570500 "but the deposits only on like drink stuff"
sw4101B-ms98-a-0007 92.612125 93.848000 "okay"
sw4103A-ms98-a-0057 210.376125 218.911875 uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by "uh reading Telecom Digest or was there another"
sw4103A-ms98-a-0059 229.086875 232.974250 "oh okay yeah that's how i got it as well but uh"
sw4103B-ms98-a-0009 52.199750 57.451750 "have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we"
sw4103B-ms98-a-0020 109.984500 119.658000 we're to the point now where our financial "income is enough that we can consider" putting some away for college so
sw4103B-ms98-a-0030 167.110125 170.800000 "took on a full time job well almost full time"
sw4104A-ms98-a-0003 3.667875 11.351750 "what do i do um at the moment it's utter chaos" [laughter] um
sw4104A-ms98-a-0056 276.335500 278.516000 "the um"
sw4105A-ms98-a-0003 30.955375 43.533625 "that's true unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different branches" uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that
sw4106B-ms98-a-0037 207.517125 209.915000 "yeah exactly and"
sw4107A-ms98-a-0005 8.612375 11.746125 you have to [noise] "it's a law i think that organizations"
sw4107A-ms98-a-0023 118.443625 120.543750 "no not really i mean"
sw4107A-ms98-a-0031 169.230625 177.957375 um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the streets even would would um "make people do it"
sw4107A-ms98-a-0039 208.756500 214.686125 [laughter-yeah] i'm sure they will i mean with uh "the way things are going i mean uh it's going towards a more green"
sw4107A-ms98-a-0059 278.737000 284.967750 and they "i believe they give discounts o[n]- on drinks if you have this cup" so that's kind of incentive
sw4108A-ms98-a-0017 58.444375 63.151000 that's true until they get over that hump "of whatever it is they're" dealing with
sw4108A-ms98-a-0044 161.615625 163.222625 [noise] "yeah that they're"
sw4108B-ms98-a-0008 42.542125 51.050625 "um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness"
sw4108B-ms98-a-0025 147.808375 153.691750 "[noise] i know some el[derly]- unfortunately some elderly have to go to or [noise]" have
sw4108B-ms98-a-0034 218.784875 224.511500 gives her a little bit of her own independence but "she still has uh" a security there
sw4109A-ms98-a-0014 56.198375 66.627250 and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay "and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market we'd have uh"
sw4110B-ms98-a-0014 71.788125 76.374500 uh a tent of some sort but they're really expensive like "the good ones"
sw4110B-ms98-a-0032 148.463250 160.846750 and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a "it was late summer but it get it go[t]- it got" really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to
sw4113A-ms98-a-0026 83.412375 89.887500 and that you know you can't just send someone off to Washington "and expect you know his first day to be an effective"
sw4113B-ms98-a-0027 288.109125 299.618000 uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant "bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place" uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
sw4114A-ms98-a-0002 0.332250 2.393750 "so" how you like New Jersey
sw4114B-ms98-a-0008 33.881000 40.204875 "yeah you you go even a few" wi[de]- miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air
sw4114B-ms98-a-0012 59.007125 63.543875 "yeah going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair"
sw4114B-ms98-a-0022 129.429375 140.439625 "i mean the uh car air conditioners is" one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon which is one of the major fluor[ocarbons]- [chlorofar/chlorofluorocarbons] -[chloro]fluorocarbons
sw4114B-ms98-a-0022 129.429375 140.439625 i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources "of uh the uh freon" which is one of the major fluor[ocarbons]- [chlorofar/chlorofluorocarbons] -[chloro]fluorocarbons
sw4114B-ms98-a-0040 245.514625 259.083000 well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the with the inversion and Los Angeles and a[ll]- "rest of California which is just terrible it sounds"
sw4116A-ms98-a-0008 52.188875 61.162625 "a recourse if they say well it's it's do you have a" positive you know and you say well no that's not really true and they say well okay well here
sw4117A-ms98-a-0003 19.090500 28.804125 "belief that uh any" particular person's life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some
sw4117A-ms98-a-0016 158.558625 171.329125 "yeah actually see i'm i'm sort of uh" there are there are some other things i'm a[gainst]- i'm against also i thi[nk]- i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which i'm also against
sw4117A-ms98-a-0022 201.668625 212.027250 you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it's so uh [laughter] it's so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't "crazy already and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment"
sw4119A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 13.120125 [noise] so you don't oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh "trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost"
sw4119A-ms98-a-0009 101.170375 113.474000 but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent "if someone if someone knows that there's a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from" from whatever the drug is they're they're on
sw4119A-ms98-a-0019 232.692375 243.551375 "um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh Switzerland" opened up a um uh a park
sw4121B-ms98-a-0019 105.002375 118.926875 "it was really a lot hard harder to do it because_1 um" it's different depending on what town you're in basically every town is different which i think that that's crazy that it should be coordinated by the state or something but
sw4122B-ms98-a-0012 45.512250 49.294000 "uh no optical the dental is fully covered um"
sw4122B-ms98-a-0071 223.798500 226.359000 "uh full coverage for well mother care"
sw4123B-ms98-a-0017 71.305000 85.282125 as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope it's still you know hard to "say that what you've heard is what really is"
sw4124B-ms98-a-0012 73.105125 80.752250 "at a time when maybe i'd have uh the the uh freon checked in the air conditioner or maybe topped off"
sw4126A-ms98-a-0076 237.600625 239.813375 "yeah well maybe you can"
sw4127B-ms98-a-0037 169.300125 176.481250 you know i have my own little "cleaning business type thing so" um i keep
sw4127B-ms98-a-0040 190.538500 193.731375 "you know it's not that not that hard"
sw4127B-ms98-a-0047 206.001500 207.351250 "huh"
sw4127B-ms98-a-0050 212.424875 224.328000 mean "read the little book they send you" fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to
sw4130A-ms98-a-0015 69.690375 77.278625 you know becau[se]- because of of the audi[ence]- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were in "people that no one really cared about"
sw4130A-ms98-a-0016 77.278625 78.490500 "that"
sw4130B-ms98-a-0042 187.787375 196.481625 i don't know i don't know i I i don't know what the likelihood of that is there you know people really waking up "especially with the ultra conservative"
sw4131B-ms98-a-0055 294.556875 299.842000 well "the carburetion never really worked quite right and there"
sw4132B-ms98-a-0018 100.319250 113.146125 "and uh it's" amazing how these things work one of my most um am[azing]- amazing things is to me is that what appears to be the major part of the work basically putting the structure up happens very quickly
sw4137A-ms98-a-0008 42.184125 43.906500 "let's see"
sw4137A-ms98-a-0010 46.357000 52.305125 M X three "uh Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand"
sw4137A-ms98-a-0012 54.215875 67.001250 and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody "all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and" i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it
sw4137A-ms98-a-0023 92.499125 101.083875 "that it's fast but unreliable and" trying to get it prepared for racing but it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the go Saturn
sw4137A-ms98-a-0056 228.433000 237.276875 "and then you go to Porsche and it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade" and no two of them are alike
sw4137A-ms98-a-0062 252.821375 259.010500 yeah "yeah but it it BMW's good" for that what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
sw4137B-ms98-a-0004 12.625500 15.360250 "oh really you like uh so you're an American"
sw4137B-ms98-a-0031 158.308750 166.061500 something on that order i haven't really determined if i like the "the Japanese or the" if i like them enough to purchase one
sw4138A-ms98-a-0008 20.889500 28.568750 "during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but" they're running under the assump[tion]- you know
sw4138A-ms98-a-0009 28.568750 41.287625 the way they're running it now they're h[ave]- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter "the deficit that we're running so"
sw4138B-ms98-a-0005 58.403750 72.561125 well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and "police and fire department uh" you know they need to make a living
sw4138B-ms98-a-0028 259.025250 267.710125 yeah if you impl[emented]- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people "uh to make more money and the" what
sw4140A-ms98-a-0012 179.415125 192.498625 "oh i- i- i agree i" my point was that the police want to get rid rid of the people of of guns and what's happening is that i see i- i- i view this country as as as we have
sw4142B-ms98-a-0014 87.941500 97.841250 "and so" uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization
sw4142B-ms98-a-0017 113.098875 125.657375 square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and ju[st]- just showed that you know our "obvi[ous]- for some reason our property had been valued much higher"
sw4142B-ms98-a-0044 283.031875 286.825750 "yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and"
sw4143B-ms98-a-0014 76.279000 86.582125 "has had a uh a similar volunteer" program and they just got the Department of Public Works to do a uh
sw4144A-ms98-a-0040 199.900750 203.581125 "you know and and all these systems of where you can like"
sw4145A-ms98-a-0042 132.052000 140.869625 a lot of desperate people "whereas i think probably fifty years ago" the crime wasn't quite so intense that way [vocalized-noise]
sw4145A-ms98-a-0086 263.364875 274.249875 "let's see" i think with like with rape it's one out of three women and one out of ten men or boys rape the the amount of rape and uh
sw4145A-ms98-a-0086 263.364875 274.249875 let's see i think with like with rape it's one out of three women and one out of ten men or boys rape the the amount of rape "and uh"
sw4145A-ms98-a-0088 283.209000 290.358375 [noise] because that's where all the d[rug]- "the gangs get their power" over the drugs because it's illegal
sw4147A-ms98-a-0053 269.717375 278.620125 sure and that's all part of y[our]- of keeping your part of the relationship "you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh" those issues
sw4147B-ms98-a-0023 117.122875 123.905500 well i- i guess in one sense we felt that "it it's nice to have a dog"
sw4147B-ms98-a-0025 134.376125 143.749125 "it was an age where it was uh" we thought it was be good for them to have the [noise] discipline that goes with with having a pet uh
sw4147B-ms98-a-0038 194.465625 200.464375 "uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area"
sw4148A-ms98-a-0006 30.409500 43.843625 i don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because_1 i thought there were cases where uh i don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was "okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve"
sw4148A-ms98-a-0024 194.750125 199.267625 uh "liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt"
sw4148B-ms98-a-0010 109.541375 116.265000 that i mean i[t]- it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs "because um"
sw4149A-ms98-a-0012 71.746625 73.471125 "and um"
sw4149A-ms98-a-0018 127.036500 131.387000 it's "not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for"
sw4149A-ms98-a-0019 131.387000 140.166000 and uh then we have you know whatever's left over is disposable in[come]- "disposable" dis[posable]- yeah discretionary income
sw4149A-ms98-a-0055 268.794750 271.429250 "who's who's not very well educated"
sw4149B-ms98-a-0051 270.487250 277.823250 "the starving ones" there's enough out there that if you have if you're educated enough then you can make money
sw4150B-ms98-a-0039 197.667750 207.327500 "and" have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's
sw4151A-ms98-a-0019 175.147750 183.666750 "can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together or are they is it a penal"
sw4151B-ms98-a-0014 87.847500 98.568500 "oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that" versus an intelligent reason response
sw4151B-ms98-a-0016 108.518875 118.757000 "he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion"
sw4151B-ms98-a-0029 232.308875 244.561750 well i was about to kill and dismember this person but ooh if they catch me they're going to kill me so i better not do it "i i just don't" think that uh that it works that way
sw4152A-ms98-a-0026 156.687125 170.162000 "they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh" i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i- i rather imagine there's [noise] there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic
sw4152A-ms98-a-0039 214.591000 220.019750 "i don't know you know and and again there's something else th[at]-" you know there was a
sw4152B-ms98-a-0026 143.540625 146.518875 "how interesting ooh"
sw4152B-ms98-a-0035 192.498250 195.321875 "unfortunately that kind of thing is not"
sw4153A-ms98-a-0027 126.832375 138.820875 right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the "um three three year olds"
sw4153A-ms98-a-0042 217.008125 221.225000 "you know going through this routine" which is lousy
sw4153A-ms98-a-0048 251.553625 252.954125 "uh-huh"
sw4153B-ms98-a-0015 58.555500 63.449750 "because we had" [noise] we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in
sw4153B-ms98-a-0066 267.388000 273.381750 "they also did some of the teaching things" and then they had um
sw4154A-ms98-a-0032 98.805000 101.010625 "yeah but on the other hand you know if"
sw4154A-ms98-a-0055 166.966625 171.127125 "you know and that you know and for portraying Bush as a strong president"
sw4154A-ms98-a-0056 171.127125 174.327125 "um i mean i really i really think that that"
sw4154A-ms98-a-0073 217.623375 224.007625 i think i think it was it was "there were there were a lot more" demographic related interests involved than
sw4154A-ms98-a-0095 286.114375 289.907750 "well i have i have very mixed feelings about Israel um"
sw4154B-ms98-a-0010 39.616375 45.937750 and then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much or "supplied with arms the same way"
sw4154B-ms98-a-0015 66.235625 77.098250 overall tend to support them_1 but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh "Kuwait was uh"
sw4154B-ms98-a-0046 228.416500 232.812125 "yeah well may have been you know i'm not saying that that's not the case uh"

sw4155B-ms98-a-0036 180.745250 188.911375 well let's see "they take out in state and" federal taxes i think i pay
sw4155B-ms98-a-0037 188.911375 191.454875 "forty two percent"
sw4155B-ms98-a-0042 211.349750 216.747625 "do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government"
sw4158A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.998000 [noise] "so um are you working right now"

sw4159B-ms98-a-0012 58.912125 70.040125 "that then really doesn't penali[ze]-" wind up penalizing the person that they went after who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us
sw4159B-ms98-a-0028 190.632375 196.948625 i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that "that did the damage"
sw4159B-ms98-a-0039 264.705875 271.765250 "and unfortunately the j[ury]-" the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too

sw4165B-ms98-a-0002 8.965250 22.255875 well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care "our kids are now fourteen and eighteen" but uh [noise] and so you know you go back
sw4165B-ms98-a-0017 164.666875 171.756875 "in one sense two forms" of uh child care there's where individuals will
sw4165B-ms98-a-0020 193.192250 198.765250 frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care "and"
sw4165B-ms98-a-0021 198.765250 211.719750 [noise] the emphasis is "primarily" uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time there's some fairly good training programs
sw4165B-ms98-a-0023 215.512000 223.309125 "uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing"
sw4165B-ms98-a-0029 280.353375 289.800000 [noise] or in a larger situation where "actually it's more of an institution and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's not"

sw4166B-ms98-a-0017 121.574500 129.228375 "you know besides moving her up" which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work
sw4166B-ms98-a-0041 250.331875 253.387000 and it very "very hard for them to accept that"
sw4166B-ms98-a-0043 255.345750 259.317250 "we just uh moved my" grandfather into
sw4168A-ms98-a-0068 208.033250 209.967875 "yeah yeah"

sw4170B-ms98-a-0005 17.894125 30.006375 so i kind of feel like i'm supporting a lot of people and that it's just gonna go into a hole [laughter] "i don't think that i'm gonna get anything out of it when the time comes from"
sw4170B-ms98-a-0029 178.812500 191.387125 my you know i- i don't exactly appreciate that either i really get frustrated "when government starts to do things that are immoral and then" expect me to support them on it
sw4170B-ms98-a-0036 246.478750 255.946125 but on the other hand at least we're [noise] "we're powerless in a lot of ways but then" there's so many other countries that i'm glad i'm not in
sw4170B-ms98-a-0037 255.946125 270.049750 [noise] you know it seems to me like the minute you starting putting in any radical changes in anything "you end up with something like um Liberia or" [laughter] uh Czechoslovakia you know i mean it seems like
sw4171A-ms98-a-0013 35.515000 45.402000 [noise] "retirement they kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then" [noise] the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that

sw4174B-ms98-a-0019 130.510500 141.402125 smaller side where dormitory life "is uh is right on campus as well" and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit
sw4174B-ms98-a-0027 184.970500 198.840250 "achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates" can give you idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a

sw4175B-ms98-a-0069 206.831125 209.245125 "the great Satan of the recycling"
sw4175B-ms98-a-0088 252.551500 255.995125 but i can just forget that from "now on i'm going to use i'm going to switch to the white ones"
sw4177A-ms98-a-0018 71.181000 79.321625 "that come out which they the news isn't like" immediate what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material
sw4177A-ms98-a-0025 112.004875 117.485250 "it goes so slow and then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting"
sw4177A-ms98-a-0029 138.975250 147.152000 yeah i think they're about the same i you know they they certainly have a very similar "uh charter at least in my mind"
sw4177B-ms98-a-0030 159.913875 168.563625 you know with all the uh USSR's satellites breaking off and trying to become independent and then you know "European community coming together"
sw4177B-ms98-a-0046 221.865375 224.453500 "oh yeah so they have a toehold a good toehold"
sw4177B-ms98-a-0057 257.403625 265.049375 yeah i- i can understand their viewpoint they're just they're starting off and their economy's a little bit weak so they want to "get established before they"
sw4180B-ms98-a-0003 5.563750 11.364125 well it "it it's the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and"
sw4180B-ms98-a-0025 152.854625 166.567500 yeah so we're you know net "we're doing a net borrowing of four percent each year" and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt
sw4180B-ms98-a-0042 282.261000 286.269875 "but you know it's that that's a very large chunk of"
sw4181A-ms98-a-0008 26.187625 28.721875 "tax free or die" uh-huh
sw4181B-ms98-a-0011 26.950125 32.826500 "right" which is probably pretty nice but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
sw4184A-ms98-a-0052 186.494125 195.133750 yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them_1 "going it's not good to"
sw4184B-ms98-a-0015 84.928375 95.676500 and they just uh [vocalized-noise] i think they have a good head on their shoulders i think they have a a higher level of intelligence than "other uh dogs that i've encountered"
sw4311A-ms98-a-0009 46.994875 49.957125 [noise] "my second consideration would be uh"
sw4311A-ms98-a-0030 236.105750 243.056875 but they may have to work from age thirty or or forty to age "seventy or eighty or ninety"
sw4311B-ms98-a-0005 17.698625 21.496625 and uh "have some"
sw4312A-ms98-a-0027 159.869125 165.677375 and that "[laughter] that's about all he had going for him" or still has for that matter
sw4312B-ms98-a-0009 43.189375 50.642125 "oh i don't mind music that's [noise] difficult" to listen to but uh the the uh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0021 119.901250 133.757250 "i think it is uh" for a while there music seemed to really ha[ve]- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it i was really tired of uh
sw4312B-ms98-a-0044 252.119250 260.435500 and that's interesting music but it would not get performed by "any uh municipally funded"
sw4312B-ms98-a-0048 283.134000 290.936375 uh i feel that uh "that that music should take chances in one way or another"
sw4314A-ms98-a-0046 164.223500 175.081750 well actually i i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life um m[y]- my family's pretty into it "and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six and then uh" [noise]

sw4339A-ms98-a-0055 232.253625 242.280000 and uh "they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling" him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that'll

sw4340A-ms98-a-0049 246.952750 252.420250 "yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that" um are not premeditated

sw4348A-ms98-a-0035 217.937500 229.651500 i think inherently our the the chance that we're gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low "i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack" the United States

sw4352A-ms98-a-0018 117.069250 122.155875 you know be something that was rated fairly "good for reliability um"
sw4353A-ms98-a-0011 43.216875 55.725375 yeah i usually uh my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances "and of course we're the like ever[ybody]- like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month you know" and uh
sw4353A-ms98-a-0018 89.999625 102.782875 "um sort of on a peripheral she's an an[nuity]- an[nuity]- [annuitity/annuity] administrator" and so she uh she works for an insurance company but but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff and uh
sw4353A-ms98-a-0022 127.112750 135.260000 yeah and that that's kind of handy yeah "because_1 if you don't see it you don't miss" [laughter-it] [laughter-and] uh you don't spend it [laughter]
sw4353B-ms98-a-0004 10.448000 21.508375 "and we have um three" teenage daughters and you know they're very expensive so um [noise] uh we yeah we have somewhat of of a system um

sw4353B-ms98-a-0045 201.353625 211.549375 "you know i don't" ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have

sw4356B-ms98-a-0048 194.014500 201.139250 uh i've been real impressed with that "y[ou]- you and i didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car" now
sw4358A-ms98-a-0016 140.928875 155.612375 it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling "reusable materials back into uh" manufacturing
sw4358B-ms98-a-0018 228.940125 240.731125 usually have them come from [vocalized-noise] you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of "annual" [laughter]
sw4359A-ms98-a-0015 47.222125 54.060875 what types of things have you looked for when you're um when you were looking in f[or]- "to the child care there"
sw4360A-ms98-a-0022 75.616625 86.285375 "i don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out" for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
sw4360A-ms98-a-0042 141.975500 151.664875 and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most "in most places" for both parents to work

sw4362A-ms98-a-0010 93.689750 105.719000 so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system "and i recognize that there are good schools out there i mean" somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people
sw4362A-ms98-a-0021 221.497750 233.481000 and they both have like second jobs "that they work in the afternoons" they both work all summer full-time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each

sw4362B-ms98-a-0005 34.563250 46.107625 um however i if it weren't for our "needless uh" [noise] competition with Japan i i'd i'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace
sw4362B-ms98-a-0023 153.610125 166.314375 that things ought to get better so uh a[nd]- the other two a[ll]- oh they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in anyways "and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to"
sw4362B-ms98-a-0036 256.621750 268.567125 yeah w[ell]- w[ell]- well that's true but that "there's you can always play games with uh" talking about whoa look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong
sw4363A-ms98-a-0048 157.383000 161.614250 "right it can take over a small market share" but nothing really
sw4364A-ms98-a-0026 200.580750 207.589375 any of these the public uh stations "you know i- i- i- i think i sent in in money for"

sw4366B-ms98-a-0055 260.224625 262.268125 "i guess uh"
sw4366B-ms98-a-0058 267.635375 274.602250 "you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing if it it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals"
sw4366B-ms98-a-0061 288.124250 290.854250 "to the ability of the individual to pay"
sw4367B-ms98-a-0023 123.170000 125.442875 "um-hum sure sure"
sw4369B-ms98-a-0019 122.654000 135.510250 that "there's obviously racism in terms of" even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of crimes than they are represented in the overall population they are also c[onvicted]- convicted of capital crimes
sw4370A-ms98-a-0043 220.645250 223.544000 "oh is it oh i didn't realize that okay"
sw4370A-ms98-a-0050 243.433625 248.633250 "so you['re]- what you're saying is if if this is the second offense then you execute them_1"
sw4370A-ms98-a-0054 281.388250 287.042500 "what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets"
sw4370B-ms98-a-0019 107.101000 120.131750 "picking through them_1" whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutors sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
sw4370B-ms98-a-0021 127.390875 140.733625 "afterwards" i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean you're talking about the person's already been found guilty
sw4370B-ms98-a-0025 166.588125 172.721125 uh and i think that would provide "a more fair" sentencing procedure
sw4370B-ms98-a-0030 201.702375 211.391250 "but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment" of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system
sw4371B-ms98-a-0041 133.156000 143.924500 yeah i'm not sure i- i- i kind of think i'd like to go with uh "something around a a one fifty i don't want a full size but i don't want uh one of those little uh mini trucks either"
sw4372A-ms98-a-0007 61.350250 64.791250 "Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but"
sw4372A-ms98-a-0013 119.418375 122.720250 i[s]- b[ut]- is it also "legal"
sw4372A-ms98-a-0026 217.600000 220.560375 "no businesses um" if
sw4372A-ms98-a-0028 230.429500 237.457750 i- i might buy the motherboards from Utah but then still have to pay some Pennsylvania sales tax my a[partment]- "accounting department will at the end of the month"
sw4372A-ms98-a-0035 286.716375 298.466000 is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism "jus[t]- just to do just that" in order in order to gain the revenue that's being lost um and i- i don't know if i agree with that but it b[ut]-
sw4372B-ms98-a-0010 100.012000 107.265250 "and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed"
sw4372B-ms98-a-0013 148.319250 161.681250 well i think that if if policy is established "and if a mechanism is put into place" to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion
sw4372B-ms98-a-0014 161.681250 174.362500 "then i don't argue with it because" it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need [noise] to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania
sw4372B-ms98-a-0026 254.982875 264.719500 um but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves "then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that"
sw4374B-ms98-a-0065 210.847500 221.506000 yeah "well i think that" one thing that people don't do a lot of these days a lot of people just live from paycheck to paycheck and don't have enough to put away
sw4376B-ms98-a-0007 20.412250 22.015625 "loosely"
sw4378A-ms98-a-0020 98.967250 107.668875 and "i guess" we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that
sw4378A-ms98-a-0036 207.819375 219.753625 and that's why you're "and the the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in because" the windows are something that is conducive to
sw4378A-ms98-a-0046 249.694000 256.540500 "oh these are so you have the sash windows in" d[id]- did uh did it g[o]- go up and down oh i see
sw4379A-ms98-a-0050 210.356875 219.567000 "really" well you know um what do you do as far as i- i take it do you um run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing
sw4379B-ms98-a-0025 145.120000 147.561500 "that money is put into each month"
sw4380A-ms98-a-0034 180.676250 187.464500 yeah and again i don't i mean again i don't know that i'm you know how qualified i "mean i think it'd be interesting"
sw4380B-ms98-a-0041 177.775625 180.963625 "i don't get some kind of motivation to learn and"
sw4380B-ms98-a-0057 237.182625 241.516750 did send their kids to private schools i think they compare fair[ly]- "you know fairly well"
sw4387B-ms98-a-0002 1.650125 11.221125 uh it it varies i[t's]- it's totally dependent upon what mood i'm in it can be anything from classical "to um uh rock and roll"
sw4400B-ms98-a-0009 60.947375 67.888375 uh in fact i got my wife a a used car that was "uh also a Chevy celebrity because"
sw4400B-ms98-a-0053 261.705250 271.212375 yeah ye[ah]- "somebody told me uh once the" a casual conversation that this guy ran a a towing service
sw4433B-ms98-a-0040 238.699250 247.727000 so the the policeman stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on "you know the dog mess"
sw4440B-ms98-a-0006 22.824500 27.295000 "and that program is designed to uh"
sw4443A-ms98-a-0015 45.454875 58.491750 but and then quit for awhile and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple years ago "and uh i've been playing you know off and on when i can" up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course but
sw4443A-ms98-a-0026 99.280375 102.479625 "can you get like a a student discount type of thing" or
sw4445B-ms98-a-0002 2.811375 13.477375 well "we have the the usual automotive pollution" that and although it's not very visible you don't worry about that uh too much uh but uh
sw4445B-ms98-a-0031 185.514500 197.703250 settled in Eastern Texas where the green rolling hills are and and when they finally beat the Mexicans the Mexicans said fine you can have East Texas but l[ong]- "as long only as long as you take west Texas too" [laughter]
sw4448B-ms98-a-0050 245.458125 247.568375 "have you ever been sport fishing"
sw4448B-ms98-a-0057 277.238500 288.426500 "oh yeah yeah that was really uh rea[lly]- i guess they may be about three feet long" not four but u[m]- um that was something they really fought like
sw4467A-ms98-a-0032 216.850500 228.331125 any connection with what they they vote and what happens so they very frustrated and they don't do anything so there's learned helplessness type of "you know no matter what i do it's not" gonna help so why bother
sw4474B-ms98-a-0019 131.760500 134.935625 "a young adult in the family just about"
sw4483A-ms98-a-0005 33.872250 45.294125 they've got these on "it's it's county wide program now" and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash
sw4483A-ms98-a-0017 105.592000 119.183750 [noise] you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that "generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one"
sw4483A-ms98-a-0018 119.183750 132.916250 "they don't want it to change their lifestyle" and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know i mean it's a little extra work and uh
sw4483A-ms98-a-0018 119.183750 132.916250 they don't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know "i mean it's a little extra work" and uh
sw4483A-ms98-a-0021 147.177000 160.777375 um or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and cer[tain]- "certain dimensions tie them_1 up and put them" by the curb well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it's about a foot and a half deep and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long
sw4483A-ms98-a-0023 167.438000 169.811375 "and so like"
sw4483A-ms98-a-0024 169.811375 180.467500 you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and and if you've got uh food containers or anything like that it's a big problem "so not only do you"
sw4483A-ms98-a-0047 259.169375 262.853750 "yeah about_1 an hour about_1 an hour south of Tampa"

sw4488A-ms98-a-0019 98.007250 106.311500 they're mostly used i mean to they cause a lot of "a[ccidents]- they there are a lot of accidents because of them being so" handy
sw4493B-ms98-a-0015 41.038000 46.056375 i used to play three which was the clarinet but i've that's since "[laughter-gone] [laughter-into] disuse"

sw4495B-ms98-a-0023 96.045625 107.301375 "i used to work at um summer camps" um a lot when i was in high school and college and i worked at some summer camps in New Mexico where um
sw4497B-ms98-a-0028 235.236875 246.467625 "of the you know the whole situation" and it's a decision that my parents have made and it won't be a drain on our resources because it'll mean just
sw4502A-ms98-a-0016 68.106125 73.088125 "so" they try but you know very few actually go
sw4502A-ms98-a-0041 194.148500 206.984375 that it really doesn't [laughter-save] [laughter-you] any money if it's a money thing and as a deterrent thing i don't really think uh personally i don't feel that capital "pun[ishment]- punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal i don't think that really works that much"
sw4503B-ms98-a-0007 51.161000 61.493500 "i don't know i just feel like my daughters are in college now and the last three years their life they went to public school" and they made straight As and they're really struggling in college now
sw4512B-ms98-a-0044 228.711000 239.867625 and why i- i don't know i just don't see any i don't uh i don't see any importance at all in my vote in the you know in that in that even "that smaller uh"
sw4519A-ms98-a-0014 93.255250 104.642125 um they were "where i came from in uh Dallas" [noise] yeah so uh
sw4519A-ms98-a-0022 165.665750 177.910000 "you know if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making" almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so
sw4519A-ms98-a-0023 177.910000 183.523625 "i stopped worrying about money" and uh never have worried about money since then
sw4519A-ms98-a-0030 237.001750 239.390750 "uh how big is your family"
sw4519B-ms98-a-0028 183.682750 186.544375 "well that's that's a system too"
sw4522B-ms98-a-0036 133.871750 142.875750 uh at the same time "you have to restrain him because they might hurt themselves they might stand up and not be able to stay stood up or might fall down or whatever"
sw4523A-ms98-a-0006 43.745500 51.664875 um-hum "yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i'm" i'm probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that uh
sw4523A-ms98-a-0010 71.773250 84.238750 someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period "but uh i- i guess the uh NRA they kind of look at it as a springboard" towards more restrictive gun controls and
sw4523A-ms98-a-0038 278.394750 285.791500 "but they uh they might even [laughter-get] [laughter-a] [laughter-little]" [laughter-carried] [laughter-away] you know with the lobbying and and whatnot but
sw4531B-ms98-a-0013 33.752000 37.884500 i see "i s[ee]- do many people listen to country music"
sw4531B-ms98-a-0064 250.936875 259.333000 "but it does yeah it's kind of like making a comeback it's just cyclical and just kind of making a comeback now i guess and that's what they enjoy hearing"
sw4548A-ms98-a-0018 100.268250 103.888375 i'm not sure "executing them uh"
sw4548A-ms98-a-0030 145.759750 150.767375 "well i the cost is something but it's i think it's relatively unimportant compared to"
sw4548A-ms98-a-0051 231.709125 244.280625 i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh "like i said some years ago i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the"
sw4548A-ms98-a-0054 257.344500 260.945000 "uh i guess i'm" i'm my view of
sw4548B-ms98-a-0019 120.193875 130.540875 it that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia i mean you guys are are a lot more "uh for" to each his own even than we are in Georgia but even in Georgia
sw4555B-ms98-a-0017 83.017250 88.349000 "and they also provide towels and shower facilities and lockers and everything so"
sw4565A-ms98-a-0006 34.200875 40.570375 "uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents"
sw4565A-ms98-a-0016 84.982500 88.752375 "so i refuse to have one in the house" yeah
sw4565B-ms98-a-0014 86.594125 89.743000 oh really "well good for you"
sw4565B-ms98-a-0017 97.925625 101.370750 i "thought about it a lot" [laughter]
sw4565B-ms98-a-0058 279.365625 288.623875 my wife works at night so "she does uh Tupperware so she's gone a lot at nights and so" i spend a lot of time with them_1
sw4570B-ms98-a-0002 1.955875 5.755750 i have one "she's twenty months old"
sw4570B-ms98-a-0060 242.627125 253.501375 it's hard to tell i "at twenty months old he's he wants take her to the zoo and that sort of thing but i'm not sure if she's ready for any of that if she's you know if it could hold her interest"
sw4572A-ms98-a-0014 40.697250 45.081625 "i don't know i don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there but"
sw4572A-ms98-a-0037 158.685875 167.194750 you know controll[ed]- "controlled substance then" you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person
sw4588A-ms98-a-0058 252.562500 259.401250 "we may have covered a uh" a minuscule portion of politics today [laughter]
sw4590B-ms98-a-0027 135.144125 146.878625 "um-hum well i think that's like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people don't they're not cracking down they let them back out on the street they don't really take away their license they don't really make sure they can't drive anymore"
sw4590B-ms98-a-0044 252.993250 262.939250 people be um the juries won't want to convict a person because "what happens if they are they're really innocent because_1 once and you kill them_1 they're gone" you can't like fix the problem so
sw4594A-ms98-a-0006 34.487250 37.251000 "right and you make more money but it goes away anyway"
sw4595A-ms98-a-0013 61.122875 74.901250 right right i think that you get a much fairer deal with a jury "than you do with a judge and that's" that's been [laughter-my] [laughter-experience] and and i really think that i think that judges are very prejudice
sw4603A-ms98-a-0009 24.967500 33.220000 uh i know that f[rom]- because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about "his Eagle"
sw4603A-ms98-a-0010 33.220000 43.108250 and uh in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in um citizenship in the "community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world"
sw4603A-ms98-a-0025 117.804000 128.426125 um which many people uh are lifelong employees of but i suspect that that's not what they had in mind either more "of a voluntary kind of" thing or uh
sw4603A-ms98-a-0033 224.102875 225.437625 "why is that"
sw4603B-ms98-a-0044 240.880625 246.836375 [noise] well "that's one view" [laughter] and you know and
sw4603B-ms98-a-0054 278.887750 287.359750 "so at at any rate this is getting off the topic but i[t]-" my my point was that there is for people who don't want to do the military service there
sw4605B-ms98-a-0025 89.530500 93.970875 "but actually yeah you have to" do it randomly otherwise people will cheat
sw4605B-ms98-a-0037 131.702000 139.259750 uh we get counseling and uh i think part of our pay is docked if we're "first time offenders"
sw4611A-ms98-a-0009 40.442250 53.599250 um i'm basically not interested and i also find "the um" everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and mis[guided]- and off the um
sw4611B-ms98-a-0018 120.925375 124.607000 "and the view that i'd [laughter-rather] take" is that
sw4615A-ms98-a-0017 118.271125 127.143500 it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out i'm going to keep it and uh "keep it in there and let it grow" so that some way
sw4615B-ms98-a-0006 16.916250 21.513000 extra to go around uh "long term is"
sw4615B-ms98-a-0009 34.584125 45.506875 so we're we're starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement but "with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it"
sw4616B-ms98-a-0006 18.406125 30.994125 "and course Car and Driver i've got t[wo]- two" teenage boys that are in the market for a car so we i've been trying to teach them how to read for what's a good deal and what's to to get as far as insurance costs et cetera
sw4616B-ms98-a-0006 18.406125 30.994125 and of course Car and Driver i've got t[wo]- two teenage boys that are in the market for a car "so we i've been trying to teach them how to read for what's a good deal and what's to" to get as far as insurance costs et cetera
sw4616B-ms98-a-0029 222.782375 231.098750 "and you can be talking to a customer service representative while you are looking at the pamphlet where with the magazine" any questions you have you write to the editor and you have to wait for the answer
sw4617A-ms98-a-0009 27.699250 38.669250 whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing and "seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now uh at least"
sw4617A-ms98-a-0012 49.041000 52.072875 "you know maybe know what the"
sw4617A-ms98-a-0047 246.956375 253.516250 "maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote"
sw4617A-ms98-a-0049 257.368625 258.978000 "right"
sw4617A-ms98-a-0058 280.578875 294.683250 i got called but i uh never uh got selected for a jury i "sat for" tw[elve]- ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process and they had
sw4617B-ms98-a-0004 4.840500 13.299125 tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink [laughter] "they're innocent right" [laughter]
sw4617B-ms98-a-0018 62.015750 65.144125 "capital cases like maybe the death penalty"
sw4617B-ms98-a-0020 70.220500 73.983750 "i mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people"
sw4617B-ms98-a-0024 85.718250 91.791750 i- i think that's i- think that's the way it is "uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh"
sw4618A-ms98-a-0005 19.131375 20.967500 "and been tested"
sw4618A-ms98-a-0033 167.013250 174.801125 if this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive "we won't hire them"
sw4618A-ms98-a-0051 264.559500 265.895375 "really"
sw4618B-ms98-a-0037 257.499375 267.338750 and it it's like it seems like now they have [trests/tests] i guess they can test your hair and they can find "out if you use drugs" up to several years ago
sw4619A-ms98-a-0016 71.586875 76.559250 "um i mean the the environment there i don't know too much about it but it it seems"
sw4619A-ms98-a-0020 92.678625 103.236375 y[eah]- "yeah well i-" i- i don['t]- i don't know we we also my wife and i uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house we um
sw4624A-ms98-a-0033 169.541375 179.504000 you know and then y[ou]- y[ou]- you find out you can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these people have been "you know dumping information about you in there and i've heard of cases where it was just done vindictively"
sw4626A-ms98-a-0037 183.111000 184.517750 "uh-huh"
sw4628A-ms98-a-0014 56.413875 67.733250 um and uh so we're we're part we're actually part of MIT so it's very much the same kind of place and "a technical institution"
sw4628B-ms98-a-0006 26.899500 33.469000 "the area i work in it" it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so
sw4628B-ms98-a-0030 132.404000 137.753125 "uh i think the company still exists what they used to do is they used to"
sw4628B-ms98-a-0044 223.865000 232.898625 uh for the bad times of the company "what about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well"
sw4629B-ms98-a-0052 269.866625 272.023500 "and yeah that's"
sw4630A-ms98-a-0021 93.653500 100.490375 to see if they did it "or if they uh criticize you or" put something in there wrong sure sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0062 244.025625 248.035000 sure i suppose you watch for hurr[icanes]- "hurricanes coming in and"
sw4633A-ms98-a-0028 142.761375 145.021750 "well you can't afford to"
sw4640A-ms98-a-0034 217.548000 227.557250 "you know you've got" as i said there's no incen[tive]- incentive to go into [vocalized-noise] i mean look at our state legislature and things where very nominal pay but there's also not you know
sw4641A-ms98-a-0008 42.473500 46.149875 "that's true y[eah]- yeah you don't you don't want to have worry about it" [laughter]
sw4641A-ms98-a-0019 123.713375 135.465875 yeah i know i know exactly how you feel but i- i also don't kn[ow]- you know ho[w]- "how can we get people" to change it i mean it it kind of it kind of requires you know a company taking a risk and they don't want to do that [laughter]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0021 185.971500 193.736875 and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired an[d]- "but i hear that bill is in the Senate right now and it's"
sw4644B-ms98-a-0022 193.736875 195.899375 "hopefully will go through"
sw4644B-ms98-a-0023 195.899375 208.183000 but um you know i think the schools are at where the schools isn't just the school system "and not just the teachers they took in the whole town plus all" you know
sw4646A-ms98-a-0008 30.189000 35.544250 "they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and"
sw4646B-ms98-a-0035 237.919875 240.145875 "right right"
sw4646B-ms98-a-0036 240.145875 251.538875 "so it's it's just so complicated anymore i think" people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is you're extending life
sw4649A-ms98-a-0014 36.843500 42.617875 "i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy car or refrigerator something you'd like to get it from some"
sw4649A-ms98-a-0047 173.308500 180.250500 "um" one or another of the boys in uh child care for part ti[me]- just for part of the day
sw4649A-ms98-a-0050 189.231875 198.906875 is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for [noise] whether it's a loving and caring place or not and uh "so i would always trust her judgment on that"
sw4649B-ms98-a-0009 46.177750 51.262875 "i guess not usu[ally]-" i suppose you're absolutely right there um-hum
sw4650B-ms98-a-0015 72.413250 83.635125 oh i don't know um "i- i like reading up on the news um" and sometimes i like some science stuff but not much actually so
sw4655A-ms98-a-0008 65.189375 77.820250 "got out of that kind of situation but" uh they they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help and
sw4655A-ms98-a-0026 148.906625 163.566000 in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other "uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh"
sw4655B-ms98-a-0010 107.820375 115.582500 i have an aunt who lived on her own -[un]til she was well in her nineties "and then she she got sick and she ended up in a nursing home"
sw4659A-ms98-a-0018 105.577125 115.234625 we can throw them_1 in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us "and we have no downtime"
sw4659A-ms98-a-0021 131.708875 141.034250 so they say that's really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your "your time in between things"
sw4659B-ms98-a-0007 13.865875 17.124375 um "i know that" uh
sw4659B-ms98-a-0038 228.012625 235.713000 in terms of the long term effect effect on on America in terms of the culture and everything "i don't know um"
sw4660B-ms98-a-0003 2.787750 15.663250 "generally i get most of my news from uh the radio" and then sometimes um if i've got time i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that i like
sw4660B-ms98-a-0059 294.198250 296.918250 "take it easy" bye-bye
sw4661B-ms98-a-0014 69.687500 80.428625 it is an[d]- and it's happening in in a lot of public schools "uh because of of budget cuts but on the other hand what it does provide is is for the um"
sw4661B-ms98-a-0045 269.081625 278.328125 "uh and i'd even encourage a liberal arts school with an engineering program but i tend to look i don't like what i see from the students who are graduating here with engineering degrees"
sw4666A-ms98-a-0021 95.112000 100.562125 [noise] "and uh i don't know what is the prognosis for uh this year"
sw4666B-ms98-a-0002 6.401250 12.442000 "no it's it's pretty pervasive it kind of [laughter-goes] into" about all aspects of society i think up here
sw4666B-ms98-a-0006 31.816625 36.183125 "so i'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything but"
sw4666B-ms98-a-0047 209.445500 221.348125 and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because_1 apparently he'd bought uh he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat "or a row of seats actually"
sw4666B-ms98-a-0048 221.348125 226.349750 "for the home games but th[e]-" the thing is there's like eighty six home games per year
sw4666B-ms98-a-0050 229.583625 238.259875 "eighty six i was amazed to hear that" you know that's just the home games and i i thought it was a mistake but he goes no see eight
sw4669B-ms98-a-0029 90.412625 93.302875 it's a "you know a" [noise]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0054 181.319375 187.948875 "i mean uh i build a uh i have a stock English garden bench which i make"
sw4674B-ms98-a-0003 3.209625 8.195875 "okay our last family reunion that we had was with my father's family"
sw4675A-ms98-a-0037 125.481750 132.994625 "yeah so you know i really have to try to budget" that i don't go over that amount you know each month
sw4675B-ms98-a-0005 9.361500 22.808000 [vocalized-noise] all my bills how much i'm going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me "which is every other week" uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything
sw4675B-ms98-a-0025 92.436875 99.510625 "i sometimes it can be" sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing i've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things
sw4675B-ms98-a-0034 122.172500 126.622875 and that last week's pretty lean "generally [laughter-speaking] so"
sw4675B-ms98-a-0039 153.642375 156.076250 "and and that worked okay for me"
sw4675B-ms98-a-0041 162.248000 169.232000 "it's yeah it's really bad" but um it's going pretty well and i've got a real good plan mapped out here so
sw4679A-ms98-a-0011 80.125500 84.535125 it's "i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh"
sw4679A-ms98-a-0012 84.535125 88.416750 uh the judge is also "sort of a jury"
sw4679B-ms98-a-0007 28.320625 35.641000 i mean prove a person guilty "if you don't really know or you don't really have a eyewitness"
sw4681A-ms98-a-0023 124.290500 132.720750 except for everything keeps going up "you know and i know as a middle class um" you know and also i have one dependent has
sw4682A-ms98-a-0011 84.057625 91.052625 uh James Avery i don't know if you have that up there but it's it's a very good "company that sells sterling silver things and"
sw4687B-ms98-a-0051 255.831875 258.157500 "oh sure yeah"
sw4688A-ms98-a-0003 15.083500 18.402375 "what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer"
sw4688A-ms98-a-0047 229.896125 237.386750 of an outfit called US Shoe or something [vocalized-noise] it "was a computer subsidiary i don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company"
sw4688B-ms98-a-0026 172.570375 180.277875 "so you know the four days before they only have a four day week" and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in
sw4688B-ms98-a-0047 280.860625 289.243625 uh yes we do and we try to "you know i keep track of every penny" and more or less enter it in you know every single day i'm at the computer
sw4691A-ms98-a-0017 94.224500 97.467000 "i'm trying" [laughter]
sw4695B-ms98-a-0042 199.646500 211.156125 yeah where well some people set up towers other people use a fishing line and pull wires up into trees and use wire antennas or whatever -[de]pending on how energetic the club is but "uh"
sw4696B-ms98-a-0042 254.089125 259.874500 worry a whole lot about where the funding was coming from "so he'd have that advantage"
sw4697A-ms98-a-0051 243.737125 256.028375 yeah bu[t]- well you can tell i haven't been in too many [laughter-juries] [laughter-judges] [laughter-chambers] [laughter-or] [laughter-anything] [laughter-like] [laughter-that] [laughter] and well i was called once when i was nineteen "and um"
sw4697B-ms98-a-0012 109.290250 117.206375 one of the "parties wants one" and i usually it's the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
sw4697B-ms98-a-0027 218.466625 230.629000 uh it's to their advantage to play to as big an [laughter-audience] [laughter-as] [laughter-possible] "so uh i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases"
sw4697B-ms98-a-0037 265.987250 278.598000 uh-huh i[t]- it isn't sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in "uh that would have been about" uh twenty years too um uh just last year and
sw4698A-ms98-a-0006 15.944250 29.978250 uh up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago i got one for my son a a M[acintosh]- Macintosh "uh LC it's a" real easy to use color uh
sw4698A-ms98-a-0022 138.498250 150.748500 uh but now i find myself using the computer even the computer at work is "primarily a um" word processing system and a communication system
sw4698A-ms98-a-0042 280.043000 291.822750 i[t's]- i[t's]- "it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old-timers even the people who are technologists don't" know how to operate these electronic things like VCR's and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy
sw4698B-ms98-a-0030 157.348125 169.120375 yeah it's "i- i uh i have a modem in my" computer so i can log into the sys[tem]- the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful but um
sw4698B-ms98-a-0031 169.120375 182.189375 yeah that's that and word processing is while i tend to i mean obviously i do most of my "almost all of my report writing" on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments
sw4698B-ms98-a-0055 290.875375 300.162000 yeah well i[f]- if if th[e]- if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge i think "you know for a lot of kids" tha[t]-
sw4703B-ms98-a-0002 0.436625 4.546000 "so what is your opinion on on drug testing"
sw4703B-ms98-a-0019 198.231750 204.599750 right the question becomes what do you do about somebody who [testses/tests] "who test positive"
sw4707A-ms98-a-0019 50.108375 56.997125 um "um particularly" uh in this part of the country wh[ere]- um i guess
sw4707A-ms98-a-0021 62.653250 73.149875 "um i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a" federal form
sw4707A-ms98-a-0056 193.810000 195.771000 "yeah since uh"
sw4707A-ms98-a-0060 211.935000 221.650125 countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the "with the same tax money"
sw4707A-ms98-a-0064 240.889500 249.207750 i do thi[nk]- yeah that's true i think in places "i think in places like California people are beginning to find that in" in areas that are fairly well off
sw4707A-ms98-a-0065 249.207750 263.711000 if you add the um uh "people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun the[y]-" people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get the tax bill passed no matter what happens
sw4707A-ms98-a-0070 283.630250 291.661250 "right yeah" people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools [laughter] because_1 it means more to them
sw4707B-ms98-a-0022 103.852125 108.037500 "but that's the {politicalness} of trying to not" create any new taxes
sw4707B-ms98-a-0024 136.586125 145.508500 well and i still think having lived in Europe for awhile you know [noise] "the difference in living conditions" are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it
sw4709A-ms98-a-0006 15.996000 17.453250 "right"
sw4709A-ms98-a-0013 55.190500 61.274625 "but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important" uh
sw4709B-ms98-a-0006 22.886250 29.150000 "as well as good long term and short term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs"
sw4709B-ms98-a-0019 126.305750 128.899500 "i suspect that it just disappeared"
sw4709B-ms98-a-0034 170.085625 174.323875 "so did did Ryder get out of the business is that what happened or"
sw4709B-ms98-a-0041 205.939000 209.970000 and "and that's exceedingly expensive"
sw4710A-ms98-a-0038 141.511750 154.180875 well because of its colonial you know background and then of course during the Civil Wa[r]- or during prior and during the Civil War it was a border state you know with half the state n[orthern]- northern and half the state southern "you know in sentiment and so forth"
sw4716A-ms98-a-0022 97.016250 105.722625 semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch a person and and uh get him down "but um"
sw4716B-ms98-a-0018 131.205500 133.023125 "right yeah"
sw4716B-ms98-a-0036 180.090375 187.427250 if you're to say okay we have to get rid of them_1 all because you know they can only they only seem to do bad it "it's um" it's saying we're too
sw4718A-ms98-a-0006 8.193375 13.077000 we have quite a quite a few benefits "and uh we have um"
sw4718A-ms98-a-0013 40.054375 45.097750 what you're doing i think and uh that's "something that um"
sw4718A-ms98-a-0038 148.016625 155.792625 yeah "my wife used to work for a credit [noise] union group" they ma[gazine]- they had a newsletter that went out to all the
sw4718A-ms98-a-0040 166.183875 172.726500 uh it was it was a company um "i think it was called Credit Union News or something"
sw4718A-ms98-a-0067 256.803500 258.093125 "okay well"
sw4720A-ms98-a-0014 38.843750 41.296125 "yes and um"
sw4720A-ms98-a-0050 202.725000 211.602250 it's uh it's so important to families then and uh and yet anybody whose "gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up"
sw4720A-ms98-a-0070 282.480250 288.310375 [laughter] "oh listen i have friends in a lot of different cities if you'd just fly me there i'll take care of that"
sw4720B-ms98-a-0046 232.446625 244.840125 some of them_1 uh "my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency" and uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy
sw4721A-ms98-a-0037 254.360375 265.781250 you have to because there's always more things to do there is always things that you can make priority to it but "i just i don't demand a lot for myself and so"
sw4721B-ms98-a-0052 217.636500 225.027000 "it my subconscious is working on things while i'm working and i" i go back and i've got new ideas but but still
sw4721B-ms98-a-0062 250.543500 258.797250 yeah i think that's uh i i think that's a good term de[manding]- "demanding the time for yourself but you" you've just got to you've just got to prioriti[ze]- right
sw4723A-ms98-a-0039 239.713875 248.849625 twenty seconds yeah that's all it takes i mean it's just a button that's it you you release it "right at the top so" you don't have to get out or anything
sw4723A-ms98-a-0039 239.713875 248.849625 twenty seconds yeah that's all it takes i mean it's just a button that's it you you release it right at the top so you don't have "to get out or anything"
sw4725A-ms98-a-0006 57.153875 67.919375 well the thing of it is if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh "go on public assistance" uh
sw4725A-ms98-a-0023 164.550250 175.031250 but "uh um" the um the local taxes here i- i i[n]- in this particular area um you know i've uh i think i pay about uh oh
sw4725A-ms98-a-0029 214.806875 219.586375 "but uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer"

sw4728A-ms98-a-0061 235.164750 240.350250 "if i only had some place that i could store the uh camper top i would have it off most of the time"
sw4728B-ms98-a-0010 29.104250 31.163625 "[laughter]"
sw4728B-ms98-a-0058 239.709250 241.212750 "right"
sw4733A-ms98-a-0012 29.800125 33.738875 i do too i "oh i think that's awful"
sw4733A-ms98-a-0033 197.572500 204.278000 and my feeling is that you you know you're only a kid once and you don't "wanna spend your whole life in school"
sw4733A-ms98-a-0047 273.559625 281.173625 "that's a very long day for kindergarten" but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this
sw4733B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 12.092750 [noise] "uh do you have children" in school um i have two that are uh now just about_1 ready to graduate from college but i also have two that are just entering school um
sw4734B-ms98-a-0013 71.753750 83.311625 and so they were cleaning it up and the guy hit something he couldn't see what it was and so "he dragged it up into the shallow end and it was a garbage can and inside the garbage can was a body"
sw4735A-ms98-a-0050 283.752000 288.703500 "you know but then again those that have" physically assaulted somebody
sw4735B-ms98-a-0032 238.145375 250.374000 because there's nothing in there that to "[rebil/rehabilitate] [rebilitate/rehabilitate]" re[habilitate]- [rebilihatate/rehabilitate] them and then when they get out they because they have the {stigmatism} of being in jail they ca[n't]-
sw4736A-ms98-a-0017 147.214375 159.843625 uh you know a a non a non critical e[rror]- error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know "the guy was a law breaker is being supported"
sw4736B-ms98-a-0015 254.824750 262.858000 "is to protect those who actually didn't commit the crimes all be it it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal"
sw4745A-ms98-a-0007 50.307375 60.355125 um "jus[t]- just to maintain your home and maintain" the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children
sw4745A-ms98-a-0010 67.014750 75.921500 "you know i look at my daughter and she's now uh" four going to be four and i keep saying oh jeez i don't have that much time with her [laughter]
sw4745A-ms98-a-0043 193.492250 203.354625 "feel to place their children into care and" you know it's our society saying yes this um you need this job
sw4749B-ms98-a-0037 193.980375 200.662500 "and the American cars the uh one advantage one a[dvantage]- one big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less"
sw4752B-ms98-a-0059 255.358750 259.236250 "yeah it's" it's to bad because it's um i mean
sw4758A-ms98-a-0017 58.804750 61.535125 [noise] "yeah i used to take that right"
sw4758A-ms98-a-0045 178.684750 183.337625 "i used to get that" so now that i'm into dolls that's about
sw4758B-ms98-a-0052 271.001000 280.598250 because_1 i don't [laughter-expect] [laughter-to] [laughter-be] [laughter-traveling] [laughter-overseas] in in the future for quite awhile "but i- i usually just read through the sections on on domestic stuff"
sw4759A-ms98-a-0060 245.831375 255.721375 yeah that yeah i just came back to find jeans for the little one and "it does add up yeah" but um
sw4759B-ms98-a-0007 49.313250 63.543875 "his check once a month pays all" the bills my check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of [laughter-thing] and it works out real well that way so we don't run into a lot of problems
sw4759B-ms98-a-0023 141.902250 143.185125 "yeah"
sw4759B-ms98-a-0051 284.973125 292.012750 oh i would too i would i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to "to"
sw4765A-ms98-a-0009 51.198375 56.696500 "and so uh but but y[ou]- but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that"
sw4765A-ms98-a-0013 79.555875 85.335125 "and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful"
sw4765B-ms98-a-0017 94.915750 98.328250 "well i guess mainly because um"
sw4765B-ms98-a-0025 137.995875 143.523000 you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess "maybe a little longer"
sw4770A-ms98-a-0008 81.776375 90.359375 but it's always the rich person that gets into government that has "uh the money to advertise the money to d[o]-" to do this there's no more Abe
sw4770B-ms98-a-0027 293.805875 296.166500 "uh check kiting scam"
sw4774A-ms98-a-0053 222.515500 224.267375 "the what"
sw4774B-ms98-a-0008 23.965500 26.747750 "right so do i" [laughter]
sw4774B-ms98-a-0021 107.501375 116.502250 "oh gosh uh" any people who had dr[ug]- tested positively getting them into a drug program or rehab program
sw4774B-ms98-a-0051 285.142625 292.028375 "well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea[chers]-" you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
sw4784A-ms98-a-0024 116.192500 127.375375 people are um reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh "when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh" they don't have kids in the schools
sw4784A-ms98-a-0042 242.852750 257.038375 "and um" i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and i'm really sad to say this i never thought i would have but i really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem
sw4784B-ms98-a-0016 144.897750 158.134750 "right it troubles me too" th[at]- that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and [noise] by [laughter-definition] for some of us at least the public good includes
sw4784B-ms98-a-0017 158.134750 171.785875 having an educated populace i mean the idea uh that uh you can make a sound judgment [noise] "with respect to" [noise] small votes in in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level uh
sw4784B-ms98-a-0018 171.785875 179.543250 uh "it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and" the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
sw4785A-ms98-a-0017 37.013250 39.425250 "so it was an hour you know"
sw4785A-ms98-a-0020 49.470000 51.446625 [laughter] "six years"
sw4785A-ms98-a-0028 63.104250 65.036125 "well yeah yeah"
sw4785A-ms98-a-0081 269.483250 271.233625 "and uh"
sw4785B-ms98-a-0016 50.786125 56.036000 "so they were all real close" that's tough that's a lot of time
sw4785B-ms98-a-0019 60.116875 65.205875 "uh well" qualify that she worked at home i'm sure [laughter]
sw4785B-ms98-a-0044 183.456250 185.736375 "and what would you do what"
sw4788A-ms98-a-0026 156.312625 158.043125 "yeah yeah"
sw4788A-ms98-a-0029 164.365375 167.910125 that was really called "roughing it yeah"
sw4788A-ms98-a-0040 193.795625 203.320125 than you sure than it "when you were younger uh-huh" i[t]- it it's with kids we don't care if they take a shower everyday with kids we don't care you know uh
sw4788B-ms98-a-0021 131.193250 135.528375 usually just camp near some "stream or some lake"
sw4788B-ms98-a-0027 159.815000 169.052875 uh "a bathroom or a shower or anything near" by [laughter] it was dig your own hole and um and i
sw4792A-ms98-a-0018 35.764250 39.778500 "no and e[ven]- even like you know" two thirds majority i mean
sw4792A-ms98-a-0029 71.327750 79.648375 plus you know you may be you know doing a you know a a guilty verdict but it may not be "you know may be for technical reasons" [laughter]
sw4792B-ms98-a-0024 112.375250 115.912125 yeah "yeah i've got some friends that are lawyers so"
sw4792B-ms98-a-0025 115.912125 118.394000 "one of them_1 just got his law degree"
sw4792B-ms98-a-0031 136.087000 143.257125 i'm sure of it because_1 a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint "and who can argue their case better"
sw4792B-ms98-a-0034 150.602000 153.493500 "and how weird those cases get"
sw4796B-ms98-a-0030 138.273875 151.716125 i've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems "would be to have uh" some sort of uh solar power satellites up
sw4796B-ms98-a-0031 151.716125 165.818375 "uh because" that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact
sw4796B-ms98-a-0039 211.337625 216.349000 and they want to do the research and "uh they're all" [noise]
sw4798B-ms98-a-0005 7.659375 17.375500 uh "i'm not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh California that o[n]-" on and off and on and off [noise] um
sw4798B-ms98-a-0010 48.245500 55.926750 "some crimes and and some lives that that that there's no [laughter-other]" at least emotional reaction to it what about you
sw4799A-ms98-a-0002 3.638750 8.371125 "you know my my parents are not quite at that age yet so i haven't"
sw4799A-ms98-a-0008 34.270375 35.954750 "did it really"
sw4799A-ms98-a-0051 188.782250 197.539875 yeah she can but i- i think it is also cafeteria style because_1 i- i really i- "i-" i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself
sw4799A-ms98-a-0052 197.539875 199.208625 "so uh"
sw4799B-ms98-a-0016 71.446375 73.124250 "and uh"
sw4799B-ms98-a-0023 104.346375 106.997750 "and they got her going again"
sw4801A-ms98-a-0042 174.870375 184.429500 i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient "um kind of takes away"
sw4801A-ms98-a-0047 196.610875 198.849500 "yeah what do you do"
sw4802B-ms98-a-0026 114.745500 118.508750 "and how we uh" interact with one another
sw4802B-ms98-a-0042 192.073125 194.586375 [laughter] "so i i enjoy it"
sw4802B-ms98-a-0062 257.712250 260.910250 "but uh there's other authors also that have uh"
sw4805A-ms98-a-0027 130.440625 133.668125 "yeah you can" you can
sw4805A-ms98-a-0030 144.343875 157.552625 um "-[re]quires a little more research" that kind of thing so that's why i say it probably mo[st]- in most cases i would think it would co[me]- the outcome would be better in most cases not always but uh
sw4812A-ms98-a-0029 131.528250 133.185375 "but um"
sw4812B-ms98-a-0011 58.860375 69.465875 drawback i can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that "might give some uh sort of false positive result"
sw4812B-ms98-a-0043 250.535500 254.305750 "do do they test you at right now at work too"
sw4814B-ms98-a-0002 0.688625 4.167750 "so interesting political trends or events huh"
sw4814B-ms98-a-0010 44.990125 47.067375 "like out of nowhere yeah"
sw4821B-ms98-a-0034 222.359250 228.768125 "i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world" rather than simply being aware that
sw4822B-ms98-a-0016 206.521500 215.010000 "and uh you know perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that uh we'd normally do down here that" are damaging to the environment
sw4826A-ms98-a-0024 85.394000 92.856000 "for example i have a brother in North Carolina" and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible
sw4826B-ms98-a-0031 145.697625 148.942375 to "deal with on an [laughter-every] [laughter-day] [laughter-basis]"
sw4826B-ms98-a-0034 158.349625 166.750750 "and when you have" two kids in that class that constantly keep the [ca/class] class in an uproar and you're not at liberty
sw4829B-ms98-a-0023 120.252875 132.295750 "right so it's so that's nice it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up and they just" were talking about a bill in Tucson about that but uh
sw4829B-ms98-a-0024 132.295750 134.931375 uh "it didn't go through"
sw4829B-ms98-a-0028 149.374000 157.174250 was "reducing the garbage" collection in order to make that up or something you know um
sw4829B-ms98-a-0036 197.231625 209.041250 they're um trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are "that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that" that makes it easier i guess
sw4830A-ms98-a-0003 6.154875 13.564000 did we di[d]- wha[t]- do what do we think about a judge making the decision "and i really don't agree with that"
sw4830A-ms98-a-0028 132.625250 147.475250 in in that regard i mean you know people who commit "uh crimes that they" i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh
sw4830A-ms98-a-0046 214.976250 216.462125 "uh-huh"
sw4830A-ms98-a-0052 254.312250 256.922750 "no rea[lly]- not really"
sw4830B-ms98-a-0002 0.145000 2.342875 "no you can start" [laughter]
sw4830B-ms98-a-0045 210.140000 215.877875 "that was absurd" [laughter] there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
sw4831A-ms98-a-0003 23.144875 32.130875 "is to be in a situation where you" you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do
sw4831A-ms98-a-0022 178.487625 192.049125 and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly "or if your management doesn't think that"
sw4840A-ms98-a-0047 218.620250 219.879625 "hm"
sw4840B-ms98-a-0016 94.251500 99.217125 and it's "now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and"
sw4840B-ms98-a-0017 99.217125 105.546875 "you know" it's it's becoming a a large responsibility but s[omeone]- someone has to pay for it and that's us
sw4840B-ms98-a-0034 235.292375 243.002625 i'll like to know like where my tax dollars are going too [vocalized-noise] i work hard "to get you know i like to know where it's going to"
sw4845B-ms98-a-0007 33.815375 47.413250 uh as far as "i'm concerned i- i guess i should do it but being lazy i don't if" if somebody made it easy for me to separate my trash and pick it up i would more than gladly participate [laughter] uh
sw4846B-ms98-a-0012 65.371000 70.473000 "you know that's not an issue but that's primarily you know where i end up getting it from"
sw4856A-ms98-a-0035 155.481500 161.386000 and how long had he been a[ppealing]- appealing "how long was that"
sw4856A-ms98-a-0042 208.203500 210.677875 "right right"
sw4856B-ms98-a-0018 132.155250 146.476250 yeah he was like um the the "the defense the defense they're were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when" when she was pregnant with him and so he he wasn't you know mentally competent or anything else
sw4856B-ms98-a-0029 195.367625 205.000000 the the the justice system in the United States is kind of like "the dog" poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it
sw4858A-ms98-a-0002 3.423125 8.376250 "i guess" um looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh
sw4858A-ms98-a-0052 265.137125 277.597250 uh possible and even popular to um [noise] criticize the government and they that pendulum started to swing um "may[be]- maybe even too far uh to the point where um"
sw4858A-ms98-a-0053 277.597250 289.561250 um supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional [laughter] from the Vietnam war on "and that tradition is still i mean it's dying now but it's still alive" as opposed to
sw4858B-ms98-a-0011 69.086250 77.526500 but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and "every now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come" back and you know
sw4858B-ms98-a-0025 211.114000 214.007125 "we weren't prepared for"
sw4858B-ms98-a-0027 217.311000 228.465375 uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad "and it was a it was a traditional"
