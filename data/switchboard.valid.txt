yeah my uh my grandmother is hers is physically she is in not too bad of shape she is in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh she is uh alzheimer is i guess
oh yeah
no not at  all  pretty cheap
i think i  i  i ii have
just go ahead and quit the wondering and and
i think there should be more control as like uh like maybe waiting periods and things like that you know uh
as i uh went along when i started uh at first i had to uh i did not have to use my arms all that much to uh you know get the heart rate up but then after about uh
you know someone who who really has no remorse
so i refuse to have one in the house yeah
 very much so 
so but anyway yeah this topic is it is a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that is the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling
and you were on a jury with some heinous you know criminal who had you know just wiped out an entire family
and as they and as they go to the next one i just keep the  that is why i have so many different levels of pcs around at the moment
noise where you would catch crappie my my neighbor has gone before and and done that but
you know ii have ii have thought about going ahead and getting something like american express where you have to pay within thirty days
and i think that is one of the things that makes me shy away from uh imports
has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically or
turns around and does it again
yeah well being in  in in baltimore see maryland is um is sort um is probably  liberalism  is a is a hub of liberalism  you know compared to the country uh you know very um
oh how neat
yeah it gets sort of hard and then uh they get information from people and their attorney is not present and they ca not use it you know because_n they just assumed that the guy was you know tortured or beaten into uh giving his confession
saint louis is trying to get a team uh baltimore is trying to get a team and there is some other city i am  wanting to say raleigh durham but i am  not sure
you know we have just as we have a right  a duty to pay taxes
yeah that is probably a vocalized noise a little bit under what it is for this time of year i  i think i have not seen the weather  the news  the weather
yeah yeah transfer  yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it
sorry i roped on volvos then
yeah that is good i i like uh we have cable i really like watching the old nick at nite shows you know where you get to watch dragnet and mister ed and
yeah we usually just saturday  saturday  uh sunday afternoon
later i guess uh the last few years that i was at home noise my mother and father got a dog and i learned to really appreciate dogs as well they are totally different types of pets but um
well the primary thing that i do uh is go around and uh collect uh collectibles that are purchase collectibles and uh and some antiques uh go to a lot of garage sales and estate sales
and it is uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town
you know and and all these systems of where you can like
right right not just overhead 
what what kind of testing do they do when you went
to to get a death sentence because you ca not plea bargain what the sentence is going to be you can plea bargain what you are guilty of but
oh how nice
can you get like a a student discount type of thing or
as well as good long term and short term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs
oh my
yeah well may have been you know i am  not saying that that is not the case uh
yeah so we are you know net we are doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then we are doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt
oh sure i mean it is  it is  it is indicative across the board that we wei have done something wrong
so i am  not sure that it makes too much of a difference although we did find that like down in texas um at ut you know down in austin
you know we get over in the over the hundreds in the summer but it is it is not it is a dry heat and it is not really
yeah i do i own a um i own an i an x t clone it is a samsung and uh with a hyundai monitor monochrome monitor that i just keep at home for work
what  oh okay  maybe i will call you back after  after the recording is finished
they are at home um our oldest daughter is going to be a senior at smu
it is an eighty nine and i bought it uh
you know if if if you are not involved then you do not have a problem with it it should not it should not be any an issue for you and and and eventually the people that are actually
uh do you have kids
uh my husband is been unemployed for a little more than a year so wei have kind of uh
and so they get her off and at the very end of the case after it is over he is talking with her and he figures out that she really did do it after all a uh after he got after he got her off
you went to galveston uh
that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um noise planes
well you are going right down my list uh the first thing that i always talk to students about is the academic program because if we do not have what you are looking for it is not gonna do you any good no matter how bad you wanna come here
yeah that
and the problem is that
in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats and they are crying
where is that
uh it was wonderful i mean it was just incredible how much simpler it is than what you know i guess we just all have this mind set that oh this is so hard and we ca not do this
but that is the {politicalness} of trying to not create any new taxes
in kilometers and you you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour but any
well it it it is the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and
um for what we get we are paying too much i would say
yes it is really kind of sad and that we would go all the way to iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between jerusalem and
along with your garbage can uh you can put out newspaper you can put out glass you can put out aluminum cans you can put put out certain types of plastic material
and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive
and you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then i just fix little individual cups for them and they have the garlic bread and it makes it a real nice looking
right uh huh uh huh have  yeah have you ever um tried pappasito is
and i drove through atlanta uh couple of weeks ago and it was unseasonably warm
for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools
yeah you can appeal now in north carolina for almost  almost a period of twenty years
is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
and uh they are trying to to unwind
you know and  an i i think that u
prisons all my life and i believe if you do not have a punishment befitting the crime there is not any deterrent 
noise i  i think both uh by deliberate um vocalized noise i mean mistakes  mistakes of omission or uh noise or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal view point that they have
yeah i think they are starting to realize but i i just do not think they have the resources if you were to compare uh
it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think
any wrath or uh it is it is occurred so many times that
 yeah  yeah really does well do you think wei have
you say she is a programmer also
oh no no i am  i work for ti
because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them_n because they know that they deal and sell them_n  yes my father is very shrewd with them 
yeah lawn it is a forty year old house so we are doing a lot of refurbish work and uh yeah painting lawn gutters you name it  all kinds of stuff flower beds
so he uh
to operate yeah
i will be missing him then but vocalized noise
were  you mean every  they are they are everything a politician should be
okay you you are vocalized noise you are from california right la area
is uh is tie um
this man and his wife it it is a trial by jury but it is really going real ragged i do not understand how they are doing it
well sometimes you do not have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well family is tied up with
home to me would be a the very last resort you know it
um  requires a little more research that kind of thing so that is why i say it probably most  in most cases i would think it would come  the outcome would be better in most cases not always but uh
i try to whenever i can ii have always been a a i guess a product of a handyman father
feel really quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here because they are coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they are coming from the middle ages basically and they are being plunked down in plunked down into america
and that  that is about all he had going for him or still has for that matter
that will come some day when i
was she was her show big when you were in school since you have not been out that long
and we had x rays every year we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least
um hum yeah we went uh we took the southern route and went went through uh uh the grand canyon again and we stopped at uh
uh i think with um noise
that is one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i
for
yeah when when i mentioned ii have done this camping out of the car ii have actually done of the situation just like that but what is interesting is it is through texas instruments
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the ca/class class in an uproar and you are not at liberty
right you do not think
the guys average guys ca not really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh
they remember lots of good times and um we would still hear frequently from
i know uh target has their program to make kids more aware of it and
i i do not think it ever will really i maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest
all along the gulf coast from i guess from galveston to mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know there is part either as part of or separate from
delicious though i love it
oh i agree i just i i think we got once we started economic aid over seas we have really
the viewpoints differ
where is bob or what about bob
noise and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have
but on the other hand at least we are noise we are powerless in a lot of ways but then there is so many other countries that i am  glad i am  not in
american and one of them was metric
so i would i would have to say i think that the j j boys have done well 
understand we are doing care of the elderly right
yeah i understand that
oh yeah i  i guess there is a lot to to think about when you are trying to make that decision
marvelous health clubs too that you know you can use their facilities
yeah it is
as the income tax what is not fair is paying in the city you live in right now we are living where there is a reciprocity
and when they were coming home i was going to work
uh theyi have uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
well i i will i hope you will find him you most likely will
but i like to um noise
and how weird those cases get
and uh so and sundays uh we usually have all of our kids are over on sunday so you know we do not get into that except that sometimes we will get into the home videos
yeah or a barbecue or something like that yeah
oh i see uh huh so you have came to california though do you have family 
<b_aside> i have no idea he did not broadcast thank you uh huh <e_aside> i am  sorry go ahead
been on a real barbecue kick lately
when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed  and  realize that that is true so it is uh such a responsibility
because_n uh i know i  i  when i was younger and uh growing up with dogs i did not like cats at all i did not want anything at all to do with them
and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh
oh my god  well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
and i see it but i do not see so much that i can recycle like i say it is a lot of different type paper and cardboard i am  not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper
and uh it is well it is not that they came in it is they were conquered by the germans noise and then the russians even took it back from the germans and never bothered to give it back you know so that is a a little different situation
 well what is it for um new year is lot of people make ham and sauerkraut
oh wow um hum
you know it was so funny when i was when i was reading the things and they said you know checkoff different categories that you could talk about i thought food i could talk about food  have you not eaten yet tonight
yeah really that is television i do not know in general on this project we are suppose to talk about  that so i mean i am  that is okay do not vocalized noise i mean i  i i always digress
yes it is i i agree with you that they are starting children so much earlier on things because
what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer
my goodness well that is fascinating gosh
see i joined uh when this
right down there
you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so um i keep
uh we are just uh going through uh uh well there is a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water
and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i am  trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they do not do that in the newer houses now we do not the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white
uh mandy philip  uh nichols amanda nichols she plays i do not even know what she  you know a number we have not gone to a game  we were always gonna a game and we have not so
no and um my fiance is about an hour of dc and that you would not catch me dead down there
no oh no oh well take care
uh well it is further west of me
we have had highs of seventy two
i think i see it more with with that generation than i do with like our generation
tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps it is unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um
i am  in for it we rent a lot of movies so we we often sit around and say what movies should we rent and we  do not know
it is it is been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it is recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing
um
uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can
i did not even i did not even i have been
no  i just what can i say i just
we may have covered a uh a minuscule portion of politics today 
yeah although i guess it is your you want them_n to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
actually i have nine acres  and uh for many years i grew sweet corn
um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system noise
yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh dances uh silence of the lambs
 yeah but but people  people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar
they are apartment buildings one and two and three bedroom places uh be like you know
we are really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully
and do you fly into camgonias or the other one down there down south
you know if if they have completely changed  vocalized noise the place has completely turned that much around to where they are not you know not what they used to be uh  vocalized noise
well i was driving down six thirty five at the um coming from north dallas
as far as hard line laws dealing with criminals we do not have them in this country anymore we have situation ethics
so you have three cats
and and the one person i know that has one they they feel guilty she has this continual guilt trip that she is not doing the right thing and so
i stopped worrying about money and uh never have worried about money since then
well do you all have a what kind of grass do you grow up there do you grow uh bermuda or rye or
and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people
but uh it is supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties
so it is gotten to the point where um yeah automatic  automatic teller i only had the card and it was on my own personal account and it got way out of control very fast
took on a full time job well almost full time
that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick
absolutely i have had it for about two years now and it is uh
his check once a month pays all the bills my check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of  thing and it works out real well that way so we do not run into a lot of problems
is that right ooh
so i know a little bit about it not a whole great deal
i mean yeah
um open the almanac one day and it just has murders of by by guns and you look and you look at european countries and and it is like six eleven four and you get to the us and it is four thousand
uh after the what uh was it the king james version when the committee
uh i  i do not know my feeling is that uh certain jobs that when there is uh immediate threat to life and limb um if should somebody be under the influence of drugs
um to the first to to kidnapping and so we went through the second part of the trial because_n in texas there are two parts first of all to find if they are guilty or innocent
and you know i will watch that some if i am  reading or doing something else you know with him and uh but other
that is how we get caught in this uh sort of a catch twenty two
of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation but of course that is restricted choice so
and so um a lot of the moneys is not put into that and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and um
i do not know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from what comes over the border from us
oh yeah they they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league uh so it is like i said spending money does not guarantee you uh winning a pennant
i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that i do not go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know suits and stuff you know
in in complete uh advance of any notoriety
hm
oh i will bet
the way they are running it now they are have  you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we are not under a recession so there is never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we are running so
you know controlled  controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person
four door yeah and very very comfortable car big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it and i must admit it is you know if if if uh
do you have you tried mother mesquite is
yeah and get that youth back
that is probably true without being laughed at uh huh yeah i am  not ii have never i laugh at the wardrobe my father in law wears golf clothes and it is the only time he puts on those funny clothes yeah he does not wear those in the back yard or casually around
yeah it yeah but you know i am  sure you are familiar with that living here we go we go through enid you know quite a bit we go to tulsa from time to time and my my parents live in southern illinois so we drive up there and
uh take that as a challenge which is the way most teams naturally  you know naturally do uh and and just go out and and not give anybody a chance to beat them_n so
but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that there is a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is they are they are on
i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as perry mason and ironside and murder she wrote and columbo all of those uh are my  my favorite kinds of programs
yeah it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it you  give it to one person you are letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong
she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done
yeah so uh how long have you lived in north carolina
the british novel so it is it is really quite interesting i have not got too far into it yet
to uh the present  the the last summer we had i think we barely what cleared a hundred
okay well so
and and they have to
you know i think he uh he could  should  he could have taken more chances this year
i  i  i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background the history of our country has been inches and i do not think there is a big advantage in going to the metric system
five to seven and they are vested after their first year
well you know all about them_n then well tell me about it
everywhere  everywhere  america could be recycled
i would not trust them either you know i would not trust them to send  to send a story about the united states to their people correctly
is to protect those who actually did not commit the crimes all be it it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal
i mean and of course it is institutional food and everybody hates it and it is so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight  it it is really it is bad thing
i do not work with perfect people anymore than anybody else does but i can handle the imperfections that i am  around i  i could not work in the in
well you know a chocolate mousse recipe
has been uh broadcasting
so slow i guess they are stoned on the stuff or something
and all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper marinade
everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure and
what goes on
um anything 
well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living
i hate shoes
yeah because_n uh that just that does not do a lot for them_n i mean it alleviates your problem but it does not do anything for them
okay yeah me too you  well you too bye
for the home games but the  the thing is there is like eighty six home games per year
and what you find out is there is one evil is the same as the other here you do not there is no occupational tax but it is a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going
uh i feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another
i just i  i i do not see it
i mean you do not register for college there they doing that all over the phone now down here at the big at the big schools now what city are you in
um when  you know when they were coming up i i did not sew but now ii have ii have learned how to sew so i am  well i am  i am  still learning how but i am  getting  and i am  getting much better at it and i
i was dumb i was in uh florida for a week
tried to uh win a lot of money for the junior achievement uh organization but that is the only thing that i would you know be allowed to do
my sister lives out there my sister lives in piedmont
yeah phd in human factors
job market
it is a pretty rough area we are over by fair park
working within their party of of the state or national level to get things enacted
yeah that is that is good point so
oh it sounds like your kids are  doing  stuff so are are you a teacher i gathered you might be a teacher
one very old fat cat  prissy and that is why pat wo not ever let me have a party at my house 
well i think they actually do some of that but again it is the cost the cost of processing that it just
the uh schools like that that where you got a lot of kids who are basically uh
i just heard something about moving recently about moving um
now i did not even realize that at all
plus you know you may be you know doing a you know a a guilty verdict but it may not be you know may be for technical reasons 
and but this year we are not going to be taking one for several reasons but vacations we really enjoy i think wei have been on three cruises
i i do not think there is going to be many abortions but i do not know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion
okay
and then we went to uh the western caribbean which is uh port uh cancun cozumel
but i i do not know i think everywhere they just need to uh sit down and hire some uh vocalized noise people the grunts as i call them like  myself to tell them yeah i mean
yeah there are a lot and and how about_n uh any appliances ii have had that happen with sunbeam  no i am  disgusted i have a sunbeam beater that wei have taken back three times and sunbeam always had a good name
and you know we should not we were made differently however you come to that conclusion we were
yeah and i think the peace corps is great too because uh it you go to different countries and you see
that that was an awful three years afterwards you know of recovery and the difficulties
and the the camera man on the news crew held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by
has kind of the same sound over and over and the other thing i do not like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you ca not understand what the lyrics are
well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it would be great that we went to it
as as the years go by they run surveys to see how many women are ceos or on the boards of major companies and the number is creeping up very
and um he is blind and he has seizures you know i mean he is just like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people
um they were where i came from in uh dallas noise yeah so uh
when when  when  when it first uh you know when i first tuned in on that i you know it is one that is i think it was somebody was just {scariously} just just ripping the hell out of someone  another person and i and everybody was you know making noise in the background and then he was 
oh that is great
and it you know so if strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the vocalized noise uh just
well i think they should they should limit the senate to one term one six year term
brothers and sisters so it was a large reunion of of of of that group uh from that {descendancy}
right see when we take pe you have to dress in the in pe clothes but it is  it is issued to any one that wants one that is in the university
right and you make more money but it goes away anyway
no it is not the same
noise yeah
then it makes it real difficult and this is this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that that uh you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs
i you know i am  i am  tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day
i have an aunt who lived on her own  until she was well in her nineties and then she she got sick and she ended up in a nursing home
in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere it is really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where i do not have to uh
uh why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees
but it is still good it is still uh uh you know it is you do not really miss anything but i do  i do enjoy uh since the the gulf war uh listen to cnn radio too
and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um
do they really
uh near here and uh so but the houses around here there is five five houses on my street for sale right now
uh i think the company still exists what they used to do is they used to
they still had uh it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in
and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we do not have to work harder
they had a few more restrictions there
no i ca not either noise i really ca not um
but that takes too much planning
yeah well um i can just tell you like you know from my dad and my fiancee like my dad well there is twelve kids in my family
if they do not have good french fries you know if it is one of if it is a place that has other things if it is not that then we go to chinese food you know i order
well i do some oh some needle crafts things hobbies sometimes some cross stitch um
um oh well  noise
um attitude about exercise otherwise it becomes a chore and a task and and you you think of it as work and um
i just going to say nineteen eighty four is come and is come and gone but it is here
uh once a week twice a week
utah portland boston and detroit
uh i watch a little bit of everything i like to tune into cnn  to cnn because uh and you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on everything in about five or ten minutes i think news today um
hello   i  was i was thinking about our topic for the  night  um noise immigration problems noise we have immigration problems and what do do you think about it 
they should be though
that inspects it before it is turned there ought to be an inspector  inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they did not put the oil in or whatever i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh
and uh it is amazing how these things work one of my most um amazing  amazing things is to me is that what appears to be the major part of the work basically putting the structure up happens very quickly
well unfortunately very little uh much less than what i need to
oh really oh now that is surprising
well that is a that is a skill that she can use for the rest of her life so  might as well start now huh 
and it was placed in a actually it was placed clear closer to my neighborhood but it was on the right side of the street
it is they are kind of built on a catty cornered instead of right side by side so you do not actually hear anybody next door to you
uh we get counseling and uh i think part of our pay is docked if we are first time offenders
and it was just a real problem uh so we had to do a bond issue and and um
and uh pardon me i am  just sort of putting away some things from dinner now  in the background but we um we
uh huh but i  i am   not  good  enough  for  that
i never have either
oh that is good size
and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the soviet union i do not blame them either
oh yeah always got to have those
i mean people like i vocalized noise it is been shown  i mean like the arab societies and stuff end up uh having noise effective  effective
and uh i think i am  uh most happiest with my most familiar foods that i know are successful
in in many ways uh very liberal very similar to new england though pennsylvania and new york uh i are not actually as liberal maryland is a very liberal uh
 yeah
actually when i was younger i was a cardinal fan too remember jim hart
you know which is popular with the kids and and she says oh and you know uh i would not put the gel in my hair you know in other words you are to borrow a suit  two or three piece suit
yeah that is nice so is your husband a singer
um we went there for a conference we went to we stayed in houston for a couple days and then we visited a cousin in dallas just for a day you know and
noise well that is one view  and you know and
extra to go around uh long term is
noise and uh yeah i do not i do not need to pay for the glitz i will let somebody else uh have the showroom shine enough and i will pay for the rest of it
oh yeah i uh like like you i have not done it in quite some time
the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts
i ca not remember i am  sorry 
and and that is exceedingly expensive
he he is yeah  we bought the cat for him and so he is he is been the one that you know spent the most time with him
i do not know if that contributes to the problem
um however i if it were not for our needless uh noise competition with japan i i would i would think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace
it really chips really easy
do do they test you at right now at work too
um hum and we do not want our kids to to grow up thinking that that is what you do with your spare time
noise yeah but a lot of times it is not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in in responsible positions noise have not uh
yeah well it  it is it is uh you know it is like i was watching siskel and ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies
i think those old cars
yeah but
noise i mean this nonsense that is coming through now about uh uh lowering
you know it it because it it is it is spreading so rapidly
yeah  that is correct turtle is very good that is the other thing wrong with the poor turtles 
to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the the more more urban i mean less
and they had that on last week and that is really kind of something to watch uh it is on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
a two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh
and and uh uh transcontinental or um  um  um  um  interstate
um most of my hobbies include three  three little girls
yes so that must  that is before your time your parents might remember if they were here then
oh north dallas
is the uh the standardization and to have some hundred percent insurance that the test that is given

yeah uh
i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver is license when i was young when i was sixteen
not what the the norm would like them_n to do
oh i do not mind music that is noise difficult to listen to but uh the the uh
um not people that are you know necessarily good friends even though that has happened too uh it it is almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence you know when  if you decide to go back to work then
and you know you  you wonder where are the parents in all of this
so and i also uh my father works for ibm and we came up here we well we came to the united states in nineteen seventy six seventy seven
um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings i belong to presidents and uh ii have got a routine for every morning of the week and i do not work out on saturday or sunday
it uh it it it is
that is okay wei have been married eleven years and um we went through that after about five years of marriage my old tv that i had from college when we got married finally went out and we went we made it for about almost eighteen months without a television
and um there lots of opportunities that you can take advantage of there are community colleges here you can take for just practically nothing um they just offer so much for i feel like what we pay in our taxes that i do not mind paying them at all
yeah see i come from a catholic church background too
and what would you do what
yeah it is it is uh you know where the little bridge is on north oak cliff boulevard yeah we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there
and i feel pretty strongly about it i do not mind being drug tested and i do not feel the employees should
yeah um hum
and uh it is funny because_n kvil back when i was a teenager was an am station i think yeah and uh it used to have like the top twenty top forty all the time you know
i do not know whether
both either one yeah um ii have read lots of books i really like let me think um noise have you ever heard of a book called the hiding place
oh i know  by the phone and all that
and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son but my brother and his wife live in nevada my daughter lives in colorado one of my nephews lives in new york city one nephew lives in memphis
so at least from that i noise realize the importance of it
for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them like manson who is come up
probably  i would say five or six
uh it is just a shame to me that  that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well being
i would encourage it
uh i like to think i am it is it is been a while now 
measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds
so i kind of feel like i am  supporting a lot of people and that it is just gonna go into a hole  i do not think that i am  gonna get anything out of it when the time comes from
um i do some little bit of woodworking well i used to i i do not have the equipment here we moved to dallas about a year ago and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment and i did some of that um here ii have mostly done things that i can do strictly by hand um sewing
from the other team and he said noise christmas came early this year  so yeah
and me  i am  trying to think of the only other show i watch vocalized noise
they are kind of in between right now they are they are not
and they i believe they give discounts on  on drinks if you have this cup so that is kind of incentive
how did you get into this
huh
um hum well i think that is like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people do not they are not cracking down they let them back out on the street they do not really take away their license they do not really make sure they ca not drive anymore
is so careful about noise recycling and so i
and not anyway well   i guess i better let you go
youi have read that one before
 yeah yeah just because they are grandparents just  yeah just because they are grandparents that does not automatically make them_n a good child carer
i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon which is one of the major fluorocarbons  chlorofar/chlorofluorocarbons  chlorofluorocarbons
on the dash and and the the buttons are so small to push and gm does not seem to do that i kind of like that feature
more like embroidery or something
right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music
how about investing in the sun well nobody wants to pay twenty five cents a kilowatt hour i do not think uh i probably would not mind if it really came down it would  vocalized noise
but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from noise plano to dallas
uh we live in plano um and where are you
you know when you are in trouble and you need someone  you know someone to babysit the kids sure
 yeah do you hear the dogs in the background here okay they are
government and everything then
well i i got a stopwatch here
yeah  yeah so um it was just really interesting if that is
noise yeah my wife and i we have we have two cats um one is real nice but the other one is uh
that does cut into your reading time a lot
but i think that taking kids to a probably people that take them_n to uh preschools and day cares full time
and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at vocalized noise mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing is not all it is cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think we will probably see this swind/swing pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit
well uh noise there is a couple of things that ii have heard uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you would have to do uh
well i have noticed a lot uh more women is roles at work which i like in management
but it is always the rich person that gets into government that has uh the money to advertise the money to do  to do this there is no more abe
and we keep thinking about that you know because_n she they get less alert and they do not care and ii have seen some of these elderly people on tv you know the ones from florida that just run into people and they do not even understand what happened you know
digestive tract and they die
oh good heavens  not me  i avoid the sun 
it is kind of frustrating
with lots of kids you do not have lots of money for recreation well that is fun so um
you know they are water
i  i watch very closely their activities when i see them and like and i can tell when they are speaking more clearly the next day and and when they are understanding situations  more carefully
oh you
well our problem is that you know a trip to six flags or disney world or uh disney land or god forbid disney world would take forever
that that is what would just really kill me i would like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things i would like to know there is a lot of interaction and
the peace corps pays it does not pay well it is not top wages
well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of
and they just uh vocalized noise i think they have a good head on their shoulders i think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that ii have encountered
huh well i guess what we have is like a flex  what they call a flex benefits plan where you
changes as uh as perception  my perception changes of of what uh i am  getting gypped on  this week or this month uh uh
which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah paul simon well you know really that is not world music but what  what paul simon is doing i think is is is is great because he is
he will be okay yeah yeah ii have heard that they were expecting some layoffs but
uh of course we are  we are not we ca not consider getting a brand new cadillac because_n those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when they are three years old they are the price already drops in half
yeah  yeah i do ii have lived in in the dallas area here since i was like four so uh it is i do not know rural an urban area i guess whatever i do not know what i am 
yeah ii have been on the rowing machine at uh president is and uh i i like that
that is true it will be interesting and it will certainly be different noise
okay our last family reunion that we had was with my father is family
i think this year we just paid like ten dollars and and then they sent have started sending out a news letter on people and and um you know somebody is gone to a lot of work and theyi have they are doing a real good job and
and uh i thank god every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into
it really makes you wonder what other lists you are on that have been made uh public that you do not know about
but i have been in a situation uh recently where
the people who come across before they are citizens owe owe the children education and all that uh
i think that i should have a right to own a handgun not a automatic semiautomatic
but even then you did not see them wearing slacks too much and i really you know there is some nice pantsuits out and and i would not have minded  minded you know wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold
no
sounds interesting uh huh yeah that is great
yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um
well what do you think
no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the affixing  affixing  affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature
well i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence
um i live in texas now where are you
and so he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard  for like fifty dollars which he did and then
i do not know whether it is or not
there is another one that has came out in the last few year it is not the seville  the seville is totally different no the auto show they had fantastic looking cars so uh
it depends on who you call on in my business if i call on the noise the jc penney company here in dallas or say someone say sears and roebuck in chicago then i wear coat and tie if i call on just uh noise a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual
of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments they will you know they will do all right but a lot of them do not unfortunately
other things like you know your records with
uh ii have been real impressed with that you  you and i did not realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now
kind of the wheeling and dealing type thing and it is just it gets really fascinating  i did not think something like that would catch my interest but uh the way it is written and everything it is excellent it just really uh it is well worth reading
well i like the classics too uh i think that there is a lot of
is
but theyi have got all these caution signs now on fish
oh well i guess retirement that kind of thing which i do not worry much about  so
uh not at all in fact i am  graduating from college in about a week and this past semester ii have taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials
noise we did uh
very good i bet it is pretty over there
you know you just are tempted to give in to that and it costs a lot of money to do it too you know it adds up and it is not healthy and
oh okay
little prejudice of course
hopefully will go through
pretty hysterical so i  i like to watch comedy i mean you know that is something but i am  not real up to date on what is going on now i  i guess i have my old favorites that i
when when you are raised that way vocalized noise
there is a uh a couple called um oh i am  going to forgot his name now uh dirkson
they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so
yeah i have two nieces and they they they go melt some chocolate chips  go buy me some strawberries
how far west have you been
well when  it is it is very easy when you get a topic  you get on a topic that you know you enjoy and
with no gel in your hair you know and that would she made it pretty clear during the interview  you know the the first interview how they were supposed to dress for the second interview you know
noise retirement they kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then noise the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that
yeah exactly and
but you know i am  not so totally hung up on that that i would not buy something else how about you
noise you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in dallas there is a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um
um i think my favorite show is hunter and i i like the old series  series better when um
squash or something like that noise plant one of those and it takes up your whole space 
the possibility exists for for these sorts of
because i i i think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being taken out of the air
uh wei have done them_n for about fifteen years
probably things that that there happen every day and we do not even notice them until someone videotapes them_n
and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them_n in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was uh quite a drag because um we got them_n in our house and
i see i see well little  little bit different i think though it was much slower and uh
just the degree itself
because i went there many times and i never i never saw a riot
they will tell me they will reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it is the same thing you know but
oh yeah well those should be good albums
and that is always been a little bit of a tradition that wei have had now this year it is been was hard with our son now being in college so this was one thing that we um were not able to do this year but we did that for ever 
it is like a hundred dollars a month
the area itself uh the fort worth dallas area um has
and while we are talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny
yeah who did not is not that sad
if you add the um uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun they  people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they ca not get the tax bill passed no matter what happens
seems like it uh the place wei have been living at it is uh we are we are just leasing in
and put it on baskets it is real attractive and i vocalized noise i have not done one but i bought the things i need and uh my daughter is mom
i know i i did that for summer so i can i can vouch for  that
and left me with with the brand new puppy and i had to work twelve hours that day
yeah it is it is to bad because it is um i mean
you know i do not think money is gonna take the place of intelligence or uh problem solving skills uh i think there
it  it  it yes okay and  and our company has taken that and gone all the way say okay uh first off
well uh i probably tend to fall  come down on the side of of being for it but i  i think it
yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need
oh yeah that was great
booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling
so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine
yeah and you know there is some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them_n just want to go play
was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know um
oh wow
i do not know if it is even true that it is always unanimous because_n i thought there were cases where uh i do not know if it is the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve
is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon
and uh the amazing thing is wei have had the same santa claus and his wife have come for the last twenty six years
um noise the the team i live and die with actually is the red sox mostly die uh but um i  i go to the orioles since they are here and i you know i do enjoy them um i was out at opening day on monday um
so they were all real close that is tough that is a lot of time
painful but the the ti rec center has an aerobics program for for um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing
one of the worst crimes in my book and uh drug dealing hm
i am  more interested in trying to understand what is going on in the world rather than simply being aware that
oh okay i  i play that about six times a year and every year i hang my bag up uh if  if i get that five  or six and i swear
so that i can then find out the uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you
i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with
juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if it is first degree rape second degree  degree rape or whatever
like out of nowhere yeah
it kind of noise kind of down played compared to what you would like huh do you find yourself um
um hum well we only have one only one of our bathroom has a window in it so i am  hoping that um it wo not be too much of a a problem
and i think that it is not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed
noise well that is a really interesting tip and uh definitely something tom could handle doing that
it leads you to kind of say well i am  not going to take it out i am  going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way
i just you know you are ready to go at a i  i  i think it is really important
there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five  five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and
uh what do you mean by that statement do you mean they want the children  uh the teachers to keep the children longer than they are supposed to or are they vocalized noise to train them
oh i am  pretty much for it
you know i do not ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
uh huh bad knee 
i think they are really trying it is going to take years though i mean it is just it is that mindset
people be um the juries wo not want to convict a person because what happens if they are they are really innocent because_n once and you kill them_n they are gone you ca not like fix the problem so
had been uh
people there were saying that
uh have a lot of heavy industry but it is kind of uh all the industry has gone south and uh now the air force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh
secret storm though i think they were back to back on black and white okay i mean i am  just a youngster and i was like oh my gosh
most of the people who that i that i know about who really uh would
yeah yeah i am  the same way but the the evening news on tv it is it is really it is so short that you just uh i do not feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh mcneil lehrer report on public tv
 you are  kidding yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too
and they say well they are trying to deduce what he what he or she is so to see if it is a female they say well do you carry a purse and pat says no i carry a fanny  pack
sleeping with the enemy and flatliners those were the last two that ii have seen
i understand that approach that is what that is exactly what is happening in my family vocalized noise
take it easy bye bye
and a newspaper if i have time
you pay for something with a credit card you dissatisfied  are dissatisfied with it you take it back and they say sorry we you ca not take it back if you know you can leave it there and then just have your visa charged back
oh really
and now i talk to people that do so that is it is really interesting
well mainly because it is just uh at this point in life ii have had to be available to travel and we live in an apartment right now so um they are not even allowed here noise
noise did you hear the topic
you know um a push mower i mean it is electric of course um i i think it is not very old about
it is it looked very hard to do so we figured well just i do not think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but
we were not prepared for
and they get to the hospital and the doctor comes in to uh work on the injured child and says oh i ca not uh do that that is my child
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work um the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television and i enjoy that quite a bit
jobs
um i am  twenty
are you i do not do that oh i guess i will call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips you know and keep their arms up i do not do that
but then we have the same attitude when it is out there although this year we are going out they are going to have it at fort davis and we thought that would be
oh there you go okay
that is about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
home cooked mexican yeah yeah home cooked tex mex uh mexican restaurants where
all those good things and i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer
if if everybody bands together it is just like we need to get rid of these clowns that is serving in the office
uh they would prefer fresh stick veggies as opposed to chips and dips although there are some hard crust chips and dippers uh
i think they can read the price tag on the cans of food
so that people would use this stuff reuse  over again
yeah when you get down closer in to the newer track homes you find almost like there is no lot line at all they are built practically on top of each other
and it very very hard for them to accept that
oh mostly we catch carp if we are doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but wei have never caught enough to really have what you would call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh
um it was becoming quite disturbing realizing how many crack babies were  there were becoming you know out there in the educational area and
they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places
is not it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time
that is right but do you actually watch it and pay attention to it or is it more of a company
something like a noise uh state auditor or something like that before this position she was a state auditor
well i uh you know i am  not i am  not racist or anything but one of my another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the blacks are poor and therefore they do not have a choice but go in the military
man there is so they are i learned so many things that they they do they are into so many different things so
i think it is such a shame that
yeah seven yards of sand i got to shovel it all
there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting those the james thurber books for children
uh i can see some some potential changes that
you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off
in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh
i  i might buy the motherboards from utah but then still have to pay some pennsylvania sales tax my apartment  accounting department will at the end of the month
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
 detroit is in that same uh that that same uh division
find out if she wanted to go
oh yeah now that one is a fun one that that is fun i know that sometimes ii have the one that is been hard for me is the one that the skidmores used to do at christmas time
uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my my personal feelings is that parents need to be taking more responsibility
and no lead gas was came to the pumps and and that is been done there is the lead pollution has that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked
and from west africa that is considered world music because it is not particularly using certain types of folk styles
what you can take and and what you ca not take and um
i pad the paint on
um hum and i think that uh uh i think by the year two thousand it we are going to see vocalized noise some a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men
whether it is your personal salary or whatever uh if your just making out a credit card application you do not need to put down
that uh i mean i it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i  i think i am  correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget is  is  is allocated now for debt payments
um hum absolutely and that i  i do not know if uh i do not know if everybody understands all the implications on that too even  even if you
no it was not on the way across louisiana we pulled off we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place
usually just camp near some stream or some lake
i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day and i like it just for the noise 
um
 i hear that one have you had any lately go out
yeah  i mean i  i definitely think that it is the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um noise
and hold them but when time came to direct their ability to make choices
have a lawn service there was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them what about you
uh what about steaks
well i am  on my second career currently and i am  i am  just too old to start a third
so if it comes to pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the us um you should go see it because it is really it is really outstanding
bryan what kind of music is does what songs does he play
health maintenance programs or one of whatever the type name is hmo uh where the
after you know it is after theyi have used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you
uh huh well uh we are kind of lucky i i am  uh
yes uh huh
but if we took these people off
uh no i have access to uh spell correction uh material i seldom 
that uh noise yeah they may say it is real bad
once you have something and it is like i was watching this program on tv yesterday in nineteen seventy six nasa came up with three d graphics right
uh graduated to um a honda and had that for a long time and then graduated to a volvo and then wound up with a honda again
um hum they sure are would not it be something to have a world series between dallas  the rangers and the astros 
tend to listen to most um i like the way they handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they will have you know five minutes worth of news every half hour
winding down or what
yeah and the truth that is brought out is uh as i say when ii have heard about you know the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
yes those also um and then of course uh cans coke cans whatever
i formulated a pretty radical theory
they look like
yeah i have a cat now he just turned seven also  and he is i um got him in arizona noise and when i used to live there and he is huge he is eighteen pounds
yeah see i am  in the manufacturing field i  just home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags
back when they were in saint louis
uh huh especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like you know pro life and and pro choice  uh  pro choice in in the in the special interest groups maybe uh noise like amnesty
well that is happened before but we like good uh we  we are we like mexican food
really i know the female version of john lennon is but
it was the one where he was a defense uh not defense he was a prosecutor   prosecutor and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the the da is office
yeah yeah wei have you know and uh let me think
and then
but uh we like uh we do like international food so we tend to i like cooking  we like indian food and uh i love italian food and
you know the doctors the time the hospital vocalized noise everything
yeah
considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the p a t staff which i belong to
and he would just look over everyone is shoulder and say hey your your gun is not unloaded you know you have to unload because_n you walk out there uh in this particular range uh uh in fort worth now the other ranges it is always somebody else but
you can go to the buildings and not go in if you are not
um in august
so they try but you know very few actually go
but um we we are on the southwest side of houston we do not have that much as far as uh any of the plants over on this uh the west  east side does
but it is a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it
public transportation
right the question becomes what do you do about somebody who testses/tests who test positive
and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown
well yes that yes i  i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was  positive  and i knew it was not you know that just really rub me the wrong way
and i just do not see it like that of course i always see pay the bills first and whatever is leftover that is what you have but um maybe a lot of people do not see it like that but i ca not stand owing
sure
oh yeah yeah we do not either neither one of us do
well i think it is long overdue uh i just you know there is so much difference in in the economies of the two countries i i am  not you know i have a problem uh
is that right oh well
in fact uh we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
you know was sort of a medium priced car with a  stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a chrysler um noise
and that did not help at all
yeah i know i know exactly how you feel but i  i also do not know  you know how  how can we get people to change it i mean it it kind of it kind of requires you know a company taking a risk and they do not want to do that 
certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come spring  come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal
one down here opened up i joined as a vip and the vip gives you uh
uh huh
yeah exactly you know john john singleton who is who uh made the film um noise boys in the hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men
okay
that is wonderful that is wonderful noise
oh i would too i would i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to to
well let is see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh
would you my uh noise my sister we went with them to germany and uh she would like to go to spain i am  not sure whether i would like to or not
it was it was
but then i have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
so now i know
um although i work in in through a hi tech industry type thing and and and which in large part survives on on uh on defense contracting you know so
that was a lot of fun but
that then really does not penalize  wind up penalizing the person that they went after who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us
um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors
to win you just have to spend it if it is necessary in other words if youi have got a player on your team who is helping your team then keep him there do not let him go away you know and i think that is really what is been hurting uh uh the uh rangers
yeah i will tell you i i was real excited when i first heard that i said hot dog they finally did it you know
it gets boring after a while but i do not go ahead
strange book beautifully written
yeah i do not know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean other other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something
i i i i do not understand where the priority is it is uh like in atlanta they have um they have mandatory catalytic converter inspections
okay i knew it was something like that and i thought jeez that seemed so severe for marijuana but then i thought or is that just because um
so we gave him to uh i do not know if youi have there is a place out here on it is called shorties lane out here in harrisville and they have um
let is see who was in fisher king
oh i would be too 
you know the death penalty and such
back by the garage that i filled in with and and it is filling in with with grass uh nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but uh
i think they waste what what  all the money that we pay
so they they needed an audible method of defining when brakes were needed so they came up with that
so that is the main point is that we are going ahead
in that even if they made that kind of money there is some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they um they would not be able to enjoy the
sections to it and they they present different sides of things
well we did not have any uh avid uh activities like that they  they were interested in a lot of things but nothing to quite that depth i guess but
well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care our kids are now fourteen and eighteen but uh noise and so you know you go back
uh huh and there is some that
well i do not know it seems like noise rolando blackman and and harper sort of carry the team they just
i would love for my girls to take piano lessons but wei have been unemployed for a while so i have not had a chance to do that so
well and eventually it is going to be not only the teachers  you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it is going to be the teachers
you might be well i think wei have used up as much time as we are supposed to anyway we are supposed to do five minutes and that was three minutes ago hey well thanks for the call yeah bye
i actually it is not  it is more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrent  is a deterrence to someone saying well i am  going to mug this guy right here but hey he
that is what this was yeah well let me go a head and push one okay okay
and uh did you have any problems with that or
oh ii have done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh
you know companies that do at least go into it i would like to see subsidy by the government or something or {taxwise} or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular
yes yes
okay well it was nice talking to you okay take care bye bye
where at
uh you serve your prison term
you  you know that we do not really see or notice i guess but it just seemed like if if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system
it is  it is a red wine
probably around thirty five percent or more and that is that is you know that is me not making a whole lot of  money
you do it once in awhile and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it and then it usually comes on television within two years you know
uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
oh is that  right i bet the kids were happy
mostly uh something i like like true life
no no ifs ands and buts you know no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review it is just
oh well i i would like to learn how so it is one of my goals  i am  sure i will once i move out on my own
so i most of the kids here i you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they will say that they do not believe in it but then after i would say my point of view then they will say well yeah you know vocalized noise you know
in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened um
the um
yeah she is real good
and then the uh they take them_n to a special part of our dump where {composting} is
but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired
well that is true no we do get time and um i i read it pretty well you know i especially read the political news uh um i like to keep up with that but um
it is an interesting interesting thing you want to do i how is texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it
uh huh we always we had that bread that was uh um you ever seen the the starter bread i ca not remember what it is called they call it the um amish bread here but uh it is made with you just leave  leave it out
associations that was the primary subject that is how they obtain information about segments of society
even better than roger rabbit insofar as animation
and not being cared for yeah that is true well what did you do when you helped these people how did you what did you do through
i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep so i probably get oh thirty to fifty pages a day read
yeah well that is the way i felt when uh carter and reagan was running i liked carter as a president
what do you do
right right and um i was impressed with the fact that um
you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to
oh yeah that  those were laws are unusual you know
you know if you are gonna go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that  i  think  ii have  ever  run  into even even more so
yeah but wei have uh wei have done uh
because_n i do not  expect  to  be  traveling  overseas in in the future for quite awhile but i  i usually just read through the sections on on domestic stuff
so well i do not know it is it is interesting in case you did not know texas leads the nation in uninsured children thirty one percent of all texas children
and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there
i uh i i guess ii have had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues
but i think if
instead of six packs and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles  you  know  i  was  like  god  almighty costs more for the bottles than it did for the cokes
okay so you you were out of school  you went to school for awhile then quit then went back
middle class in this country
it is a really  uh i have trouble with it it is just a really ridiculous show i just hate it my daughter looks  forward to it  she  likes  it
oh is that right 
oh the synthesizers  synsi/synthesizers synthesizers and all of that
sherman texas  oh i am  in dallas i was just saying where am i calling you from yeah well then i do not know if you like the mavericks or not or
really i am  kind of open on food i am 
you know and uh i just uh we just have not and not that they i think they both would  would like it they have gone with their dad and uh he lives in arizona now and uh
i am  going to be there for them at least until they are in the second well until the baby starts
oh i love that show yes that is great
