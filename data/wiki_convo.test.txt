 thanks for the welcome message i will have a good read over the policies i have read a few of them before but i will try and get my head around them see ya around 
 sure if you like check out 
 hi there did you get my email the other day i was a bit worried that the size of the file might be rejected by your email server so i wanted to make sure you got it i havent heard back from you so i just want to be sure if you didnt get it i will break the file down and send it in manageable chunks please let me know 
 thats great im glad you got it thats all i wanted to know yes its great to see the statistics page is live again 
 thanks for the welcome message i see that you are also interested in f gulen article would you like to continue contributing it 
 i have received a lot of input on gxfclen and the gxfclen movement this last year mainly from leo zagami and you may be aware that he is on a crusade against gxfclens work of interreligious detente i still havent been able to read the article in sum nor appraise myself fully as to the past controversies over its editing i will maintain a focus on this material though and i may step into the process more fully in time __ 
 another question are the data if any stored on the hard drive after using vandalproof or are they temporary for the session only and nbsp
 some info is stored for example the local black or white lists and what your username is the data are stored in text files 
 thanks and nbsp
 im looking at your recent edits of 
 i was simplifying the details on what happened to the militants so there is less confusion i was making it more factual is that alright with you 
 by more factual do you assert that the cited sources were previously misrepresented __ 
 hi i was recently approved to use the vandalproof software and i was wondering how to use it do you revert changes the same way as you did without the software and how do you leave the user a warning i know theres these buttons at the top but they are codes im not familiar with can you help me out thanks 
 flagging so you will notice this message im out 
 the only reason that i put it at low is that we are currently working on a set of criteria for importance on our projects talk page but at present we are reserving midtop importance for those articles that are vital to poetry in english since our list of active members has fallen drastically over the past few months and we are trying to keep the higher importances for articles like 
 very well i will leave the issue at rest maybe some more discussion on this particular case will emerge in the future and perhaps then in a more developed context __ 
 most of the plants at my universitys garden are labelled 
 also i am only proposing this for well established species that havent changed their name classification in the past N to N years 
 i do hope so also please feel free to take up the matter on the projects talk page but my appologies for the lack of a concrete answer will also have to apply for the fact that you will only receive replies from about N other members 
 on another note tagging new articles will contribute also to the recruitment of new project members __ 
 thanks i could have done it myself but i have become a bit too involved in the dispute that i tried to limit my use of the buttons so it would not be viewed as admin abuse or something like that which reminds me my one year anniversary of being a sysop in almost here as i understand it you became an admin yourself recently congratulations and of course to your vandalproof software see ya around 
 no i totally understand and i think its quite professional of you to ask patiently for someone else to do this for you rather than doing it yourself and yes its been an interesting few days since being sysopped still have to get my support thank yous out and congratulations on your anniversary of sysophood 
 hi meco for the ministry of human rights article try adding info from to get it over the N dyk character count 
 excellent tips i have expanded the article now __ 
 i hope i did this right guillen is back as 
 first one indef blocked second one got N i tagged the first one as proven as i think given my history with this case its quite obvious that its a sock given his recent abuse of sockpuppetry im thinking that it may be necessary to lengthen 
 or 
 i will see if i cant get to it today __ 
 dday 
 thanks gow i wasnt sure what to do for that thank you for all the work you have done so far on the userbox project 
 can you dig up relevant references or write a draft in userspace i think either would help the drv case if johnN is blatantly wrong then redirecting the page would merely promote the opposite viewpoint having a scientifically supported article at the location would avoid any bickering about where it should redirect to 
 i dont think going into the festering matter is wise on this occasion i dont see why a simple disambiguation page linking to both 
 it will have to wait for a few days it seems __ 
 i have nowikied the categories on your sandbox page because it is not desirable for user pages to appear in category lists hope thats ok 
 certainly __ 
 i have requested the page be made editable i would like to move the old exopolitics article from your sandbox there with an under construction tag added i will have to do some major reconstruction to bring it up to snuff but its certainly a notable subject is it okay if i do this i dont really know what the rules are regarding using the article from your sandbox thank 
 well i had a willing administrator provide me with a copy of the deleted article and place it in my sandbox i personally think the smartest route here is to make a publishable version out of this before requesting unprotection of the salted article name __ 
 never mind that i didnt notice you already had the article up and running then all that is left is to make it impervious to afd nominations __ 
 desperatebree uses an aol account and for my sins so do i because of the dynamic addresses used by aol the block was catching me too so the consequence of freeing myself was that this user was also unblocked this is a problem that will persist unless wikipedia takes vandals seriously (ie no anon edits and new usernames to wait an hour before first edit 
 ohh i wasnt aware s or he was on aol well this will just complicate matters furthershes got puppets popping up everywhere and is quite an abusive user i will drop a note on an or i and try to get some input on this as im not sure exactly what to do nothing against you but aol is really starting to piss me off thanks for your response 
 check out pgks that checks for autoblocks does that help basically you just block for the normal length and then have to keep an eye out for autoblocks 
 yeah i have been using that with all of the other aol blocks i have had to do but its still a nightmare to have to do that every time a new sock pops up im gonna keep my eye on the user and if she returns to doing what she was then i will block again thanks for the note psN 
 it seems that there is some disagreement about that thus why your edits have been reverted id suggest that you post a message on 
 company names as usernames are not of themselves blockable i agree however when taken in conjunction with the creation of spam pages about that company its operations and staff then it becomes blockable 
 i think a warning and reverting would suffice to remedy this if the lesson is not learnt by that then we can block these were not bad faith edits and the user was a new user __ 
 no they are not bad faith edits which is why they are softblocked not hardblocked and free to start a new account with a username which is in accordance with the username policy warning and reverting wouldnt suffice simply because its the username itself which is unacceptable because its the name of a company and being used to promote that company the block notice tells them how to either create a new account with an acceptable username or to request a change of username for the existing account 
 hi my apologies but please consider this an official warning blp is one of our most important policies and restoring your personal or opinion that he dances like a robot as that relates to his personal character is not helpful please note that removals under blp are always exempt from N rr but your reinsertions are not you might want to review 
 as a second opinion from an uninvolved administrator i dont find your contributions meco to be all that helpful or constructive the comments were nothing more than original research unverifiable uncited and thus failed blp 
 and i noticed you are at N reverts note that by continuously adding in this particular passage can result in a block regardless if you have 
 there arent really any crit guidelines apart from state what they said i created my own template a while back to spice up it a bit as it can be dull but even that keeps getting culled by reviewers with each ga or fa they are not even allowing me synonyms in prose these days what has the world come to but to get to your point at first sight it looks good but after reading it im getting a disjunct feeling ie making readers jump from the feb N stat to the nov N award to the endofN awards and then back to the reviews from feb N that form part of the stat ultimately i think the way it is ie historical is in the end better so stat > +ve > ve > endofyear i appreciate the effort though if you have any other new ideas in general run them by me cos im slowly turning into a robot rbN and nbsp( 
 done although im sure they are they have expanded considerably like amg with allmusic allmovie allgame etc still never miss a chance to add a bit of irish charm rbN and nbsp( 
 as there is clear consensus on removal of your contents as a blp vio but you have readded it over several days i asked for help on ani 
 meco your personal opinion or mine matters not at wp unless 
 meco will you agree to not reinsert this offending material again this question is in response to so that you dont end up possibly blocked 
 it is not a blp violation and there is no consensus to that effect i believe the removal of the material and the above warning are not appropriate however it will become an issue if edit warring continues you dont have to admit you were wrong but an acknowledgment that you will not readd it should put this whole thing to rest the discussion is done the material is not a good fit for the main obama page and there isnt anything to gain by continuing this 
 i accede the assessment presented by wikidemon as i have just stated on wpani i refer to that entry also for my own perspective on the role of some intervening parties __ 
 no problems it really was my pleasure 
 thanks for your help hopefully we will get somewhere now or or 
 no problem good luck resolving your dispute 
 hey tim i think to get the most out of the google collaboration we need to make some changes to the process i have started a discussion on the project page 
 hey tim have some concerns with inaccurate taking of articles by the google reviewers have started a note on the project page regarding my concerns 
 for some reason vandalproof is freaking out and saying im not a moderator i assume you would have actually told me about pulling me from the list so i assume its some kind of malfunction 
 okay i tried reseting it again let me know if it works for you and yes you should still be a moderatori havent found a reason to turn on you yet p 
 heh still not working dont worry about it for now all i needed to know is that you didnt show me the door im on irc if you want to chat up your recent ubermop d 
 if you can get on irc i have a question about how to publically display my logs and stuff too bad i wiped my old files so im back to square one on revert countsnot that its a race or anythingmaybe d 
 if youd like i can reopen the case as new right now the case page is hidden in the depths of the closed cases category 
 very well i just noticed that you had contributed to a number of norwayrelated articles __ 
 why subst the lifetime template 
 it doesnt say that lifetime should be replaced by defaultsort though 
 you might take an interest in the discussion about that which takes place on the template talk page __ 
 i didnt remove anything __ 
 i will fix it __ 
 see 
 hm i dont think the evidence here is conclusive enough to block i will keep my eye on him but be sure to let me know if he continues it would be great if we could get a checkuser on guilien to confirm a couple of these and to find out where else he has sockg hiding but unfortunately 
 please check again its pretty conclusive now also the ip user 
 this was a message regarding our consensus to change the name to anaheim hills california but if it were to be changed again ti would also need to be protected from being changed back by angry editors at least for N hours please consider our comprimise that we have come up with 
 i will unprotect the article when protection is no longer necessary i will not condone moving it while its protected unless there is overwhelming consensus to do so otherwise i think it best to leave the article where it is currently and moveprotected i noticed the poll you started on the talk page today it demonstrates to me that there is not consensus yet nor has adequate time been given to determine consensus please just relax for a bit discuss your reasons and give it some time theres no need currently for rash action and im not going to go against the protection policy just because you believe the title to be better sorry 
 its really ok to assert on wikipedia that aliens exist 
 its ok to present groups who believe this without adding ones own opinion on the soundness of such beliefs __ 
 i didnt have time to change all the dates the original date format may be consistent within that particular article but is actually inconsistent with the N other years in norway articles i will get round to making it fully consistent with all other articles in due course 
 you do realize dont you that the format which existed uniformly before you began updating these articles is the one you are changing away from __ 
 i sent you an email 
 thanks for your note let me read it and get back to you 
 i saw your comment on 
 since the image does not in fact depict space ibiza the photo should not illustrate this article on the other hand the image was uploaded to wikimedia commons duly as it had then a free licence this can not be undone once released this way a more restrictive licence may not be applied certainly not when another party has already republished it under the original licence if you want the image deleted from commons you must go there since that is the common repository for all wikipedia and similar projects __ 
 thank you for the protection and history wipe i really appreciate it 
 no problem let me know if theres anything else i can do for you 
 dilip rajeev who has been editing on the falun gong article just violated the N rr rule again his N th revert is at this time N N june N if you are serious about enforcing the N rr rule you need to block him for N hours dilip has been warned many times and his recent edit was again done without a consensus 
 he has been blocked for N hours i would however like to point out that both you and 
 thanks for continuing to keep an eye on this page i decided to go out and have a life today and was afraid this might happen feel free to stop by when you have time and count again it wouldnt surprise me if somebody else violates N rr today 
 or me shakes head pointless edit wars they are more frustrating than the vandals 
 i didnt mean the computer company i believe theres an ngo or something akin in pakistan by that name __ 
 the people who work for it are not automatically notable too 
 true but its hard to tell when we wouldnt have anything except a redlink in any case there are many redlinks on the disambig pages and some discretion must be allowed for in such cases __ 
 is this a correct summary of your rationale to keep a poorly formatted and obvious vanity entry with no google hits for either person or ngo in a surname dab 
 thank you for blocking him or her it was really a nuance having to keep reverting those images 
 sorry it took so long he had some puppet who kept removing the name from aiv and finding log vandalism is a bit harder than standard edit vandalism hes actually now been indef blocked as hes the same user as another obnoxious vandal by a similar nameim going to go post on an or i to see if anyone has had similar problems with steppwolf vandals anyway sorry it took so long but im gladly we got him stopped for now 
 i indefd the message you dont think i have more screen names and a fair number of the edits look like a sock just thought youd like to know 
 oh okay i figured it must have been something along those lines but the contribs i looked at seemed well not vandalism at least thanks for your note probably should have spent more time looking at it 
 oops i didnt notice that i thought i only did what i stated in the edit summary perhaps you should have asked if i meant to delete what i did especially considering the edit summary before assuming bad faith __ 
 no assumption of bad faith this is a reminder 
 you are engaging in silly editorship i made one revert also your previous contact with me should make you realize that this line of behaviour is counterproductive __ 
 you unfroze the falun gong page yesterday and an editor named dilip rajeev immediately started a series of edits exceeding his N rr limit i blocked his reverts and exceeded my N rr limit as well you issued a warning to both dilip and i in response i stopped doing all reverts or deletions but if you check the history on the page you will see dilip resumed several hours later check particularly his edit of N june in which he deleted an entire paragraph claiming it was unsourced it is a pargraph we had discussed before and we had agreed not to discuss all source issues before making any deletions if your words have any meaning at all i ask that you block dilip now 
 yes i agree that he is well in excess of three reverts in one day but unfortunately i wasnt around when he did and its now been eleven hours blocking is a preventitive rather than punitive measure and so if hes refrained from edit warring in the last eleven hours i dont really see a need to block i will be watching though and thanks for your note 
 i have notified the author of the other article that it might make sense to combine the two hooks cheers 
 i have just realised that the two of you were talking about this already so please excuse my slowness in catching on too many user names to keep in mind 
 can you fix it 
 im not really on but i will just give you a quick response here old revisions contain personal information about katefanN deleteing and restoring only current version contact 
 contesting the noteworthiness of the nuadin was absurd again who the hell are you mr royal we are you the rep of noteworthiness the president of notability by your own arbitrary standard you are a nobody and yet you contest the notability of other while promoting yourself as someone whose opinion matters you are taking advantage of a silly rule to exalt your nobody self naudin is mentioned many times on 
 i have started an ani report about this editor please feel free to contribute 
 i may i was however considering their behaviour so overthetop that i simply cannot take any of it at face value __ 
 serpentdove has also started an 
 headsup appreciated its ludicrous __ 
 a couple of weeks ago you said you would give me the vandalproof source code any chance of this happening soon please be aware that my wikipedia email is currently down 
 let me know when your emails back up and i will send it to you sorry that i spaced it oh and please remember that i warned you about how ridiculously messy the code isbut it works 
 i have a secondary email address from googles mail service with this username you can send it there at the moment if you like 
 removed paranoia 
 thats correct 
 paranoia understood let me package that up and send it out to you as soon as i can 
 thanks very much im specifically looking for how you process the rss feed as this is nightmarish for me 
 i sympathise with your reaction and as you misread the afd for a prod which the present section header also indicates i understand why this happened from my perspective i merely considered the likelihood of an experienced editor removing and afd notice a remote one and i did not see any reason for checking if you were in fact an experienced editor who could have been assumed to have misread which template they were removing __ 
 hey no biggie its meant in good fun p 
 appreciate the links though they could come in handy __ 
 when you mentioned rss feed it brought another question to mind do you want my current inprogress source code where im working on a lot of cool dealios with precaching rollbacks and filters or do you want the source code for vN the new stuff is even messier and is potentially quite buggy but i find it a lot more impressive than my old code your callor i could send you both 
 eithers good 
 hi i have pretty much gotten used to using vandalproof but sometimes when i rollback articles a message will pop up saying the previous edit to this page was by the same user do you want to view all edits made by this user before rolling back then you either have to click yes or no im not sure what to do when this happens can you help me out thanks 
 if you click yes it will load the diff between the last edit made by the current user and the last edit made by the previous user if you click no it will simply revert one edit its probably best to review all edits by the ontop user as there may well be more vandalism by that user that you didnt notice in the current diff 
 yeah i forgot to remove it during that run my bad 
 lol yeah its no problem at allvery easy to correct keep up the good work 
 i saw that you all said you couldnt find any reliable sources for biographical data i wanted to know if you knew any setians satanists or others with libraries who might provide you with such references such as i have at my disposal or if this was a case of severely restrictive criteria for inclusion based on the individual wanting his page removed thanks 
 i am certain michael aquino is a figure notable enough for a wikipedia biography and if adequate sourcing exists i would help in maintaining and developing such an article i am not aware of any persons in my network that would fit those labels unfortunately __ 
 check your mail soon 
 thanks for your note checking it now 
 and again 
 just in case it was swamped by previous messages 
 you just changed 
 it was a typo i have fixed it _ 
 theres pointed commentary and theres trolling and 
 yes i realize that now __ 
 no problem cheers 
 and thanks for the very fast response to my request for protection you are page says that you are sleeping so you must be able to respond even more quickly when awake thanks for using your powers for good instead of evil 
 gawd i always forget to change thatwho knows how long i have been sleeping this time no problem at all and please feel free to let me know if you need help with anything else 
 hi this is a content dispute with good old wikistalking by 
 i never said anything about vandalism simply that you are both almost in violation of the 
 nope i will nominate it for good article status you can take care of the dyk nomination if you want to 
 i will do that as soon as i see your ga nom in place __ 
 im nominating the article to ga the only thing thats left is to rewrite the lead so you can nominate the article for a dyk if you want 
 question are you fixing the grammar problems on the folkvord page if so shouldnt you replace the banner with the underconstruction one 
 well im fixing some but i doubt i will make the thorough effort which is needed __ 
 what kind of grammar problems are we talking about 
 basic english spelling conjugation sentence patterns choice of words pretty basic but irritating sometimes confusing items __ 
 how about his lifestyle he bacame a father at N and married when he was N does that really sound smart to you 
 hj please tell me you removed what you just said because you know its wrong we are not ruled by a queen we are ruled but a prime minister personally i dont agree with the monarchy that does absolutly nothing 
 well seems to think im pretty good about using edit summaries but i will try to do better in the future d 
 thanks for your understanding just ignore this edit im a reasonably experienced wikipedia editor but a newbie on vandalproof and sometimes my tests with the software go in the wrong places 
 no its quite finei have become used to it d id much rather that my talk page get experimented upon than say jimbos or tawkerbotN s so its really no problem at all plus we can all use a friendly reminder from time to time to use more descriptive edit summaries 
 i hope my comments didnt sound condescending or rude you do have a right to challenge the current criteria and please feel free to do so on the itn talk page i actually think one of the things that made the death criteria more relaxed than before is forceful inclusions of certain us items such as ted kennedys death which was added against the general consensus of itn regulars then people think if kennedy made it then why not this why not that you see my point again please dont be offended at my replies 
 im certainly not offended i just got incensed by this particular item now i shall contemplate whether or not to instigate a principle discussion on the death criterion __ 
 or 
 i have responded on the users talk page __ 
 gah you got any recommendations on this one i have been tracing this since its afd which confused me due to another company (now at 
 this whole situation is an absolute mess im trying to sort out everything thats going on with itthis article 
 i feel quite guilty for getting that afd stopped i worry whats spreading like 
 i can 
 look at the top right of the page __ 
 hey hows it going anyway theres this one user that i ran into 
 the rules on this are so ambiguous at this point the only thing that can be agreed upon is that it is disruptive and should not be prohibited i posted a warning and will keep an eye on him a short block for disruption may be in order 
 sorry but i have already nominated it 
 excellent thats the important thing __ 
 you can nominate 
 i wont do that i have made some edits to this article though to hopefully improve it __ 
 good since i have changed my mind 
 glad i could be of help feel free to inquire here about anything wikirelated __ 
 you mean 
 hi and happy new year i noticed your mass revert for the contributions of N to 
 hello thank you for the good wishes the same to you my rationale is on bad spelling broken links blanking not a good mixture make reverting if that is not enough sorry i cannot add any more points to this rationale however if you feel that this is a good edit please feel free to restore it i am as far removed from dacian issues as can be imagined so really i do not care or mind thank you 
 kan ikke finde der hvor man uoplader billeder 
 images should be uploaded to commonswikimediaorg __ 
 hi thanks for the bug report answered on my talk 
 the problem is that its a shared proxy through which everyone in singapore connects to the internet odds are that its been completely different people each timethis is a situation similar to that of aol not much i or anyone can do about it unfortunately at least until some action is taken by the devs to begin requiring all shared ip anons to connect through the https serverthat may well be a while though 
 for a userbox you can add to your userbox page see 
 why __ 
 hi re i mostly added the category because of their staying in congo before getting arrested what do you say to that 
 i dont believe their status could be considered expatriate lets discuss this on the article talk page if you want to revert me __ 
 maybe a simple question but i dont how to create my user page ( other members have good user pages thanks 
 start simple and add items as you learn how to do it by peaking into the code of other users pages __ 
 thank you 
 thank you very much for formatting the refs i really didnt have time 
 my pleasure __ 
 woops my badi thought i had already blanked that thanks for taking care of it for me let me go check to see if there was anything else regarding this that i need to deal with 
 im sorry whats the username of the indefinitely banned user you believe this to be a sockpuppet of 
 oh i got it sorted out now give me just a second 
 thanks regards 
 you dont provide acceptable sources simply writing i wrote this mostly from the books of bilge umar at the start of a long list of names and their claimed actual etymologies does not cut it at all i doubt for one that umar would be accepted as a source since he has done his studies on these matters in his sparetime apart from his academic career however should you really want to make an earnest attempt at having his opinions presented in various articles you would have to start with presenting coherent logical arguments and having the best possible references for each part of it that would be likely to be contested you should also familiarize yourself with 
 they are not only bilge umars opinions the greeks used the pregreek place names and adopted the pregreek gods 
 the fact that other articles lack reliable sources does not free you of this requirement also you need to cite exactly what bilge and others write not simply present a list of names also your writing is pretty jumbled it would be a great advantage to your chance of getting other editors attention if you could write a lot more structured than you do perhaps ask someone to proofread your discussion posts before you post them __ 
 if i find some time i will rewrite them regards 
 i just installed vandalproof and ran the N exe however despite entering my correct username in vp and logging into wikipedia through the vp browser i couldnt get on being as you added me to the list i hope that you can help thanks 
 a couple of things N are you using the monobook skin N check your cookie setttings in ie be sure that they are enabled and that nothings set strangely N be sure to click remember me when you log in let me know if you get it 
 hi daniel and thanks for your timely response i was able to log on after following your advice while ie cookie protection was only medium i selected the minimum i believe that the problem may have been that i wasnt remembered in login though perhaps that should be noted on the instructions page thanks for your help 
 no problem if theres anything else i can do for you please let me know 
 i was wandering is the prime minister directly elected or is he like our president elected by an electoral group 
 yes the prime minister like the presidant leads a party in the case of the current prime minister the labour party and the population votes for which party they want and the leader of that party and so anon christian that is democracy 
 hello manway i am just letting you know that i deleted 
 hey gfoley thanks for the note for my education what was it deleted under the guy is a linkspammer he is contesting deletion saying he has to get the truth out there i have aivd him which criteria was used so i know what do do next time thanks and kind regards 
 it was deleted under 
 the saying goes back to the N s at least in the circles of aa so i dont think that N book is the source if you want it in there please discuss it in the talk page and change it back to the psy today bcause the current source isnt acceptable in my opinion 
 also the usual procedure for debating a removal it to bring a discussion up on the article talk page not the editor who removed it see 
 the reason i took it up with you on you user talk page was that there was no correspondence between the edit and the edit summary __ 
 ah herrlich ein wikipedianer mit deutschkenntnissen ich wollte dich nochmals bitten einen blick in den baburartikel zu werfen und den oben angesprochen fehler zu korrigieren momentan sieht der artikel aufgrund des fehlers eher schxeN big aus danke schonmal im vorraus 
 so unless you can provide a reliable source for these items the paragraph will either need some serious revision or be eliminated altogether thanks 
 although i share your concerns with regards to this article these are points that need to be addressed on the articles talk page __ 
 good deal i will copy and paste it over there 
 hi meco i realized that you have some interest in gulens biography i would like to take the recent to your attention an author is consistently blanking the page deleting verified information alienating naive editors and blocking others from editing he does not contribute to the article with even a meaningful sentence if you could review with wider support more information and references and compare it with the existing one you will see the difference in depth of covering the issue i believe that supporting could help in having a more neutral biography with more informative context 
 i think maybe entering into gulen conflict territory is a little beyond my stamina right now __ 
 not much of a conflict just a single sockpuppeteer going against community consensus although it is a sockpuppeteer with a lot of stamine (
 nah i was just joking around you can have it i will do with a star is burns btw it looks like we could have this season done by the end of the year what season do we do next season N has the most gas but i dislike a lot of those episodes and scully really sucks on commentary there are N season N gas N from season N and N a piece from seasons N and N my vote is for season N its one of my favourite seasons and it is more recent than others i would be okay with any of the others though 
 yeah flanders did kind of fall off the map during the oakley or weinstein era one of the few bad things about it we could do season N lots of flanders in that one plus it has a fa 
 i definitely think we shouldnt do season N i cant bare to listen to mike the fans are all wrong and this episode is great my god im the best showrunner ever look how many characters i named after my daughters scully ever again i dont mind whether we do season N or N as i love them both and mirkin and bill or josh are great if i had to pick id go for seven 
 you should be happy with season N then gran he doesnt even mention his daughters and he actually acknowledges that kill the alligator and run and saddlesore gallactica are a tad crazy and arent beloved by fans 
 sorry you had to revert my edit to the abu musab alzarqawi page no idea what happened there i can only assume i had a cached version of the page cuz what i was trying to revert was all the british empire nonsense anyway just to let you know i wasnt trying to vandalise cheers 
 no problem at all i figured it was something along those lines and reverting wasnt particualrly difficult 
 if i see a pattern of biased wikiediting with a certain user afds for gay porn stars but also doing so to other gayrelated articles i know theres a procedure to address the behavior of such usersdoesnt it start with an rfc how would somebody go about investigating or beginning that process please reply on thanks

 well shoot i was going to humbly share my barnstar with you but banes went and beat me to it heres a 
 hello i am contacting you because you are listed as a participant for 
 the sources that are given are listed without reference to chapter or page so even though the publications should be easily obtained at a library near where i am i dont think i will even make an attempt without more complete references __ 
 making up a sentence putting it in quotes and attributing it to me is the lowest of the low if you cant argue without lying to try and make your point you shouldnt argue at all it shows low character 
 have you heard about 
 ah so you paraphrase in quotation marks how do you do direct quotations then maybe with commas and ampersands live and learn 
 see also 
 is this an odd example of 
 sort of except my intention is not to vindicate myself however to bring an added perspective to the issue after i read the mentioned article and immediately thought about this thread and that is funny because you also bring another link to my attention that comes as somewhat of an epiphany to me and which i am most happy to learn about __ 
 come back ( 
 i do 
 all i see is an arrogant ip pretending to be banes log in and prove who you are until then banes has not returned

 i read the article talk page discussion and i understand your rationale __ 
 hi there meco i noticed your username on 
 the norwegian article does a reference to cite his death or disappearance __ 
 ah i see it sorry about that i should have looked into it more before requesting translation the thing is has been found to be plagiarized and not citing any reliable sources itself i spoke to another norwegian translator as well and they thought it would be best to see the outcome of the english wikipedia anyway thanks for your consideration either way and sorry for being a bother 
 i see you just speedied this please remember that hoaxes are not included in csd gN id put it through afd and get a quick concensus from comic fans that its a hoax at least it was unverifiable 
 i agree sorry huge backlog and i sometimes dont spend as much time on each as i should restoring now 
 http or or frwikipediaorg or wiki or anatole_bailly 
 why is that important and why should i involve myself in the translation of a french text as you can see on my user page my french is elementary at best __ 
 hi meco as an ip i cant edit a protected article but per and the concurring opinions i would appreciate it if you added that information to the article o 
 thanks 
 no problem __ 
 yes im a novice editor i do not however appreciate the insinuation that my comment was anything but what it was at face value do you areally think someones going to make a sock puppet two years in advance for something that small please as it happens i found the page through 
 actually i never have heard of 
 i have reverted your edit to 
 i have reverted and taken the issue too the talk page 
 as the issue needs wider discussion i have raised the issue at 
 no problem and i agree entirely unfortunately im afraid blocking will always be necessary on wikipedia and we will likely never find a way to prevent the collateral damage from blocking that you had the pleasure of experiencing today anyway feel free to contact me if you ever need my help with anything again 
 never thought you were ignoring me for a second thank you for your comments am a wee bit disappointed my edit summary usage wasnt N per cent tho but i am a little confused what you have new messages thing 
 it was in my 
 hi you might like to have a closer look at the edits being done by N this user has been blocked several times already by several admins but is still carrying on with a campaign of vandalizing edits the earlier blcok have had little effect do you think its time for a longer ban now michaelmaggs N N june N 
 unfortunately the ip address is a shared ip registered to telewest broadband and its quite likely that there are multiple users connect through the ip thus there are twenty or so vandals causing all this mess but possibly hundreds of legitimate editors whom we dont want to disable from editing in any case the person i blocked tonight quite likely is not the same person who got blocked the last time 
 there are several mainstream sources supporting the view that chronic constipation caused elvis presleys death including peter guralnicks famous elvis biography and a recent book by elvisuN s personal physician however one or two wikipedians are trying to suppress this information frequently removing my contribution from the article and falsely claiming that there is no consensus supporting the proposed addition to the featured article see see also 
 i dont have an opinion on the issue and i havent read the article i merely came across the news story which has been circulating the last several days if there are a small number of editors who are blocking appropriate changes to the article maybe one of wikipedias several conflictresolution schemes could be engaged for instance 
 since your previous block against me was related to the article 
 i assume you mean 
 how can i be brief when trying to present facts countering a series of untrue accusations and how can you ignore the weight of it> i have laid out the evidence point for point how can you say it does not disproove the ant of the afd charges jason palpatine N N june N 
 i read throgh the afd i read through the original text of the article and i read through some of your arguments on the drv none of which adequately addressed my concerns nor demonstrated in my mind that the afd had not run its propper course im sorry about this but i really dont think the article has a place on wikipedia if you would like however i would gladly 
 hey dday this is just a courtesy message letting you know that all N judges have selected a finalist and you may now email your scores to this weeks overseer for convenience sake 
 and a very happy birthday to you 
 thank you for your third opinion on the elvis talk page there is now an attempt to ban me from wikipedia may i ask you to have a look at 
 many thanks for your recent commentaries it is a sad thing that a small group of wikipedians seems to dominate the elvis article removing every edit that is not in line with their personal opinion for similar biased attitudes of the same users see also this thread on 
 unfortunately the situation on this article is not unique i have seen it before and it appears very difficult to achieve a breakthrough with such crowds wikipedia has a number of upright administrators and some regular editors who have the clearsightedness and stamina needed to get into an issue like this however they are far between and one is lucky if several such editors converge on an infested nest such as the elvis talk page appears to harbor that could cleanse the air so to speak its a minor consolation that everything is stored for posterity so that the schemers at some point in time will be exposed __ 
 from your various comments on this matter i suspect you have had little or no experience dealing with longterm singleminded editors who latch onto one very specific thing and push and push for years trying to get their way with it a much more notorious case was the nowbanned who for four or five years kept trying to add a single inappropriate sentence to an article N is not on that level but he seems to be doing his best to be working toward it thats why he needs to find something else to edit for awhile and keep himself from getting sent to the phantom zone the choice is really his at this point uN 
 just a question 
 its a minor consolation that everything is stored for posterity so that the schemers at some point in time will be exposed well that certainly works both ways your reluctance or inability to see fault or evidence of any kind of unseemly agenda in N s editing history is really quite astonishing regarding the above question apart from N N meco and colonel warden are not regular editors so why does N try to say otherwise in his version of this question at 
 fyi there is a online database available through the toronto public library website called pages of the past it is free as long as you have a library card if you live outside toronto you should check your local library to see if they provide access i was able to view the 
 thankyou i have access to a fair number of online resources with my library card but possibly not that i will have a look and see 
 im not able to connect the dots __ 
 i just thought these diffs show that these users are cooperating on the administrators noticeboard in the meantime i have asked administrator fred bauder who was the former arbcom member who wrote my probation order if he thinks that i have violated this probation here is his response this may be a further argument for starting a new discussion on 
 firstly from a good faith perspective i dont see it problematic that these editors are talking in private i didnt react to any of their dialog as being scheming or conspiratorial as for threads being archived on wpani that is being done automatically by a bot when there has been no posts in a thread for two or three days i hope to read the discussion you had with fred bauder a little later __ 
 if it were in private yall couldnt see it doncha know everything in articles and talk pages generally speaking is visible to everyone meanwhile an editor on the elvis talk page is unable to find anything in the exdoctors book that supports N s claim of what the exdoctor supposedly said something does not compute uN 
 please be aware that you are in violation of wikipedia policies and it is politely requested that you remove the protection before a formal complaint is filed i am writing a thorough article on the topic in question but found that every time i hit update it had been deleted please undelete the article at once thank you 
 if you disagree with the articles deletion then please seek a 
 i have unblocked 
 yeah thats fine with me though i am going to keep a close eye on him 
 im not taking a side on this article either way i simply stepped in and protected when the edit war got out of hand please discuss it on the articles talk page or seek 
 though i agree with your point your revert and reinsert a link which actually should not be there at all please consider that the burden of proving the necessity of inclusion is on the inserter and that the original insertion was unjustifiable 
 sure my issue with the bot was exclusively on technical grounds i dont have flash on this terminal so i have been unable to review the video myself yet __ 
 thanks for your support sadly 
 hey congrats you better not let me down on 
 hmm which is exactly one of the reasons why youtube links are to be avoided in the first place especially as external links i have done a second attempt to cover the problem of the templates though it is controversial there watching the bots output logs now to see if it works 
 looks like copyvio also 
 thanks for your thoughtfulness and civility in notifying me 
 im not an admin __ 
 appreciate your advising me wishing you well 
 as you requested i have you crat rights on the test wiki 
 woohoo thanks now im a sysop on N wikis N test wikis and one actual wiki 
 if you feel that doing so would be appropriate could you contribute to the 
 i would gladly participate in the dispute and any user conduct rfc you decided to file i remember there being a few other users who got involved too whom i can find by glancing through my archives keep me in touch and i will go take a look at easypizzas talk page 
 thats exactly what im addressingwith humor rather than willful blindness the underlying conflict on the talk page of the featured article 
 if you do become so inclined meco you might want to actually read archived material relating to certain persistent editors like here for example and 
 dockino there are alternatives besides willful blindness and pungent humor humor is inappropriate in a conflict as bitter as the one in question it becomes a guise for throwing punches camouflaged by asserting i was just making a lighthearted comment i have no wish to put pressure on you to make less of an effort to have the article presented in the manner you feel is the most appropriate all i demand is that you do so openly and squarely applying rhetorical ploys is unacceptable __ 
 a fresh pair of eyes in any article can indeed be enlightening but historical perspective is vital as is responding squarely to cogent arguments otherwise i fear you will critically undermine your credibility and i am not demanding you do these things i am asking you 
 as for your repeated question of whether i still agree that claims made by N three years ago regarding presleys bi or homosexuality deserve mentioning in the article i have a hard time owning up to that position could you provide med with a diff for my original statement __ 
 see your post at N N may N 
 right i havent updated myself on this since writing that comment __ 
 im baaack thanks for the comments i was wondering if you would be able to take a stance since you are now happy with everything in the article rbN and nbsp( 
 all righty 
 you may be interested in voicing your opinion at as it also concerns and other norwegian categories 
 i have attempted to answer your question on that nomination please let me know if you have any further questions 
 very nice thats what i was looking for __ 
 hello amidaniel i spoke to nathan and he said that he sent you an email that you might not have recieved i got the impression that he was willing to repair relations 
 yes i received the email recently but have not yet had time to respond to him i too would like to repair any harm that may have been caused by meim just a little busy at the moment i will however respond soon 
 okay i relayed that information to nathan 
 why did you didnt like it cant see that the new one is any vast improvement in quality my poor bracelet feels slighted hehe 
 i find the colors much more vivid and fresh in the new photograph do you disagree __ 
 hey there i was just performing my regular stalking rounds before leaving and i noticed the moderator issue stuff i was wondering am i still a mod or was that revoked cheers 
 you are currently a moderator 
 you should still be i know that mboverload had some difficulties a while ago so i wonder if something may be a bit screwy if you are unable to access the moderator tools then i apologize and no i have not revoked your status 
 yes and no uN i have userfied the page but not at your sandbox since we have to preserve editing history it wouldnt work to copy or paste it over therefore i have moved it to 
 thats even better i will move it into main namespace again if i can manage to find sources for it __ 
 go ahead if you like just leave a copy of the current template somewhere in my userspace thanks i dont like it stretched out over the page 
 kk sorry one of my pet peeves d 
 endorse deletion 
 thanks again for your thoughtfulness 
 somebodys proposed the new article for deletion too i challenged him on his talkpage to identify if he ever read it at all to begin with and if so why he thinks its not notable enough as i told him we can write articles on stupid 
 you need to develop some stamina if you are going to do this i noticed you had blanked the article after removing the prod that was rash and illadvised in my opinion __ 
 i assume you already know this but vandalproof does not list all denied users if you deny more then one see 
 yep i know i had a redim statement instead of a redim preserve thus the previous values were getting erased everytime i added one now fixed on mine you will just have to wait p 
 i noticed you an admin mode as well will that be out in the next version 
 yes it most certainly will d i have actually had blocking working on testwikipedia for quite some time and today i decided to try it out on en seemed to work flawlesslyonly bug was that i forgot i was on the same ip as my test account and was completely baffled when it failed to post my block message once because i was blocked p i have made a couple notes about what im working on in vN at 
 nice the other thing that is bugging me is that there is no way to automatically send a message is there any chance of that being added 
 yeah i could probably implement something along those linesnot really all that difficult actually oh and just so you know since im going interwiki with this next release im now reworking the whole approval process 
 how about 
 well yes i agree i dunno i think id still like to host the lists and technical requirements in my userspace just for consistency between projects but i think it probably is about time to move 
 i think ultimately it is up to you i cant see any reason for it not be there especially if it would be interwiki on an unrelated note would it be possible for someone who is a sysop but not you to edit 
 currently yes any sysop can edit it and have their changes actualizedit would be quite easy for me to change this in fact absolutely painless however i think im going to leave it that way especially when vp goes live on other projects i likely wont be around all the time and it may be necessary for a sysop to step in and change the mods list also if for some unforseeable reason im no longer able edit wikipedia or continue the project further i think it would be quite beneficial if any sysop would be able to adjust mod lists in my absence should that ever be necessary if we are willing to trust sysops with the block button i think i should be able to trust them with deciding who can or cannot modify vps user list 
 sounds good by the way 
 please dont add patrolling soldiers dancing incident to the article im reverting this because it has nothing to do with the song the video itself is whats is causing controversy no critic has called the song controversial the song was used in the video without keshas permission so dont add it thanks 
 please see my reply 
 this is an automated notice by 
 fixed 
 excellent points at the deletion discussion i have trouble distinguishing between the two other editors they almost seem like the same editor to me how would you suggest we address this the points made to them are rationale factbased and policybased they just in unison raise irrelevant points this feels much like a filibuster thoughts 
 it does look like a filibuster i didnt care to endure the silliness because i felt that if the two lil editors wanted to 
 i appreciate your reconsidering your view at the afd not because it gravitated towards mine but because i always respect those who have the thoughtfulness and lack of ego to reconsider positions already taken its a wonderful trait just thought i would mention it cheers 
 btwdo you realize that those conducting the filibuster are N years old and N years old this does militate in favor of an age limit 
 i didnt know that but its wonderful that young people get involved in wikipedia they will learn so much in the process and its our responsibility not to let them run the show on their immature premises we will just have to treat them with some patience and respect __ 
 hahaha well lets see if thats still your view the next time your run into a fifth grade class where the teacher has encouraged them all to open up wikipedia accounts and they descend like locusts on one of the articles that interest you with a N fifthgraders consensus view that is shall we say suspect 
 well we can deal with that too should it come to that we might have to develop some new procedural tools though as for the current situation we do not need to wait for the two teenagers to accede the consensus position if the consensus is clear and they refuse to budge ie keep reverting the article then there can be issued an edit restriction on them which will cause them to be banned if they violate it lets hope it doesnt come to that __ 
 agree btw have you opined as of yet at your own rfc 
 perhaps i forgot i will look into it __ 
 speaking of vandalproof can i have the admin version now i just want to test it out also because the wiki is no longer hosted on wheres computer and it is hosted on a real server do you want to do your testing there instead of bugging the devs the new location is http or or wikixyraelnet or mediawiki or indexphp or main_page thanks 
 you are going to have to wait like everyone else and its also not just like i push a couple of buttons and voila it works on every wiki you are going to have to give me some time and your request is relatively low priority no offense also the admin tools arent really that amazing currently only blocking and warning a user in one click as for using wheres wiki im afraid much rather do my bot testing on the dev wiki since it runs off the nfs copy it is almost identical to en whereas wheres is quite different though none the less fun to play on 
 please go to the 
 hey leftorium if you have got time could you help me beef up the production section for a few simpsons articles im working on specifically 
 okay thanks do you think there will be enough information to bring it to featured article status or is the production information on the episode sorely lacking 
 hm its really difficult finding an episode that has enough material for an fa 
 i might be able to get my hands on commentary for greyhounds and violence so im looking for notes on mother now 
 oh alright season N it is then 
 sure just do whichever episode of the three you want 
 awesome thanks 
 feel free to use that image if you think its best i have little experience working on television episode articles so im not so sure which scene to depict in screenshots 
 okay thanks done using templates 
 good idea done i have nominated the article 
 an aside on this the two teenagers you are referring to are actually pretty decent editors i wind up alternately arguing with them and agreeing with them on different occasions but find that they both argue positions from a policy basis not perfectly but not many editors do argue perfectly its substantially different from the group of fifty thirdgraders you refer to i think you should view their positions the same way you do those of any editor you disagree with and not factor the age very heavily and mdash 
 i think that is wise also they obviously take offense to any attempt to make an issue of their age and it really isnt necessary in this case where the arguments fail the argument can still be the focus of discussion __ 
 agreed i dont believe that age was a starting point of analysis of their views it was just something noticed after having run into their views or approach i look forward to the having the alternate experience you refer to 
 to be clear i actually stated i have no intention of backing down im just very strong minded but i do admit if im in the wrong with that said i could have overreacted to you calling or noting my age as its sometimes hard to determine someones tone over a computer i hold no ill will towards either of you and i look forward to interacting with you two in the future happy editing 
 as i indicated to meco above i respected him for reconsidering his position as to your statement of course you had no intention of backing down if you had such an intention obviously you would have already done it what that sentence suggests is that no matter what the future conversation your intention is to not let it change your mind thats not what i at least view as a mature approach in fact it is the opposite of what i had lauded meco for i do not equate a steadfast consistency in the face of whatever further discussion may reveal as strongminded but rather as something lesser and i view that attitude as one not conducive to further conversation i look forward to working with you as well 
 steadfastness when it comes to principles but malleability when it comes to responding to new facts that should be the virtuous behaviour to strive for the problem usually arises when what one believes to be higher principles arent as thoroughly thought through as one believed them to be then one has to revise ones principles also and that will cause the person to appear inconsistent that of course is much preferrable to the alternative which is to stick to ones position despite having come to realize it is wrong __ 
 well said problems also arise imho when one commits to being steadfast despite whatever new facts or considerations might be unveiled in the future an example of one of the above as well as again not quite viewing wp rules the way some of the rest of us do 
 thats just being 
 from what i searched on google c++ or cli is out plain and simple the current version of the net framwork is yet working on mac os right now forget my offer to help i am sorry amidaniel i jumped too soon when i saw you express confidence in c# i assumed that c++ or cli would work as well 
 hey eagle glad to see you are backkinda disappeared for a while anyway thanks for your offer i was under the impression that c was quite a multiplatform languagewhat on earth do those apple people program in anyway im going to look into this realbasic thing and see how difficult a translation would be i really wish i had begun this entire project in c but it was one of these things that began as righting a simple little rc patrol script and then grew and grew and grew until it was too late to begin it in c i dunno we will see i think im going to focus my energy currently on getting N out and getting it operational on other wikis right now the mac experience will have to wait 
 re 
 ah yes i couldnt think of it just then i dunno what do you think of the changes to the message i find it a bit too intimidating but i dunno just sort of stumbled upon it and felt like cleaning up a bit also what wiki are you an admin on 
 thanks judging from the responce from drv i should have just come straight to you but after having done some resarch im not sure that i even want it would it not be better to just write it up from scratch and lessen the chance of a speedy deletion under gN if i recreate it thanks again for being willing to help out 
 well i would recommend that if youd like to attempt recreating the article you begin it somewhere in your userspace and once you feel it has matured into a full and unique article id recommend you return to drv and present your new version in your userspace and see if the community supports moving your version into mainspace if you recreate it at its original location no matter how unique it is i cant guarantee that it wouldnt be deleted under gN anyway i will gladly userfy it for you and please feel free to ask if you have any questions about wikipedias deletion processes or anything else 
 i know i have been acting like a 
 ok done and not to worry wps deletion processes can be quite perplexing i have been busy on fds for months now and still dont understand all of the minor intricacies 
 hello i noticed you are a member of wikiproject alternative medicine which i am in the process of joining is it a friendly group i also noticed your interest in reich and wondered if you have a contact address outside of wikipedia i am currently half way through reading the mass psychology of fascism but i have no one local to me who shares the same interest 
 you can find my facebook contact info on my user page as for wikiproject alternative medicine being friendly id say its not really that active there are some skeptics there but i think the majority are positive towards alternative medicine __ 
 i respect your opinion at the afd for the idf tick tock incident however i do not appreciate your comments about myself and other editors acting as a filibuster i robustly deny suggestion by yourself that there is an form of collusion involved in the afd or any of the other discussions relating to myself furthermore it was rude and disrespectful of you to bring in both mine and llclklls age into account our pov is no more or no less valid than yours and to somehow suggest that we are acting immaturely is not on in case you dont know what im talking about im referring to a conversation between you and 
 first you seem to confuse me with another editor i have not used the term filibuster nor have i brought your age and that of the other lil editor into account that said i have responded to this emphasis by another editor by volunteering my personal opinion that both of you display some hallmarks of adolescence immaturity by course of nature being one of them i dont believe i have stated anything that warrants the label disrespectful let alone uncivil in the current dispute __ 
 well for one speaking of others in a patronising and mocking tone is disrespectful wiki is a collaborative effort and so differences in opinion will exist i have accepted that my pov is going to be overruled with the afd and offered some form of suggestion on how to move forward however once again you have patronised me and ignored what i actually said 
 im surprised to see this notice from liluniqueN here as it seems so out of place meco i found your discussion at both 
 that last quote is me if you see the 
 yes i failed to check your premises for your premises and mdash and nbsp 
 meco you may find the age or maturity issues discussed in this N yearolds justwithdrawn to be of some mild interest 
 ten years ago i resigned as the chief administrator of an irc channel with N simultaneous active users during prime time and a host of channel operators that i was in charge of im all too familiar with the shortcomings in this arena of this age group and their real motivations for seeking online status and responsibility that is an eternal dilemma the people least qualified are the most eager and those most qualified are conversely the most reluctant or downright unwilling __ 
 sounds like a commentary that could apply as well to those who seek political office 
 hi i was the original editor who had a problem with the anon that keeps changing this article and i noticed today that he had again replaced the unsourced and unreliable version a full two years since the problem began well done for trying to change it but my previous efforts to stop him were all unsuccessful and eventually i gave up if you have any suggestions on how to deal with the issue id be happy to assist 
 thankyou for negotiating the sometimes bewildering beauraucracy that it takes to get these things to happen it was that more than the reverts that caused me to give up originally what i cant understand is why this single purpose user is so determined to a continue to insert this version of events over such an extended period b so determined to have exactly this version in the article without compromise and c how they know so quickly that their changes have been removed anyway its sorted for now and your efforts are much appreciated you need help with anything please let me know 
 woohoo thanks for the congrats i honestly never thought this project would reach a quarter of the size it has it just keeps growing and growing and growing hopefully even larger once i get the interwiki projects thrown together 
 im sorry that you didnt get a chance to contribute to the afd discussion however if you would like to reopen the debate again you may gladly seek a 
 thanks for listing that 
 yay go the cabals then 
 can i have your permission to make a vp setup file 
 no need to ask permission if you have the time it would be much appreciated as my only winN k machine is currently down 
 thanks for the revert on my userpage 
 anytime im sure youd do the same for me d 
 i think i have its just your userpage gets vandalized so many times i cant find a diff this was only the second time my page was vandalized and the first time was by my brother so that one doesnt really count so basically my userpage only got vandalized once i guess vandals dont like me 
 i was assessing 
 i dont remember any of these two i suggest you look at a version of the article from when i added them to the wikiproject probably they contained some information then that has since been removed __ 
 apparantly for a few month these pages were in the 
 seevote N N june N seevotedanseevote N N june N 
 im sorry but wikipedia cannot accept copyrighted material and all contributions must further conform to the 
 from how i read your website it seems like a reasonably accurate summary perhaps your website is not as clear to others as you think by my understanding of copyright issues everything is copyrighted unless the copyright holder specifically releases it into the public domain or applies another licence to it such as the 
 you cant add a tag without giving a reason on the talk page of the article either selfrevert or provide a reason please 
 as you can read yourself in the template instructions this tag is to attract attention to the fact that there is an ongoing content dispute in order to bring in outside opinions it is quite clear that this banner is most appropriate without the need for discussing its adding on the talk page __ 
 there is a very minor disagreement over a couple of words and i am sorry but you are required to justify a tag addition on the talk page otherwise its fly by tagging which is discouraged 
 i indented my reply like that because it was not part of the normal flow of conversation it was a specific minor response to a point snowded made that would not and did not warrant any reply placing it within the normal flow of the thread would result it in getting further and further away from the point snowded made it was important to keep snowdeds comment and my comment together because it involved an important issue that was not otherwise related to the rest of the conversation 
 very well you are arguing that you indented in this fashion due to exceptional circumstances then i shall concede your right to make use of exceptional ways of working this out i suggest you proceed with idiosyncratic indentation practices with extreme discernment and caution i say this also because if more people start ad libing their indentation practices we are sure to have the second confusion of babel descend on us shortly hyperbolically speaking __ 
 does that make sense 
 it does and it would be great if this could be injected into the existing examples and howtos at wpindent __ 
 dogruN i dont know why you felt you had to restore the material about mike wofford playing a tack piano on daktari to the shelly manne page its an interesting fact but to me it clearly belongs on a page about daktari or mike wofford the first time i didnt just remove that and related details from the shelly manne page i moved them to the daktari page even adding some more details there if anyone is interested they can just click the links the shelly manne article is supposed to be about him not about unusual instruments other musicians might have played on his albums 
 ok i see your point but i think that the way you added the tackpiano thing was too abrupt a change from what the rest of the paragraph was talking about i have come up with another version that i think more smoothly integrates this point into what i was trying to say about manne and his openness to experimentation hopefully we are both satisfied now 
 i have restored the histories of the userboxes however i would think it better to move them rather that cnpmove do you mind if i migrate these to your userspace for you 
 that would be delightful uN 
 alright i will do that in just a bit 
 is there any way to see articles in the articles as to encarta could start doing one 
 i am sorry i just couldnt understand what you wrote __ 
 okis there any way to create articles as of encarta 
 i have never looked at encarta so i couldnt tell __ 
 ok thanks 
 i thank you for posting discussion notices for the uboat naming discussions but you might be more careful with the wording in the future to avoid accusations of 
 fair point sorry 
 why what was wrong i added the facets that made it important first in x years to calm tensions 
 i have explained it 
 now they are going around inserting ts into articles should the range be blocked again and mdash 
 unfortunately seems to be the only solution at the moment 
 heh thanks aol ips shouldnt be listed on aiv should they and mdash 
 erm probably not something like this should more likely be reported in irc channels or on 
 thanks it was just that one time my report got removed because it was an aol ip btw one final question if you dont mind me asking should {{
 well you may want to ask someone else on that one i personally find the bv template is used far too liberally given the bluntness of the warningi personally regard it as a template synonymous to or thus it should really only be used following tN tN etc but thats just my opinion others think its usage is justified after the first ill edit 
 i see what you are saying i need to get some sleep now btw indian isnt a single language p and mdash 
 erm i was just about to correct that d good nite sleep tight and dont let the bed bugs bite im always available if you need me for anything 
 alright and mdash 
 i hope you dont mind too much that i deprodded the previous deletion discussion was almost a year ago 
 sure however with the article having no 
 uN 
 question answered on your talk page __ 
 pastor terry jones arrested for child pornography 
 i find it hard to wrap my head around this story firstly the first url is unavailable to me so im unable to evaluate it the second is a strange news item that im unsure what it exactly is i find it very odd that an nbc news story should list www
 figured the vandalism specialist would be a good one to contact here 
 i assume you are talking about 
 interesting initative i have registered and made several posts __ 
 i need you to reset the mods again type N mismatch 
 note that tbc has been renamed to tree biting conspiracy and stollery to gien 
 you may be interested in 
 i appreciate the headsup i dont know how i can immediately help to expand the list but i will certainly put it on my watchlist and keep an eye open for possible additions __ 
 should be good now sorry for the delay 
 thanks 
 im not 
 thats ok __ 
 hopefully within the next couple of weeks though i may put out a quick patch for some of these minor bugs sometime rather soon 
 it is inappropriate for you to remove speedy deletion templates from pages you have created yourself as you did and the template quite clearly states do not remove this notice from pages that you have created yourself if you you disagree with the pages proposed speedy deletion please add directly below the tag and add your reasoning on the talk page 
 perhaps you are right but mere common sense should suffice to see the inappropriateness of the template for speedy deletion based on the category being empty when the category isnt empty __ 
 the category only has content because you keep adding a single article to it while other editors have been removing the category if it wasnt for your editwarring over this there would be no content regardless theres no perhaps about it the template is quite clear 
 the category currently has three articles and it would be very easy to add a whole not more uncontroversially i might add by simply continuing to populate this category hierarchy which you appear 
 i believe vandalproof is written in 
 wishing you and your loved ones a happy thanksgiving day 
 i wish you the same happy thanksgiving my best to you and yours 
 as a completely separate issue you might like to consider to start archiving your talk page at N kb its getting a bit large and is awkward to load 
 i am aware of the issue and i have been encouraged before also to do as you suggest __ 
 some of the parts were content disputeish but the anon kept removing the main image w or o any explanation its that vandalism and mdash 
 i think thats disputable but it seems like a content dispute to me that is the anon is not trying deliberately to deface the article in any case if its decided that these edits are vandalism id still say that its not frequent enough to warrant protection i will keep an eye on the article for you though and step in if it does get out of hand 
 alright thanks i see what you are saying adios and mdash 
 i love how understanding you are d it makes it so much easier to work together thank you 
 what you think i was going to yell at you p you are welcome and mdash 
 well look at the majority of posts on my talk page and you will see why its quite shocking everytime someone addresses me in a friendly and professional tone p im more used to you asshole im going to sue you and get you desysopped for this horrible abuse of your admin powers s 
 haha i see you protect a lot of pages to the wrong version same on you then again theres also the delightful privilege of getting your userpage vandalized N times a day i actually sort of like it and mdashthey are almost like barnstars in a way and mdash 
 after going away to read the current definition of excessive linking i find its not readily findable from the manual of style the google search finds only usages which assume the definition i will start more discussion about other detailed points at 
 in summary creating 
 thats actually a good idea i really dont know how it could be remedied in regards to visually impaired readers you should talk to an admin about it because i think its beyond my scope there may also be some information on the talk page of the mos 
 you have already been warned that you dont have consensus for your promosed organizational categories create another one and get blocked for ignoring consensus and editing disruptively in contempt of established policies and procedures 
 i do understand that you want to become an administrator one day but you are not one yet and your style suggests you shouldnt be one either __ 
 are you actually looking at what you are hitting undo on or just going willynilly at it was clearly mistagged your undo reverted back to the mistagged image i realize you want to undo all the changes i have made but there is a possibility that i did something other than just remove unnecessary categories 
 how is it appropriate to remove the fair use rationale which you did __ 
 public domain images do not require a fair use rationale because they are not fair use images following the licensing templates will explain it in more depth 
 ok i see your rationale then i agree on that particular one with you edit __ 
 this is clearly just text and does not meet the threshold of originality a couple letters placed at an angle doesnt change the fact that it is composed of plain text in line with 
 i beg to differ i think it certainly holds up as a work covered by intellectual property laws of course if you insist this is not so we can make a call with the nice people over at 
 there is a difference between trademark and copyright just because its a public domain image doesnt mean that the ip is not protected 
 i was not discussing trademark im discussing whether the logo can be considered to be in the public domain i find that unlikely very unlikely __ 
 unfortunately you have protected a version of the article which now includes only a third of the original text as nearly twothirds of the article have been deleted by 
 please see 
 let me know if my revert of you was a mistake and mdash 
 lol i got scared and mdash 
 d 
 ummm i am on irc s 
 at 
 all the issues have now been dealt with i welcome further comments from you at the 
 please help me categorize the existing historic norwegian images on wikicommons by year so that our readers would be able to access those images when they press on the links to the wikicommons pages at the bottom the years in norway articles 
 i will try and look into that tomorrow __ 
 thanks 
 done 
 when you nominated us ofac specially designated global terrorist it would have been common courtesy to notify the category creator 
 in the case of category nominations notifying the creator of the category is not done as a matter of course as in the case of article nominations it is sometimes done but very often not it certainly would be illadvised to take the lack of notification as a sign of disrespect or lack of common courtesy however realizing the need for better notification routines i have since this nomination made efforts to showcase the category nominations notification templates more prominently so hopefully you and others are less likely to miss categories being nominated for deletion in the future __ 
 how did you block version N by placing donotallow vN _N _N wouldnt that block N second the bug when you use the mod tools to welcome new users the cancel button does not change to done when you are finished if you welcomed more then N user 
 i forgot to change the code in between versions as for the notify contributors function im working on fixing itjust forgot a couple lines of code 
 hi amidaniel i recently proposed the idea of a welcomebot at 
 oh really glad to see im not the only proponent of this idea yes i have been mildly pushing for a welcomebot for quite some time and i would be more than glad to code the bot i would however need to find someone else to host the bot for me as i dont have a a server handy i know that before i received my welcome i had no clue about the project and after i received it well i was an instant addict i agree that there is a central impersonal element but i think a welcomebot would be quite advantageous is there a discussion going on about this somewhere 
 thanks for the format changes 
 no problem and if you want to hide it altogether you can open up your monobookcss and add #sitenotice 
 meco with at 
 no i did not break N rr _ 
 im sorry you are right i mistook moxy for meco in the edit history 
 now that you have removed the original sorting scheme for the category positional numeral systems you need to edit the category page accordingly and create the list of these pages in numerical order that we are now missing eg 
 please see 
 you need to download the patch as i indicated on the welcome page from 
 i think its better with activist just plain isnt it 
 this touches upon 
 there already is an id with the n capitalized 
 yo i already got that thanks though 
 well there is a way to ask a question and not 
 response given at 
 this page is a little long it would also help 
 i have no idea about what your first line is supposed to convey __ 
 the indention request that you asked for just before i replied 
 why do you give a disjointed response to a request on another page in the middle of a section here without even referencing what you are talking about __ 
 just to clarify before asked again i have duly given reason for each tag on the talk page when we discuss these then we start taking them off so the article is in fact improved by the addition of the tags 
 i have also added an el tag but per talk one link can be taken from that section 
 hi i have noticed this article with a typo in the title still pretty new here and dont know how to get this corrected could you help please regards 
 looks like someone else has already dealt with it sorry for my really slow response im a little out of things at the moment d 
 i have followed your link to the appropriate page but it doesnt seems to work again can you help me see what the problem is my page is at http or or mswikipediaorg or wiki or kategorimasjid and mdash 
 ok i have made the changes and it should work now although its not very helfpul at this point since theres only two different letters being used im not sure what template you were using since it was in a foreign language i just replaced it with the text for the cataz template if you would like to know exactly how i did this and how you can create a template in your language to it let me know i will be glad to help 
 its probably best not to delete the article as its history should be preserved for 
 if you believe there to be consensus for your opinions on the article please 
 i agree thats the same conclusion that i have come to 
 yes definitely was the culprit esk and gatton both look ok to me now i havent tried any others 
 hello i think some of the fact tags you have added in the article are unnecessary for example londens own article is a sufficient source for the sentence beginning with these words londen claims that he has seen 
 it would be sufficient if it says that but i havent found it in that article thats why i placed the request tag __ 
 in fact you are right my mistake
 then you should write that also in your edit summary as you backtrack your mistake instead of loudly proclaiming im mistaken and then quietly revert yourself when that shows not to be correct also you removed another citation request concerning the ehrensvxeN rd society did you find a reference to this name in the londen article i didnt __ 
 well yes that would have been polite i apologize and you are right the ehrensvxeN rd society was not actually mentioned in the londen article i asked the user fullfacts to stop adding nonreferenced information in referenced sentences and i must be more careful myself
 its okay most of us above N on the topN are equally addicted as you though none of us made superb vandal fighting programs 
 thought it was cute 
 ohhh its not real ( you had me goingi thought someone was finally going to gas up my car for me d 
 ami please forgive me for editing your page but the formatting of that comment bordered on criminal its content is probably not criminal but it kind of boggles the mind 
 im afraid you may be contacting the wrong person im not even sure i have ever edited the article on 
 im afraid you going to be a little bit more specific before i can help you have you been blocked or did you receive a message on your talk page from me 
 as far as i know the date june N th was introduced by the the annonymous user who wrote the text above had not provided any sources or arguments that the war ended on july N th regards 
 i think unprotection would be a very bad idea at the moment id like to advice you to pursue 
 i went there i wanted to write it but they say edit conflict or i dont have time now i cant read it and i didnt understand it please help me all is about 
 bori the quote is ataturk calling himself a donkey i cant see any swearing can you point me to where someone swears 
 not calling himself do you know turkish 
 ok then hes calling people named kemal donkey since kemal was his name it reads like its some kind of joke about himself in any case its a sourced quote of something ataturk himself said and if he isnt calling himself a donkey nobody else is calling him a donkey either 
 well sure im not finished there are a number of sources to grab material from also as you will see from what i have added so far these are statements blxfccher has provided about himself mostly __ 
 right 
 sure but as long as they are attributed to him thats for anyone with a critical mind to realize and it also satisfies the requirements in wpblp i will check the language to make sure nothing of what are subjective claims come off as neutral __ 
 it seems you are part of the process that has deleted my wiki article this process has obviously been determined by a bunch of people who dont know martial arts it seems like the bulk of the complaints are either disbelievers or pilers on who dont have any substantive complaints i am at this point unsure if i have been deleted because people dont believe all the things on the page or because the people believe the person as described is nonnotable i believe the votes were a case of the former and not the later 
 i assume you are speaking of 
 i am not sure i understand what the user space option is please explain 
 the article has now been 
 can you add a column for groups designated as terrorist organizations by china now 
 its such a big job and i dont know if i will be able to prioritize it __ 
 none of the things mentioned actually exists arent blatantly bogus pages speediable 
 no hoaxes are exclude from speedy deletion see 
 anyway it exists he just cant even spell the name of his own film right its got a grand total of N hits on ifilm 
 per 
 you can discuss this on the articles talk page where i have created a section with reference to this link __ 
 this edit of yours seems to have done a little collateral damage to a sentence and a cite for it that id just put together i will restore it but if your deletion of material was intentional please leave me a note explaining why thanks 
 oops not intentional __ 
 what did i delete or edit apart from my own comments 
 http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitletalkshelling_of_yeonpyeong and diffprev and oldidN __ 
 i never touched that section i have only written on the merge and korean war ended sections but had edit conflict when doing so and so i waited and then redid my comments later on deleting other peoples talk comments isnt my style 
 that is good to hear however you obviously did remove my comment even if it was inadvertently and that was the only thing you did in that edit __ 
 no i did not remove your comment there must be a problem with the software for edit conflict i tried to make my edit to the hasnt the korean war ended section it wasnt accepted due to edit conflict and so i just clicked on the article tab to exit editing the talk section and then went back later to make my comments i dont actually see how any edit conflict should have arisen as we were editing different sections as you can see from the link you sent me above 
 the edit diff clearly proves that you did remove my comment i have never before experienced anyone who actually rejects the evidence of this as this isnt an important incident im afraid we wont see any investigation into your extraordinary assertion that is unless you are going to address the developers of the mediwiki software about this in that case i will appreciate a headsup __ 
 the edit diff shows that i was editing the hasnt the korean war ended section not the copyright image section so how do you explain that then i will ignore your comments regarding me rejecting evidence and making extraordinary assertions 
 does your view of the url to the diff which i provided above look the same as it does to me http or or iN photobucketcom or albums or ssN or halvor_meco or screenshots or wikiscrpng __ 
 look at the top it states i am editing hasnt the korean war ended as i said earlier there must be a problem with the edit conflict software because i never touched your comment 
 ok you were fooled by that section reference dont be when there are edit conflicts and you save the page suddenly you are saving the entire page not just the section you were working on but the prefaced section reference in the edit summary box remains the same i think i have been fooled by this myself in the past also but now i have learned __ 
 as i have said several times already i never touched the copyrighted image section there must be a software error such that either your change didnt save or it was deleted when i tried to make my edit but i didnt do it i have spent enough time defending myself for something i didnt do and so will now get back to writing articles 
 on another note you could have talked to me about the not a forum template but you chose not to and reverted it twice even after i have quoted 
 i didnt look at what wplame would have to suggest i agree its not a big deal nor would i think of it as an edit wat i may be persistent but im not immovable and i think also not belligerent __

 the first link is freepository which has problems downloading from ff or opera you can solve the problem pretty easily either by adding exe to the filename or you can download using internet explorer the second one was being mirrored by 
 not meaning to rub my opinion in but wikipedia is corrupt and should be N per cent christian im sorry but thats the truth 
 alright you keep your opinion unfortunatly it wont change wikipedia as long as that is your opinion and nothing more ie a reason to vandalise this site you will be fine 
 hello mr adams i apologize that you were unable to edit this morning however if you will have a look at your you will see that neither i nor any other administrator has intentionally blocked your account as glen stated above what happened is that you are likely connected through a shared ip address (glen indicated that you were connected through 
 thanks amidaniel the issue is fixed i will do what you suggest if it happens again 
 both filtering and flag are done should be available shortly 
 backlinks and namespaces done 
 yay thank you so much i absolutely love your query api i owe pretty much all the credit for my next release of vandalproof to you let me go try them out and see if everything works right 
 minor problem 
 hey mate as you seem to be the only other person who works with this page frequently as i do id love your thoughts 
 no problem sorry about all the inconvenience last nighttheres a bug with the autoblocker when accounts are indefblocked thats often quite a pain to repair let me know if i can do anything else for you 
 hello this message is being sent to inform you that there currently is a discussion at 
 to the both of you why are you posting nonsense messages on my talk page you are notifying me in duplicate of a discussion which i started and the personal comment from mztourist this isnt a competition im not trying to defeat you so you keeping scores is just demeaning yourself __ 
 i believe this may be because you used spaces rather then underscores when you set him or her as a moderator but that is just a wild guess 
 hmm yes 
 hmm really i had no idea i was an unofficial lead clerk although i did set up the subpage system help is always appreciated especially admin help notably there is a lack of following up blocking confirmed malicious socks other then that we are pretty good 
 note that a lot of help is needed in transferring old rfcus over to the new system although you do not need to be a clerk to do that 
 alright well i will go ahead and add my name to the clerks then and let me know what needs to be done as for converting the old reports to the new formatthat sounds like something a bot would be good at have you thought about requesting one id be glad to code it if i could get approval 
 you are correct about the inappropriate deletion by mztourist i thought you were referring to his own edits but i see it here http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitletalkshelling_of_yeonpyeong and diffnext and oldidN please accept my apology for this error but also lets put this debate to rest 
 as i have made the case in several of my most recent posts at wpani if what mztourist explains having done is dead accurate then there is a software error issue here that is very dire that needs to be properly acknowledged and addressed that is where im currently at in this matter __

 they are in for a surprise they dont have my support 
 hi thanks for the regex for the bad links project however it doesnt appear to catch the http links i copied it straight and put it into awb and it doesnt appear to work see here 
 i wrote the regexs with the intent of having them implemented directly into the awbs code if put in the code the extra escapes the following ones hence it will work embedded in the awbs code but not in the find and replace plus in the code it can be two regexs i will try the link you gave me with the regexs in awbs code and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 oh i see thanks for the quick response 
 i tested the program and it does fix the towanda link i will implement the fix as soon as bluemoose emails me the lastest source code and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 it works and nbsp and mdash and nbsp

 thanks again for notifying me of the drv i will let my statements speak for me but i will follow along thanks for being polite and civil and if you need more help just let me know

 for the record i find that the N critical foreign dependencies initiative list as transmitted in a secret diplomatic cable to the secretary of state and released by wikileaks is a solid definitive source for the article about critical foreign dependencies initiative the unsourced items came from this reliable source i have been debating the sourcing issues with elonka on 
 stay off it 
 sure just let me know where you would like my as you obviously are unable to face the criticism which has been directed at you from various editors some of it referenced in the present discussion 
 i stopped participating in that thread a long time ago mostly because i discovered i was discussing a topic with people who didnt know what they were talking about i dont require your dubious warnings so you can stop making them 
 thanks in advance 
 im sure i have no idea what you are attempting to convey to me __ 
 meco bxfN ri is asking for your help with an ip who vandalized his user page 
 where do i ask this question on wikipedia 
 bxfN ri i see you reverted his edits i will warn him on his talk page if it happens again you can report him at 
 these links should give you some information its un unregistered user who has not talk page or user page of course they have no right to write things on your user page which you do not approve of if you want i can place a warning to them not to do it anymore __ 
 thank you 
 hi and mdash seems that the pages 
 yeah i saw thata little too late im afraid d sorry about that 
 if possible please revert the images as licensed as the uploaders own work 
 i wasnt the one who blocked 
 i am very concerned about the behaviour of viriditas in 
 i think ani is the appropriate forum and i believe there are more editors who are concerned about the behavior of this user as i just wrote things may be coming to a head for them at this particular junction so i would like to wait out the current climax to see if things calm down a bit i would also like to add that since i have been explicitly asked to stay away from their talk page viriditas extend the same restraint with regards to the present page __ 
 i have opened an an or i about 
 thanks in advance 
 on another note i know that you are quite active on the german wikipedia and thats the first nonenglish wiki i was planning on making vp available for if you have some available time i could certainly use your help with a few things

 just like to point something out every other encyclopedia in existance lists charles as king of spain so why not wikipedia also a book i read called the life and times of martin luther stated in a letter written either by charles or on his behalf called him emperor elect of the romans king of germany spain the two sicilies etc 
 after you deleting my response to the above msg thought you didnt like people talking behind your back smile 
 i just looked at the faq and it said to turn off enhanced recent changes ehanced recent changes has always been off so it certainly isnt that 
 oye rather embarassing but it appears that function may still be dependent upon popups you might try adding to 
 thanks for the help 
 hi i saw your message about watchlists on your user page if you are interested there is a solution but it involves using subpages what this means is that your watchlist would be accessible to the public what you could do is reserve your personal watchlist for private pages and then create a public watchlist then you can create either one or many watchlists with no limit on the size it might help if you organize by project topic or some other sorting criteria you can even view all the watchlists on a single page which is kind of neat 
 i dont follow you you do realize its the page where is displayed that is the problem the actual watchlist has over N entries and a systematic pruning of it is not on the agenda could you try and explain what you have in mind a bit more specifically __ 
 well i cant be more clear than i already have 
 i contacted you previously about vandalism on the 
 well it looks like about three to four cases of vandalism a day which is about average for any article and almost all of the vandalism is reverted within a couple of minutes the articles on the irc watchlists my watchlist and the watchlists of many others as well so if i were you i wouldnt worry about drastic measures such as protection are avoided unless the situation gets completely out of control unfortunately opencontent sources like wikipedia will always be common targets for vandalism but if you look at articles such as well 
 right this looks promising i think i can patch together an article with this __ 
 i have not recieved any information about my prior requests to use vandalproof please clarify this 
 it would appear you added nowiki tags before and after your username which caused it to not be recognized correctly and was thus accidentally as the lists arent moderated by hand formatting is rather important and incorrect formatting can lead to mishaps like this sorry about the confusion you are a little below the standard limit but you look to have been around for a while and seem to be trustworthy i will gladly add you 
 absolutely i have been expecting it __ 
 yep definitely 
 nice thanks for the barnstar 
 hello you recently added to 
 i have redirected the stub to 
 as far as i know this has nothing to do with the united states diplomatic cables leak also you make damning assessment of the sources without having even read them __ 
 it looks like you are the one who hasnt read the sources it is getting news coverage because people are looking through the wikileaks cable release for supporting documents again wikipedia is not wikinews 
 why cant you just admit i was right and move the page to anaheim hills california i proved my point and i dont appreciate you not taking responsibility in admiting you were wrong i will pursue it with higher figures than you so that your admin abuse and deception will end i will continue to promote the move to anaheim hills and if you wont move it for me i have no choice but to copy and paste 
 as i have explained before this has absolutely nothing to do with who is right and who is wrong this has to do with your inexcusable movewarring and otherwise disruptive behavior if you or any of your other sockpuppets or ips forks this article again you will be blocked i have no interest in taking a side on this issue at all i merely want you to recognize that your behavior is entirely unacceptable counterproductive and not particularly persuasive 
 i dont see the point of it wikipedia isnt a dictionary and the only other ridicule entry i could find is an episode of 
 its the N views limit that makes me keep track of recent changes if im away from wikipedia for more than N uN hours __ 
 i too see no reason for the move and have reverted it you didnt update any of the incoming links nor make any use of the freedup article title 
 hi i saw that you are planning to develop a german version of vandalproof as im coming from dewp actually please tell me if i can help you in any way regards 
 yes i can certainly use all the help i can get unfortunately im having to save my interwiki release for another day however i will certainly need some help in the relatively near future let me get back to you in about a week or so thank you for the offer 
 sure just drop me a note on my talkpage or send me a mail whenever you find time 
 fvasconcellos im not sure about the round the pmids eubulides has also questioned them i think that the fact that the pmids are blue and have a hyperlink symbol is enough of a visual distraction without markup and presumably colour and link symbols arent governed by the vancouver style i see you moved the pmids after the dois dont mind either way on that im not sure what punctuation should surround the doi and pmid bits do you think we need a trailing period after the pmid number thoughts im happy to make any changes so im not asking you to revert and im grateful for your help here 
 by all means go ahead and remove them i could go either way on trailing periods although i prefer withoutuN if you have a personal preference that will be fine sorry i havent been of much help lately 
 i appreciate your notifying me of your action im reading the above after having reverted you and posted a note on your talk page __ 
 please only remove links to deleted articles if the topic is nonnotable and should never have an article on it if the article was deleted for being nonsense badly written etc the links are very useful for people who would like to write a good article on the topic 
 well i suppose its sort of a matter of personal discretion as to what topics are actually notable the majority of nonsense articles are speedily deleted whilst the majority of prods are for concerns of notability and or or advertising in which case the incoming links should be removed however i do sort of have redlinkphobia and often get carried away removing links so thanks for keeping an eye on me d if you feel i mistakenly remoed any links please feel free to revert me 
 of yours removed from the nomination an entire sentence (the one about 
 yes that was a mistake i should have watched my steps a bit more carefully __ 
 no longterm harm done i think the mystery of what was happening was stressing hmains out though 
 im not wyatt __ 
 what step should be taken next iyo 
 is everyone agreeing except that one editor 
 yes that editor is the only one 
 is he making personal attacks and is anyone making personal attacks on him 
 removal of that category is an admin action as an administrator i am declining to block the user because their username is not a violation of the policy as i explained to you on my talk page the only circumstances in which a nonadmin should revert an admin action such as this or a declined speedy deletion for example is in the case of a clear mistake if you want to revert admins in other circumstances please go to 
 well you havent responded to my latest post on your talk page and this username is a blatant violation of the username rules please respond to my previous post __ 
 because i missed it my talk page is so busy it has to be archived more often than the admins noticeboard since we are not going to agree amongst ourselves i respectfully suggest that you take the matter to rfc or n which is a venue set up to deal with exactly these kinds of disputes but please dont keep readding the category it only makes my job of cleaning out 
 fine you missed however i just reminded you of it so could you please respond to it now and address the point i am making there sending me off to 
 could i ask you a favour could you review your block of 
 unblocked sorry that was my first block of the day and its quite early d he is still nearly in violation of N rr though so the block may well be reinstated 
 fair enough thanks for understanding 
 while content with and accepting the review you have just made i would mention that i did draw the users attention very clearly to wpnot i agree that it is a close call between content dispute and vandalism in cases like this however 
 i didnt delete 
 and ideas i like you i am N per cent nonvandal as i stated before i have too much respect for the hard working users who created wikipedia m sorry if i upset you earlier in attacking american brit i will apoligize to him on his talk page again i am on your side i will not tolerate N per cent christian N etc or bbcitv so are we at peace now 
 sure as long as your intentions are true 
 i think the term list might be better than the word cronology also you might want to consult the 
 the webscreenshot tag is meant to apply to screenshots of webpages not individual graphic or graphs from those pages 
 please understand that wikipedia is intended to be in the 
 regards 
 where is the assertion of notability made 
 with a small scientific and medical team oneill uncovered the vaule of aminomics in treating cancer and many other aminomic and proteomic based disease i believe that constitutes an assertion of notability 
 the page 
 i blocked the ranges N or N and N or N for N minutes each and will reblock for longer if they start up again thanks to bug N we now dont really have to worry to much about aol collateral damage i may protect the page as well let me look at it really quick we cant however indefblock an aol ip range so thats out of the question 
 could you protect my user page permanently (
 done let me know when you return 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our 
 added fair use rationale and removed the disputed template from the image page can you please check it and make sure it is all good thanks 
 hello i was just approved for use of the tool but currently the program doesnt accept my user name it doesnt accept the last character i rewrote mycounttxt and saved as utfN document but it doesnt work and i fail to login i dont know you will fix this or not anyway please let me know if fixed 
 ooh that could be a problem let me try tweaking a few things to see if i can get it to work for you which it hopefully will in the next release until then if youd like to create second account to use vandalproof i will gladly see to it that it gets approval sorry about that 
 i cant use the my watchlist recent changes and user contribs tabs because it seems its not working how do i use it 
 what do you mean by not working a few things make sure you are not using enhanced recent changes which can be set under my preferences within wikipedia you may also try clearing out your internet explorer temporary internet files and cookies especially if you are getting any kind of script warnings as corrupt tif files cause a lot of pesky little problems 
 hey i noticed that you have previously reverted an edit at 
 well this is a highly politicized issue so we must expect a few of cass sunsteins cybertrolls to descend on it __ 
 i recently submitted myself for use of vandalproof and according to the submission pages history i was approved but i havent received any note of it so now should i just download the software 
 you were approved and i apologize if you didnt receive any notification go ahead and download it although i am planning on releasing version N within the next N hours so you may want to wait d 
 hi im trying to add the status changer you use to my userpages i have added everything fine i just dont seem to be able to get a way of change the status other than by manually editing the statusdiv should there be some buttons created somewhere i have copied the relevant section from your monobook but it doesnt seem to be working 
 i dont think copying that template is a very good idea maybe you think it looks nice in the monobook skin but it hides inportant elements of the interface in other skins or 
 i looked at your monobookjs and it looks just fine to me it should add after your my contributions link a link you may need to copy parts of my monobookcss to get it work for you and it may also have some problems with internet explorer if youd rather have the links in your toolbox i can gladly modify it to work like that for you 
 hi thanks for your quick reply it seems to be working fine now you can probably see from my monobook that its got quite a lot of stuff in i saw a few other interesting sounding things in your monobook so i may have a play around with those this week 
 any chance youd be willing to help revive this project 
 i would be delighted to make an attempt at that if not for the fact that im currently having an extended 
 if you know any wikipedians who might be interested in that case wed appreciate it my students and i will likely be working on N articles over the course of the fall semester and would appreciate any help or guidance or pointings in the right direction you might be able to give 
 theres a problem with this type of articles on wikipedia some such articles are politically sensitive in todays climate that means that factions will want to present them in a biased fashion often those factions will fight those who have no vested interests but who simply want to present the facts so as to elucidate the topic of the articles and instill the best understanding of the subject matter possible in the reader in such cases the former group usually wins sometimes even driving the latter faction off of wikipedia altogether through provocations and trumped up prosecutions leaving them banned from editing __ 
 when i click on the button to update my vandalismlog file it says its updated but the file doesnt actually change the vandalismstats file does get updated when i do that button

 thank you for your comment i did find your talk page after user multiworlds started deleting multiple times on my talk page and also deleted content i had posted in the michael deibert article over N times without much any discussion since i was unable to have a constructive talk with multiworlds i thought responding to multiworlds comments on your talk page might at least lead to a dialogue i hope that was ok 
 its fine its just that i dont do much wikipedia anymore im not sure why that other user decided to talk to me hopefully someone will deal with it at the noticeboard

 you added a merge tag on this article way back in december N since then it has been edited several hundred times but there has been no discussion since january N i am going to remove the merge tag i have done a lot of work to fix that article by removing all the extraneous junk adding the N #N albums and adding a ref to every single item on the page i think it can now stand on its own rather than get merged into a related topic that has issues of its own 
 you are right about the duplication and i think it might be a good idea to merge it with 
 hi there ami daniel i was just wondering whether you could help us move gothic literature to gothic fiction as that seems to be the consensus on the talk page 
 done and i also fixed up the redirects let me know if i can do anything else for you im always glad to help d 
 thanks a lot ami 
 how do i get listed as a verified user for wpop im not quite sure how to verify open proxies based on what i get back from the checking tools but im willing to help out if someone gives me a quick guide thanks 
 well the last time i checked the vcn checker was down however i will gladly give you login details to use it you may also try kevinbreits slightly buggy irc proxy checker found at #vcnpscan on the freenode network if you need authorization to use it again just msg me once you feel confident that you can verify open proxies let me know and i will see about getting you on the list 
 or styleverticalalign top bordertop N px solid gray or i hereby award you this da vinci barnstar for your awesome programming work in creating vp many a wikiarticle has been saved because of you thanks 
 hey thanks for the barnstar im glad you find the tool useful and i hope my future releases will be equally as satisfying 
 im going to assume that you are the anon who was reverted by im not sure entirely why the edit was reverted as i would not have reverted it myself however the person to talk to about it would be 
 hey thanks for letting me know and sorry i didnt get to say anything in the drv feel free to drop me a note if the user causes you any more trouble and i will gladly respond to him 
 good to see you are back actually 
 oh i almost forgot i started an 
 yeah i have got socalled chaos and under rug swept and i gave in and got jagged little pill not too long ago 
 the reason i added the year is because otherwise the date formatting doesnt work as can be seen in the quote above 
 it doesnt affect only iso date formats it affects all date formats other than the month day year format with a uk date setting it would be rendered as february N uN N march N i dug up an old discussion about this 
 oops i guess i just assumed it wouldnt change the formatting of monthday dates with the uk setting since it doesnt with the iso setting thanks for letting me know 
 do you know anything about this account to be on safe side i blocked it for now based on 
 so far has made only two edits both redirecting the user and user talk pages to 
 not my doing nor so far as i know the doing of anyone else affiliated with the vp project probably a vandalism account id guess and in any case and inappropriate username 
 are we talking about to create a wikilink you simply add two square brackets before and after the words you want to link for example 
 your user page should not exist it simply links back to your talk page your user page should be used for talking about yourself not a cheap redirect therefore i have fixed up the page for you if this is the way you want your user page to be please accept my apologies for editing it 
 i understand now and as such have reverted the edit i made 
 i take exception to the fact that you banned me for N hours and 
 it would appear that the article was deleted by a consensus at 
 thanks for your support in my rfa thanks also for the words you said in your support rationale i didnt know you had seen a lot of my work thanks for noticing my work here 
 thanks funny image 
 thanks for the cited casting addition uN 
 alright i will see about adding it when articles mention female interest like that it usually means a female character with which a protagonist is romantically involved uN 
 please see the 
 pardon me 
 since you are an admin i wanted to see if you agreed with my featured article nomination of it thats all 
 ahh okay well im not particularly involved in the fa process however i will gladly take a look at it here in a bit 
 thanks no its nothing serious more like a nuisance 
 every single paragraph is accurately sourced to the shrimadbhagavatam a very important and popular hindu book every single paragraph has its own source so how can you say it is unsourced or personal research i spent hours on this page and made sure i sourced every single thing i wrote please let me know it is sourced on in every paragraph it is much better sourced than naraka which barely has any sources in this article every thing i wrote i provided a source underneath thank you 
 it seems that there is a recurring theme on this discussion page mhking is be deleting numerous new articles when in fact there are good reasons to keep them 
 hello extraordinary machine you seem to have a lot of experience with naming conventions and other moves would you mind giving input in a topic i started at 
 thanks replied back with some more information 
 wow thats a highly impressive number of articles its almost like the bot is running as planned how you generate them so quickly i have no idea but its faster than even i could do keep up the good work 
 yes odd how they are marked as patrolled as soon as they are created but the log says nothing could i ask why there is no more specific citation than a wikilink to geonames 
 i would add sources to the stubs except i dont trust geonames is there some other source of data you are using 
 every time i look at a map using the coordinates it provides i find that its chances of pointing directly to the town are slim this is a result of their rounding to the nearest 
 being within N km is fine for los angeles but look at one you just created 
 i tried to experiment but geonames doesnt do the us im pretty sure the larger cluster to the north is xuN luN c because when i looked in geonames map view there was no other town labelled there the first google search i do is an image search believe it or not 
 the google search didnt help there are other places named xuN luN c and khaladzh that interefere with the search but seriously nada 
 i have to know has this got you worried about the quality of geonames if i pick one of the ones that is only accurate to the arc minute will it be worse 
 one would have to compare towns of equal size to see if gnis is more accurate than geonames i will look for an example in gnis 
 there are major differences between gns and gnis for example 
 gnss mandate is to provide uniform spelling of place names they can and do have outdated or incorrect information on the location of towns it is also possible that they mislabel a feature as a populated place when they meant to key in something else where did you get the fact the 
 the rounding i view as a symptom of uncertainity on the part of the people who created the entry some of the data goes back to before wwii and you still havent explained the cases of 
 hi i see you removed the awardwinning intro on stones article im not complaining at all i just wanted to know why it is considered pov 
 i think i got it its just that i removed this same intro from the 
 i will thank you so much you are just so helpful i hope im not disturbing you i mean im still new at these things 
 hey thanks for sorting out that so called backlog when i said backlog i didnt mean heaps i meant time one of them was checked in mid july and still waiting block but yeh thanks i was unsure if aiv was the right place to go to get them blocked was it rite ta 
 just thought id add that tag 
 hey thanks please feel free to edit the article and fix any problems or mistakes i have made the more people that want to improve the article the better 
 thanks for all your great work and for catching my mistake 
 that was awesome 
 how the hell did you do that 
 im guessing the same way that he did and mdash 
 one final thing during my last reread the paragraph on his influence on chicano teatro was really bugging me it just didnt seem concise i dont remember if i wrote it or not but if it were more fluid i think itd improve our chances on getting it to fa paz pues 
 i havent made much progress in the pilcher bio yet but already i can tell that much is missing for example the difference or overlap or conflation between moreno and cantinflas criticism and his interpretation of the masculine gender role and i think more elaborate comparisons or contrasts between him groucho and chaplin are warranted what did you think of the star shot like i said i wouldnt mind trimming it down or removing it unless the community likes it and what did you think about runewelshs comments well im back to work stay up 
 verified proff that nothing that you are is the next single you officially made and ass out of your self how does it feel 
 yeah w or e proven wrong again ran your emouth about how i make up things you were just so sure you were right just like with extraordinary proven wrong again do find a day job 
 not a problem at all it was deleted on N dec N and so we still have its deleted history available i went ahead and restored it to 
 hi 
 thank you so much i changed it up a bit when i uploaded this 
 hey ami daniel as we talked about i would like to pull articles from a days prod activity and append this message 
 feel free to comment at 
 why did you remove the photo i added of her as far as i can tell the manual of style says nothing about photos that would justify removing it if you just dont like the photo thats fine im just curious whats going on here 
 ok thanks not a big deal 
 nothing on that template says that they are a system administrator on another system that template should only be used by wikipedia system administrators and to do otherwise is being an imposter 
 hmm well it seems to me that the template being sorted under 
 you know aaliyahs dead right theres no way she can produce another album am i missing something >> 
 it wouldnt be unheard of 
 im confusedwhy the madge lyrics 
 i took it to 
 okay i will go comment there then 
 thank you for working on the production section of the article 
 i would appreciate if you could get back to me N N august N 
 appears to have been reverted by antivandalbot within the same minute 
 i will email you this as well however since the editor who submitted that was not logged in at the time its relatively easy to retrieve at least some information about who it is the ip address he used is to eircom networks ltd in dublin ireland to request more information about the individual or ask that the isp take action against the individual please go to http or or supporteircomnet or abuse or or send an email to abuse@eircomnet and be sure to include the users ip address N anyway thats about all that i can do for you regarding this however please let me know of any other way that i can help 
 is there a release date for N or at least a ballpark estimate 
 erm as soon as i finish patching up a couple of minor bugs could be within a couple of hours could be a week there is a beta prerelease available and if you are interested please drop by #vandalproof on the freenode network and i will set you up 
 someone has cutandpasted your page for the tool into the main article space i dont think it belongs there but i will leave it to you to decide what to do with it 
 i already deleted it d 
 thats it for this newsletter edition everyone any questions or comments are always welcome on the wikicup talk page or our user talk pages until next time 
 i see you operate date script written by lightmouse a discussion at 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or for excellent contributions to a variety of articles i award you this barnstar to acknowledge your work 
 yes i am fine thank you you are very welcome for the barnstar i like to let people know that the work they do here is appreciated and i award them for their contributions thanks also for noticing my work too 
 oh and on an unrelated note you may be interested in the admins tshirt has become good one for thinking of that idea to begin with 
 i made three reverts on saturday and three reverts on sundaythis was to uphold npov against a person who had violated N rr those that agreed with my view including 
 oh sorry i see that you did block brendel but that was unfair as well considering as the reverts werent made in a N hour period 
 im sorry to disagree but yes they were your was at N N aug N your was at N N aug N your was at N N aug N and your was at N N aug N those are your only four reverts within a N hour span on the article however they are N reverts in N hours thus violating N rr im sorry that i had to block you as you are someone i consider to be a quite respectable editor which is thus why i very carefuly reviewed the edits submittedin the end i found that both you and gerdbrendel were in violation of N rr and blocked you both accordingly and fairly gerdbrendel has also written me an email in which he claimed that he was reverting vandalism and should thus be exempt from his N rr block i have yet to respond to his email however i will review this further thanks in advance for your understanding and please feel free in the future to let me know whenever you believe i have acted mistakenly 
 hi schreib deine antwort auf meine email einfach als post auf meine talk page ich habe die selben sorgen we nobleeagle unzwar das dieser eintrag in meinem blocklog meine glaubwxfcrdigkeit schxeN digt ich habe xeN hnlich wie nobleeagle xfcber N beitragungen und habe mir sehr viel mxfche in der bearbeitung von vielen artikeln hier gegeben jezt fxfcrchte ich das andere benutzer meine beitragungen mit mistrauen betrachen werden eine schande nachdem ich mir so angestrengt habe danke fxfcr dein verstxeN ndniss grxfcsse 
 yes i understand i didnt really think before doing the fourth revert considering there were a few hours of sleep between the N rd and N th i wont go into the vandalism issue as it was a pov dispute but in this case we had a consensus and this person was trying to unilaterally change the article to their own beliefs and in doing so ignored consensus they also frequently engaged in personal attacks which didnt help 
 thats why i considered his edits vandalism he was pushing his pov and ignoring consensus regards 
 i was at fault in some ways i guessif you see on my talk page the idea of page protection came to me a tad late a discussion was ongoing at 
 true instead of reverting we should have looked at alternatives soonerthere is simply little sense in continously reverting and discussing with those who are not able to abstain from the use of potentially offensive remarls as nobleeagle said the idea of page protection was brought up to late 
 thanks for any help 
 or a suggestion on whom might be better to ask if you are too busy or arent sure thanks 
 taken elsewhere sall good 
 hi i responded to your comment 
 a draft userspace article has been created please see 
 hi thanks happy new year for you too long time no talk well i was considering using the billboard charts former names in articles about singles that entered the charts at the time they had those names but i wasnt quite sure about the exact issue date the charts had their names changed so i realised this would be pretty complicated by the way do you know the exact date thanks again hope you are having a fabulous N too 
 yeah i think that helps what about an artist article mentioning singles that charted before and after the name change should i use the former name for the single which charted before and the current name for the single which charted after 
 i agree with your opinion and yes i also think this could be brought up at 
 no problem i will keep an eye on talkrecord charts so that i get know what was decided 
 one more question would you classify joss stone as rhythm and blues or contemporary r and b well im not sure if you know what her music sounds like just wanted someone elses opinion 
 yup her first two albums had a purely N s or N s rhythm and blues or soul sound but her latest release mixes traditional r and b or soul with contemporary r and b neo soul and hip hop thanks a lot anyway d 
 hi i have been assembling some help text for the vp menus at 
 i have copied your post to 
 how do you become an administrator on the 
 never mind i found the requests for permissions page 
 i noticed on vandalproof that i have been warned with a warning even though there has not been such a case i hope that you can resolve this problem thanks 
 i presume you are referring to the person to contact would be 
 unfortunately that is not the edit the warning that is shown on vp is dated june N not august N others have also found it strange 
 im not sure how exactly you are getting this impression however adding links to your websites and films to N some odd articles is simply not acceptable wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection or external links nor is it a vehicle for advertising please also understand that on wikipedia writing about and referencing yourself and projects in which you are involved is highly discouraged in the future when you believe that an article or series of articles may benefit from certain links consider discussing such changes on the articles talk page or in a public forum such as 
 seems like someone created a similar article on this 
 hi im working on the backlog at 
 has just now speedily redeleted the template you restored per consensus at drv with a nearly identical summary possibly he discussed this offsite but not anywhere i can see 
 scratch that he missed my messages at his user talk somehow or other its been restored and moved to 
 awwbut i was just spreading the love 
 well aint that sweet unfortunately our articles are not the most appropriate place to do that we are trying to build an encyclopedia after all 
 hi did you read the article the quote is taken from the entry read it carefully im returning the information as it was sourced and relevant to the article as she specifically marvels at mias style on her first album in the entry 
 thanks for your reply what links furtados opinion of mias album and the recording of loose is the timing of the entry the sounds present on loose what some reviewers have pointed out in terms of similarities and furtados praise of the style and flow of mia seeing as she says she is rrecording my new albumwoohoo it is very excitingi am thinking and writing and recording everyday at the beginning it makes sense to list this artist as an inspiration interestingly she mentions looking foward to the new system of a down record in mid may in the entry which is also cited as a band she listened to on the 
 i read both articles and where she mentions these other musicians listed on the 
 the article is currently on afd 
 yah i read the edit of mine and it was quite bad the spelling and clarification and theres the missing url i was in hurry that time anyway i am open when it comes to my errors in writing english is our second language i presume yeah really need help for now thanks for that happy to work with you guys 
 thanks for the compliment 
 by the way 
 hey do you think i should start a fa vote for the patriots article this weekend 
 nods the only gaping hole i see is the lead which is one of my achilles heals 
 i was bored so i decided to fix up some minor errors and start the fac debate that way if theres objections i can fix them while sitting around doing nothing ^_^ 
 thanks in advance my friend and thank you again for the nomination 
 you have to stop doing that stollery or gien or glen s by the way could i get the N version how would i do that 
 thanks but i did copy the syntax etc from 
 mmm well not really there might be a slight change i will keep you posted 
 what basically happened is that a large spree of vandalism came from a rather wide range of ips resulting in your being blocked and the message being left on your talk page you are connected via bell canada an isp which connects all of its users dynamically through a wide range of ips leaving us little ability to contact with and block individual users sorry for the inconvenience however to avoid being confused by similar messages in the future you might consider registering for an account 
 sorry thats my job d 
 about the program its just filling in a template and posting it to wikipedia the data im using come from the italian wikipedia (
 hi me again i have received the final approval to run the bot but i would like to hear more about the comments you had on attribution etc is there any way i can improve the text of the template that would take away your worries 
 thank you for your message i will continue to add articles if there are problems with the data i will do my best to solve them for example by doing a bot run on the created articles to remove the problematical data 
 hi i am 
 vandalproof is just a piece of software that provides a few tools to simplify countervandalism workhaving access to vp does not entitle you to any other administrative permissions such as page protection you can read more about it at 
 hey ami long time no talk i havent been on wp much in the past few months and that trend will probably continue for the most part for the foreseeable future so if you want to remove my status as a vp mod feel free to do so although it hasnt happened yet i wouldnt want someone to contact me and expect a reply as i wouldnt be of much help anyway thanks and see you around 
 yes i have been quite preoccupied with other things of late and havent had nearly as much time for wikipedia as i used toi presume its a similar situation for you anyway if you no longer want to be a mod its not a problem at all to remove you and if you ever wish to return please let me know thank you so much for all of your help over these last monthsits much appreciated 
 i dont know if you had seen my request for N + mod so i will bring it up again second your header interferes with the redirected from notice thirdly i want to apologize for being so inactive lately i will actually unable to edit at all for a while sorry 
 hi i have been on the awaiting approval list for over N hours 
 the list hasnt moved in a while where are the mods 
 hello i notice the screen shots you have uploaded of vp have been tagged as which marks them as being used under fair use but arent you the copyright holder if so could you please update the licencing of the images in question to a free licence of your choice as per 
 he doesnt own the icon for vandalproof or the graphical elements of winxp fuwss makes life easier and anyone with half a mind can see the reasoning behind an exception to 
 amidaniel if it turns out that you are not the copyright holder as suggested above this creates a different problem in that fair use images can only be used in article space 
 hi fv could you please take a look at 
 hey ed that image was originally supposed to be of molybdopterin not molybdenum cofactor then it was changed on request etc unfortunately i cant create svgs right now so please keep using the png for the time being thanks for letting me know 
 according to 
 i undid the references and rarrreflist change in your other awb edit from today but not from any of the earlier ones please feel more than welcome to quickly run through my recent contributions with with awb to redo the other changes and mdash and nbspcarl ( 
 also at nll is less than constructive it is not a contest wp is 
 gosh darn i added lol which im sure you know lots of laughs it was you who said so far only you think and i pointed out that others are weighing in on the discussion also you said i was trying to foist my views as i pointed out not hardly i am looking for that consensus as well and bold discussion is part of the process while i initiated the proposal your comments have been most constructive and i thank you for them 
 can you please provide your input on 
 according to the talk page this is one of the issues of dispute please consider discussing the issue with other contributors and attaining consensus for this change 
 i think that if we can get people motivated including people like yourself who are willing to consider it a major part of the wikiwork we can get to N maybe even N before the end of the year once wikisort comes on line we may start to get deluged with user assessments i think we are getting well into #N and we need to start working on #N and #N in fact N N and N are all interrelated when we organise a subject area we may then need to start tracking down certain sets of articles if sj or someone else can get a nice version of the tree or we come up with some better alternative then i think that would greatly help with #N do you see the project differently please elaborate busy in the lab today N students working away so id better get on cheers 
 if you have uploaded other files consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them too you can find a list of files you have uploaded by following unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged as described on 
 thank you for adding the source information uN 
 hi despite repeated attempts i am completely unable to get vandalproof to work for me at all every time it says that my login request has failed i have tried launching vp while logged in to my wikipedia account on both firefox and ie i have also logged in to wikipedia via the link in the vp page but i still end up with the same login request failed error xyrael tried some things to fix the problem but none of them worked im trying to use version N of vp can you help 
 hi is there any hope that this problem will ever be fixed if not i guess i will just forget about the idea of using vp 
 hello i seem to be unable to log into vp and i have no idea why whenever i try to log in vp either crashes or gives the your login request failed message the latter occurs after i first get the login succesful note from wp the application worked just fine previously but this problem appeared a while ago 
 hi i also had the problem you describe last night however i persisted and on the third attempt it did not crash 
 whats going on with the vandalproof waiting list its been static for at least a week now 
 i noticed this too i can go through the list for you if you are too busy just let me know what the requirements are and i will make a list of who meets it and who doesnt im not busy this weekend got lots of time uN 
 yeah i was wondering why my application from around a week back hadnt been approved ah well it gave me the chance to well and truly be able to apply for it 
 you are requested to offer your comment in the dispute involving inter alia your name outlined 
 since there has been no response from you in over a week now i would like to invite you to revert your action of N and nbspseptember and nbspN by removing the 
 i reverted to 
 the show can have some dialogue and still be 
 it wouldbe very nice if you get get your program to work on an osx mac using either safari or firefox i recongize this may be too much work for a specialized program but if there were one more could help 
 well im currently working on a program similar to vandalproof but with many more gizmos that will be usable on any foundation wiki but it wont be available for another couple of months however vpN has the ability to be easily adapted for multiple wikis if you or someone else would be willing to spend some time translating string tables id have no problem adapting it for frwiki i will try to get back to you in a few days but if i dont please feel free to nag me 
 no problem for string tables translation what should i do to request permission to use vandalproof for frwiki i must register 
 i will be far away from my computer for one week you can give the string table after november the N rd thanks 
 if you have uploaded other unlicensed media please check whether they are used in any articles or not you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the 
 orphaned i think not 
 so my point is that when dealing with successor characters we go back to the very basicconcept itself and ask ourselves what are we writing about why does this article exist in the first place then following hierarchies of division like i have laid out we determine where to split and where to merge of course this is excluding article length i feel a large part of the issue is dealing with character biographies when it ocmes to merging succesor character articles we shouldnt refrain from stripping down the bios to the barest of essential because ultimately its not the character itself thats important but what that character adds to the understanding of the greater concept 
 an editor removed your additions once because they were uncited and you reverted without comment i reverted again also citing like of sources for the removal i have no more authority than you i dont think my time as a wikipedian or edit count make me any better than you in terms of authority or as a person i do have more experience than you so i feel a little more comfortable making some edits than you might you are always free to question another editors actions as you are doing now if you want to readd that information you need to bring it up on the talk pages for those articles because two editors so far have called those additions into question 
 dont ask me i didnt remove it again you may want to register 
 more so you have never had to clean up after my latenight halfasleep article overhauls the majority of the work is good but then there are all those little instance of misspelled or missing words 
 if you think you can help please do thanks for your time 
 i do hope you can help and that this grows into a longerterm commitment we are working very hard to set the bar for quality with milhist articles and quality copyediting is an essential part of this with apologies again for the tardy reply 
 i must mention that i know you originally had meant to redirect this to the album article the notice was automatic i am going to notify the main contributor of the article but of course your opinion is appreciated and nbsp 
 you are requested to offer your comment in the dispute involving inter alia your name outlined 
 since there has been no response from you in over a week now i would like to invite you to revert your action of N and nbspseptember and nbspN by removing the 
 please remerge the 
 again stop using we articles are written in the third person uN 
 sorry just forgot 
 haunted angel i am not editing under the name ghost user i swear i have changed from vandalism to a good guy what do i have to do to prove it to you i guess i will have to sign in and create an account to seperate myself from my past on wikipedia 
 then you do that the admins have the ability to see your ip they will decide if you are the vandal 
 hi i got this response from the uploader what do i do with it now 
 fv when do you plan to review best 
 tonight at the latest am reading already 
 i didnt the impressing the ladies business has cropped up from time to time but its not me doing it fwiw thats not something id say about myself in any case i am fully aware of the restriction on autobiography 
 btw thanks for fixing the vandalism i do appreciate the people who do that 
 you missed in your history cleaning 
 thanks for letting me know it slipped in there while i was completing the last history purge should all be cleaned up now hopefully that will be the last time i have to do that d 
 this is an automated notice by 
 woops thanks orphanbot 
 thank you d i havent gotten one of these in a while i suppose i will have to open up 
 i hate to rain on your parade but current 
 hmm just reread that and it sounds a bit arsey i mean well done for all the stuff you did earlier its just that you left it to be protected for N hours at the end of it 
 yes im well aware of the policy on sprotect however these were unique circumstances unfortunately the semiprotection was absolutely vital and it may well have been better to even full protect for a short while it remained sprotected for suprising only two hours considering that the vandal was still at work well over an hour into the sprotection before he tired out im sorry you disagree with my decision but frankly i dont 
 sorry but archives are typically kept for historical purposes and i do not believe it acceptable to blank it just because a remark was made that you found offcolor the only way anyone will ever arrive at that page again is by following deletion logs which will likely only occur in the case of a drv put it behind you and move on 
 put it behind you say are you asking me for something that you would be willing to do in the same situation or that you wouldnt be willing to even at your current wikipedia user level 
 hi i was removed from the request for approval list at the vandalproof and not put on either the approved or denied lists could you tell me why please 
 i think you were put on the recent approval list my question is i downloaded vandalproof and tried to log in and got a message saying it would not let me do i have to wait to be added to the permanent list 
 hi amidaniel could you please look into 
 see i know whats causing it and will hopefully have it fixed in N which will be available for download soon sorry about the inconvenience 
 i was sent the message that i was appoved but im not on the list and vandalproof is not letting me log on uN 
 see it appears some users got lost when i brought the vpN userlist over to the vpN system as somehow users werent be approved by mods for N i will try to add you right away sorry about the inconvenience 
 yes i suspected you werent on the list i have added you again 
 you have been mentioned in an 
 sure i will take a look at it later this evening 
 thanks 
 thanks for that very useful lets just hope that 
 your bot N N may N cmdrobot m changed mens divinor in the 
 sam thanks for that i try to watch out for latin phrases like that (most recently i saw one in 
 there is currently a very bothersome 
 yes im aware please see i cant do anything about it right now but you can add your name to 
 it should be established in the introduction which god the article is talking about without having to click on wikilinks 
 replied on article talk page 
 i was wondering if youd allow me the pleasure of porting vandlebot to unixlike operating systems if so would it be possible if i could get my hands on the vandlebot vb source if you are interested im intending to use 
 i presume you mean 
 please report vandals to 
 amidaniel thanks for approving me so i can use vandalproof i really appreciate your thoughtfulness it is my hope that i will make good use of this tool on wikipedia thanks again 
 yeah no problem sorry about the delay in approving you we have had some administrivia issues as of late and i have had no time i hope you find it useful 
 a thank you from me too your quick response is very much appreciated thanks again 
 i am back from break so i will be able to resume moderating now great job with N btw still no button to inform a user that they are not approved though 
 excuse me i was just notifying you i didnt write the message it is written in cheers 
 i didnt say the edit was vandalism i said it was unconstructive please calm down i apologize for making a rude comment but what was the intention of the edit 
 i am so sorry i had a bug with my computer that messed this up i apologize and thanks for my tolerating that man that was a huge mistake thanks 
 do we need to moderate manually now my mod tools are linking to the old N list 
 hmm it looks like it cant be done manually is something wrong in my program 
 alright i have figured out what is going on my awaiting approval list does not load but other then that the mod tools work do you know why this might be 
 it wasnt i who introduced that sentence 
 mainstream is a word to avoid because it indicates that the bates method might somehow be scientific which all but the most triedandtrue believers acknowledge it is not the scientific evidence comes from various opthamology texts scientific evidence is a catchall term for the facts elucidated by a huge discipline its not simply a viewpoint that this is what causes vision loss 
 im not sure what you are getting at the evidence is reported in standard opthamology texts the persistence of the various forms of ametropia is attributed in all the texts referenced to anatomical not physiological conditions 
 no i understand what evidence means perfectly well as far as wikipedia goes we need 
 thanks for the explanation im sorry i was tired and distracted by nonwikipedia things so i got confused about the edit history i still dont understand why maize has been unilaterally declared to be the primary meaning of corn it depends entirely on who you are where you are and what you are hearing or reading as someone pointed out a lot of people in this world read the bible for example and none of the many occurrences of the word corn in the bible refer to maize anyway i give up wikipedia is clearly going to be a uscentric encyclopaedia 
 well that didnt last long did it i suppose im addicted at least to trivial copy editing i have never been good at adding content anyway so maybe i should just stay away from that thanks for the encouragement anyway 
 i suggest you read the past discussions on these problems and make sure you understand 
 thats ok ronz i quite understand 
 hi samueltheghost i have copied most of 
 im very happy with the merge if it stays like that yes i have pollacks book i have carried out some test searches of its text in google and they deliver results for chapter N only so im fairly sure theres no more of it on the net if you ask me direct questions about its content i will answer them 
 i actually emailed 
 im amused by your reference to pollack as rare i bought my copy on abebooks in may this year for ten dollars i observe that there are now just two copies there for sale both at $N or more so i had a bargain as for the article im getting a little worried about the pruning of the corbett section in particular the source for her own opinion should be directly one of her own three books have you got any of them if not i have got two of them and could sort out some pithy phrase to use 
 no unfortunately i dont have any of corbetts books experience leads me to believe that a quote as long as the one that was there will be frowned upon especially if theres no secondary source for it of course we can reference corbetts books but we should also use as many independent sources as we can elwin marg actually quotes her at some length so that may help and somewhere there must be news articles about the case 
 sorry i originally listed this on the rfp page but thats not the place for discussions might i ask why faotd are generally not at least semiprotected the featured picture receives protection for the time it is on the front page it just seems like a natural thing to do to allow editors to focus on building an encyclopdeia rather than protecting it in a case where a page has been made a higher priority target thanks for looking though 
 as an aside i did read 
 the featured picture like the blurb about todays fa is protected because it actually appears on the main page which is a very high visibility page and edits to this elements for shock value can be quite disruptive todays fa and any page linked from the main page however is kept unprotected to encourage new editors to begin editingwhile this results in much obnoxious vandalism and test editing it also demonstrates the anyonecanedit mentality our great countervandalism team and opens many eyes to the way wikipedia works its primarily just an issue of visiting the main page which boasts the encyclopedia anyone can edit and then immediately being led to a page with a nasty notice and a view source tabdoesnt reflect well on wikipedia policy may soon change on this issue but for now lets just grin and bear it 
 the referencing for the 
 corbett avoids saying anything about her own history in her books and the publishers blurb only tells us that she was a pupil of bates ran her school of eye education and that her students included aldous huxley john dos passos and harold heffernan there may be some better source for her but i havent found it of course a search of the press around the time of the trial would certainly yield stuff but i guess it would be hard work finding it 
 a search of the google news archives doesnt seem to yield anything about the case though there are a few mentions of corbett i really wish more of pollacks book would show up online somewhere for now perhaps you could make the referencing more clear in the section 
 thanks that was helpful 
 what i kind of rebel against is more the use of an animal pic in the flora section than anything else though i also tried to solve the other comment about text between two pictures 
 thanks for the message i will reply on the fac page thanks 
 in the 
 probably the bottom but it truthfully makes no difference generally once a mod gets around to dealing with requests on that page s or he clears it all in one breath the order is generally irrelevant unfortunately due to some bugs in the mod tools this process is somewhat difficult for mods at the moment thus the delay but we are working on sorting it out thanks for your patience 
 i noticed an 
 thanks for that i need to ponder the question for a little time before deciding whether and how to comment 
 hi amidaniel i was a happy user of vp N and recently im no longer on the approved list there also appears to be a backlog of users requesting approval can you have a look at it for me and see if you could approve some of us who have for some reason lost the approval cheers 
 same here 
 i did not see him specifically referring to you is there some other interchange of which i am unaware 
 no there has been no other interchange at the time i wrote that message his words were the ones pushing against him are some usual fringe suspects which clearly includes me i note that he has refactored at your behest and thank you for that i dont think i have acted wrongly but im very willing to let the matter drop and move on 
 whyd you delete the english wikipedia thanks its contributors for creating N articles thing on the main page 
 the article talk page is for discussions on how to improve the article not to gossip about other editors if you are concerned with allegations of conflicts of interest please do so in a proper forum thanks 
 lol 
 i would argue that N rr does not apply when i am restoring references that have been removed without comment which is akin to vandalism all attempts to start a discussion have been ignored 
 i understand why you feel that way however im going to stand by my opinion that you are both in violation of N rr if the user continues to edit war on the article please contact me rather than revert lest you be blocked as well 
 semiprotection please 
 lol again this is making my day 
 as long as you can learn to follow wikipedia behavioral guidelines 
 an editor has asked for a 
 i have responded to the the deletion review 
 i think it would be best that your remove or heavily refactor your accusations against unnamed editors here again article talk pages are for discussions on how to improve the article not to attack or harass other editors thanks 
 i take it that wikilawyering driven by antibates pov pushing is the phrase you dont like i have to say that i see i think it would be best to use the sources we have to discuss how absurd the bates method truly is as an explicit desire to push an antibates pov as for wikilawyering i think that fundamental policies both allow and require in this case the use of modern probates source properly contextualised as evidence of what the bates method now means thus it is fair to characterise the many references which have been made to other less fundamental policies in order to prevent that use as wikilawyering 
 if you are unable to follow wikipedias behavioral guidelines then you might just want to stop editing wikipedia altogether otherwise you will likely find yourself extremely frustrated with the problems that you cause and the actions taken by others to resolve them 
 interesting essay applicable to the above discussion 
 indeed thanks for drawing my attention to it 
 i have created http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or wikipediamediation_cabal or cases or robert_prechter in response to the furious debate at 
 further a previous attempt at mediation failed at what point should arbitration be requested 
 since you presented a strong case for making 
 i dont know whether it was the sobering effect of being blocked or the numbing effect of my verbiage but things seem to have calmed down lets hope it lasts 
 now that i read back i admit i was wrong im sorry for bothering you like i did 
 apology accepted 
 in response to your comment at 
 ok i have done that thanks 
 hi samueltheghost thank you very much for posting the information about the woods report in 
 yes indeed if i discover such a study i will certainly let you and wikipedia know but i suspect that there isnt one 
 would you then support deleting the ophthalmological research section from the article 
 i observe that its already gone on balance i think that thats an improvement 
 yes i merged and condensed it into modern variants i dont know if that will stick though 
 hey i got the header style from 
 ^_^ thanks for the message 
 may i please have vp power i love fighting vandals 
 hey why vp approvals are stopped too many users are waiting for approval 
 yeah i agree i put my name on the approval list two days ago and still havent received any message about it is everyone going on vacation or something ~~
 thanks 
 the school is N kilometres away from townsville cbd it is N kilometres from the boarder between townsville and thuringowa i would have thought the N kilometre reference is valid but have to specify that the cbd is the milestone cheers 
 thanks yes maybe adding cbd would work but again what is the big hurry in getting rid of thuringowa is it really that badim at a loss as to what the big deal is and i will say it yet again is it still a city to bad what some people think that is what it is but yet it has to be removed from everything and some users think its funny to add speedy deletes to the thuringowa pages i madeunreal 
 i have resolved all your comments at 
 figured that and because im extremely 
 rest of them are resolved um i dont like ever do external links i feel that they are kind of a waste of space 
 rest done 
 of course a problem with figuring out what npov means in application to any one article is that parts of the policy especially undue which gets brought up a lot here could be more clear regarding different situations the reason it is not i have realized is that clear policies are difficult to gain anything close to community consensus for nonetheless i was thinking it might be a good idea to start a discussion at 
 i have 
 hi samueltheghost our policy is that biographical article titles reflect the best known name of the subject thus we have an article on 
 its all 
 please remove your edit as a sign of good faith if you take a closer look i was the one who qualified the earlier statements 
 a straightforward reading of what you wrote clearly implied that you associated yourself with the coi accusation and confirms it if you apologise to junsun i will apologise to you and if not not 
 i suggest you take it up at 
 no ronz i have a sense of proportion which is something you need 
 i have removed your personal attack 
 i downloaded vandalproof but it says that im not on the user list how do i get on the user list 
 i found the approval list and added my name 
 i just downloaded version N but for some reason it isnt pulling up the recent changes any idea what im doing wrong cheers 
 okay its working fine now no idea what the problem was 
 to answer on gbs behalf no nothing about a medieval poet was actually at that place it was about a living guy and started when younger john kay was a punk singer who also performed his poetry in pubs in the northso 
 thanks for the information 
 do you read 
 eh i know there is oversight jeffs pretty frustrated i put up an adminbacklog tag there my question would be how long it is advisable to wait on that report before mirroring it at ani sorry if we are being too impatient but there was vandalism on the 
 ani cant do anything to help ping one of the moderators such as myself and we will take care if it as fast as we can only vp mods can access the approval list let me know and ill handle it as fast as i can cheers 
 righto thanks for the tip maybe the abuse page should mention the irc channel as well uN and nbsp 
 finally i want to excuse me about the incidents that happened with the eleazar page because iuN m a new wikipedia user and i had problems for writing the article the image files and for making the suitable references all because of my poor level of english if you think that the article can be improved please let me know thanks
 replied at 
 i dont know how long you have been around wikipedia but just from the sheer number of posts on your talk page you obviously arent a complete newbie maybe you have just never dealt with deletion votes or vandalism i dont know but please do not do that kind of thing again 
 discussion continues 
 thanks 
 it appears that you are very much wanted at 
 could you provide page numbers for the pollack references regarding margaret corbett the snippet view version seems to be gone from google books 
 thanks you didnt have to be quite so precise not that thats a problem as you may have noticed i found a source discussing mansfields book 
 for the review 
 would it be possible for you to do a review of 
 i recently learned that anything published in the us between N and N had its copyright expire after N years if it wasnt renewed this likely explains why quackwatch can reproduce an entire chapter of philip pollacks N book now if we had the entire book online such as at a place like its accessibility would no longer be a problem and at least some of the gardner references could be replaced 
 im sure you are right but surely a better place to put it considering who we are might be more troublingly i detect in what you say a hint for action on my part whether i attempt to take that hint depends on several factors i will need to review the potentialities of the hardware and software available to me and most importantly my willingness to undertake hard work which is slight 
 i actually detest wikisource for multiple reasons first it is difficult there to reproduce something in its original form and secondly anything hosted there can be changed by anyone at any time also if the person submitting something couldnt prove for sure that it was public domain it would likely be deleted now google books has a of pollacks book and i assume that technically only a flip of the switch would be needed to make it full view i just contacted them asking if its copyright status could be checked and the book made fully available if indeed the copyright has expired if i had been able to contact them when i first tried i wouldnt have hinted to you like this 
 thats interesting what you say about wikisource of course its openness to alteration cuts both ways i recently made a few corrections to a document there but of course i could have been introducing errors it does mean that any use of it as 
 hi theres something wrong with vandalproof i cant connect to it can ya get a moderator to help me out thanks 
 please define cant connect 
 so help you help me 
 sometimes you have to login with internet explorer or repeatedly click login until you can verify authorization 
 what do you mean log in repeadedly i just keep clickin what button 
 its still not workin is it possible that it is corrupt thats what the message box says 
 have you registered for authorization on the registration page 
 i just did i didnt know that i had to sign up there though however 
 hello i have vandalproof installed but just dont know how to use it can you help me i read what it is and all but it doesnt teach me how ecactly to revert a page back using 
 disappointed in you fvasconcellos here i am with some sources of questioned reliability on 
 as am i sir drugscom i have used it for ages and never had a complaint seriously as it is a medical food and not a drug 
 hints that an early brand name idea was ketasyn the code name was acN the prescribing information sheet lists some trials those should turn up more sources for you 
 great thanks for finding that 
 i dont think google books is going to do anything however i got the book listed which may or may not help it get online some other way 
 are you able to at least scan the book by my understanding that would be considerably less work than 
 how about i just send the book to you through the post and you do whatever you want and send it back in due course that would only cost me the postage which id find very much less onerous than any alternative we could still respect each others anonymity in every other respect 
 i would not really be comfortable with that arrangement for multiple reasons i wonder if there is some way to prove conclusively that it is out of copyright since that seems to be what it would take for google books to make it full view 
 duchess marie was not the highest titled person in mecklenburg which was one area composed of two grand duchies marie was a minor member of a grand ducal family the highest titled people in mecklenburg would have been the grand dukes of mecklenburgstrelitz and mecklenburgschwerin and their wives who were grand duchesses consensus tends doesnt mean a thing when the articles contain nothing which merits notability indeed notability does not exist here please delete the article or tell me right away so i can start an afd and get it out of the way please note 
 members of the british peerage hold substantive titles and there is no multiplicity of titles as there is in the german system we also dont have articles for children of peers that simply state birth death marriage and children

 thanks for your support i have put the above two sources into the article so that everyone can see them the cambridge guide article by martin banham is similar in the two books he edited but somewhat shorter in the paperback version on the other hand that has the advantage of showing up in google books so its fair enough to cite both of them the harvard paper looks like its a mine of further information which it will take me a little time to digest pardon the mixed metaphor digesting a mine sounds uncomfortable 
 nice work with 
 let me second that you did a phenomenonal job to turn a stub into an fa inside a couple of weeks i still dont know how you managed to do it and to write everything so beautifully too though i have seen in the past how amazingly productive you can be when you get going we have an N encyclopedia of antarctica in our library ref section so i plan to fill out the areas that could use some attention congratulations 
 but if you intend to ignore that at least realize the page is far easier to rectify than line by line wading 
 the discussion found by the link referred to appears to be 
 you closed the afd for 
 woa no it wasnt thanks for catching me on that d nice to know there are people keeping an eye on me 
 i have added you to the seeyou case as an involved party as per my talkpage if you wish feel free to make a statement but bear in mind seeyou hasnt commented yet and the case may be delayed to wait for it apologies for not adding you sooner 
 thanks 
 why is there a big list of people to be approved at 
 i apologizetheres lately been a shortage of list moderators and some technical troubles preventing the approval process from working as it was designed to also not helping has been my absence over the past two months and while i currently have no where near the time for wikipedia matters as i used to i will be attempting to resolve these problems as soon as i possibly can for now im just going to have to ask you to be patient until i can make some repairs to the software and until one of our very few and very overworked moderators can get around to processing your request thanks 
 hi daniel as usual i would be more than happy to help but as you probably know i cant as my old username is listed as a moderator let me know if this changes 
 gahh still feel free to play around with 
 i added glen_s and removed gien 
 list cleared 
 would you like to contribute to a new discussion on the talk page of the above about turning that article into a redirect as it appears to be a content fork thanks 
 thanks very much for bringing this to my attention for the time being i prefer to hang back and see what other people say 
 i understand 
 see 
 the difference could be related to how we have google preferences configured i have it returning N searches per page safe searching off all languages i have no idea whether that would make a difference 
 when i type nakba into google uk i get N curiouser and curiouser 
 wow this is a poweful tool if i should ever request it pleased deny my request i would be find it much too seductive 
 you meet the approval criteria so if you ever request you will probably be approved 
 i agree that xlanguage surnames is not commonly found in any literature about the subject of surnames why then did our encyclopedia move to this system please see 
 indeed thanks for the information id seen much of this debate but not those particular pages 
 thanks for your message i am eager to see your hemingway articles 
 thanks my little project will be starting up in userspace soon and i would like to add for reference that any and all are welcome to jump in 
 i would not suggest dropping adminship i would instead keep on editing positively and reconsider sometime in the future sorry about your rfa 
 thanks i appreciate that i do think i will be best able to serve the community in another capacity even down the road but i do appreciate the idea that im not in some way ruled out 
 you are very welcome for my support and comments at your rfa im pleased to see that the experience hasnt driven you away i know how stressful rfas can be even if they are going well even though you have no plans to run again i hope you may reconsider that at a later date i look forward to seeing future work from you best wishes 
 thanks for this too i will be a wikipedian forever that i know 
 i think you understand now that contrary to your wish those who created this situation are not ever inclined to be the ones to put things right they simply insist on damaging a system then leave others to clean upeven after being asked N N or N times to assist in the reconstruction of a categorization system they insisted on breaking they simply move on to other things if you are able to convince that editor to use his bot powers to repopulate those categories i will be very pleasantly surprised 
 hope springs eternal in the human breast 
 thanks it seems to have gone away for the moment but i certainly want to speak up when it comes back 
 the arbitration committee has asked that voters do not make comments next to their votes if you like you can place your comments in the comments and questions section or simply remove them all togehter cheers 
 i didnt leave any comments next to my vote i am well aware of the rules and as such i set up a vote reasoning page to link to next to my votes out of courtesy to the candidates for i dont like supporting or opposing for no reason at all and dislike putting down just a signature as the voting page isnt really a comment i dont see how it violates the rules but nevertheless i have shortened it 
 i guess my idea was not okay either and i had to move my comments to another section see cheers 
 meh you are right so much for that i see an arbitrator removed my link and didnt even bother to move it or inform me i will readd it to the appropriate section thanks tiptoety 
 what language would the name come from otherwise a isnt indicative to me there is a source calling it hebrew in origin and i suspect there will other examples as well the fact that harrisons definition of the united kingdom is too expansive for our current usage means that whatever he calls an united kingdom surname is inappropriate but that doesnt seem to have an impact on his theories as to the names in the book yes there are some irish names in there that we today wouldnt include but im not using it for is this name a uk name or not im using this for is this name from hebrew celtic gaelic whatever as to not using a single source i will agree to that but right now N per cent of the articles have zero sources so i will take have a N source over nothing im just concerned about wanting to move the articles from 
 rereading the macnicol problem ok thats a bit more complicated we have scottish scottish gaelic and harrisons german and celtic theories 
 cheers and welcome back (i have updated 
 ps whilst i was writing this i noticed on 
 thanks sorry for my absence over the past several monthslife has been quite hectic here though i likely wont be able to contribute nearly the time i used to i am going to attempt to be as active as my time permits i am definitely still interested in clerkng at rfcuin fact i was just about to hobble over there to see if anything needed doingalthough i do caution that i may not be capable of being completely active on either as i said i will do what my time permits as for the mediawiki change sounds like a great implementation wish theyd gotten around to it sooner and sorry i didnt know about it its amazing how quickly things change around here while i get back into the swing of things please feel free to remove any incorrect comments i make and let me know where im mistaken thanks again for your warm welcome back 
 no problems about the inactivity any help you can give is better than none at all and im sure everyone appreciates how hectic life can be thanks for everything and everything you can do by the way if you are on irc our irc channel #wikipediacheckuserclerks is very active and theres some cool irc bots which make our life so much easier just or msg danielbryant if you do use irc so i can set you +i cheers 
 thanks 
 ok im not sure that im always willing to start searching for where things have gone since it isnt usually easy but i agree that putting is a good idea and i will try to make a habit of doing that the funny thing was my attention was focussed on the phrase seven different gases which i replaced with several different gases but only after spending some time on trying to find out who had put those words there in the first place it turns out that he seems to have left wp so i wasnt really being as lazy as you might suppose 
 whoopsie i wasnt aware of the distinction between and i will keep that in mind in the future 
 not a problem tis honestly not even a distinction i was aware of until a couple weeks ago it truly doesnt make all that much of a differencethe only problem is that few realize articles tagged with are actually protected which means they often dont get unprotected for far too long 
 dear stgthanks v much for the article on watson forbes i was hoping someone might have a go at this and you have made a nice job of it the stratton and aeolian articles were crying out for this link with best wishes 
 my pleasure now i need to go and practise my viola 
 thanks for redirecting this i was unaware that there was a longer list elsewhere everything seems to be working fine now 
 ascertain whether there is support for a twophase poll at the eventual rfc where cda will finally be put to the community 
 haunted angel you are really getting to rude mind your manners please 
 no personal attack was made i just threw a bit of sarcasm onto the scene which i do with everything if someone is willing to throw personal attacks at me then i dont think anyone has the right to scold me for being sarcastic to them back get over yourself 
 this is from a while ago but your response took my quote way out of context you said the statement personally i dont like spas is a gross violation of good faith when clearly if you read the response fully the statement refers to disliking spa tags not disliking spas i certainly mispoke myself and edited my comment to reflect this thank you for correcting me 
 ok on that understanding im very happy to apologise 
 i would advise you be very very careful with the semiopen source format you are using now as i am sure you are aware in this format there is no way for the average user to tell exactly what they are running and the volunteers may not check each others additions since this program has access to a large number of passwords the possibility of an addition that would compromise a lot of accounts is very real are you going to check the full code changes made by these volunteers before you release any new versions also the approval list is pretty full is there another mod who could do this beta and i have been solo for some time now wizardry and froth really helped but they are both gone now 
 yes im going to be very cautious in this endeavor and i will check all submissions before letting them go live no individual user will be permitted to let a version go live unless i give him or her that permission you too are invited to help oversee this processshould you wish i will gladly give you access to the project site and id also ask if you have the time to keep an eye on the vp page and make sure no one but i puts up any download links i would however add that created a bogus app to thieve passwords that has the resemblance of vp even without the source would not be difficult to do as such i do not see this as creating any more real risk believe me as well that the volunteers im giving access are being havery carefully reviewedat present time its just eagle 
 awb operates very successfully under the same idea wikipedia operates under that if you give access freely the many who make positive contributions can easily outweigh those who make negative ones it is more risky but has the potential of great benifits as awb has become with limited access the code is safer but the growth potential is reduced the system you are using is a hybrid with the a slightly higher potential of abuse if not monitored with a good chance of growth as long as it is monitored it should be quite effective i would be happy to oversee the project as well as watch the pages here something i already am doing 
 i think i do want access to the source just to oversee changes i would certainly not make any changes since the only thing i am anywhere close to an expert in is mediawiki i also fail criteria N since i detest irc and cant have anything to with vpN because of that d so based on my complete lack of knowledge if you are still willing to let me have access please create an account with my wiki username and whatever password you want then just 
 oh N year old ethiopian spirit guide
 indeed but usually i dont tell him the truth 
 just in case you werent already aware 
 thanks have responded 
 hi there just wondering whether i have offended you in some way four edits i have made recently were reverted by yourself all of these were well cited either you have some issue with me or you dont like hugh allison who was in some way mentioned in all the edits you reverted if the issue is with myself id like to offer you a peace pipe and ask what i have done so i can beg forgiveness if i am making a simple mistake please show me the way etc etc etc 
 thanks for your response have also replied to that on my talk page 
 thanks again for your responses have again replied 
 could you review 
 all those concerns done 
 thanks a lot for the new release and bug fixes the welcome to vpN page says that if you accidentally downloaded N to go back and snag N but on i can only find N to download sorry if i am missing something but am i looking in the right place for N thanks again 
 that is the place to look either what is on the site is N but marked as N or the files havent been uploaded yet if the version marked vp N is working for you use it until a version N is uploaded 
 gah i updated the link but forgot that it puts modification requests to the downloads page in a sort of temporary queue and i have to go through and approve changes before they become current should be N nownote however that i believe N may be coming up quite shortly 
 thanks for the response dont worry about N perfection sometimes takes a little time 
 i could not think of anything more like and oopa than the ica stones why the revertion

 sorry about that revert i saw the missing text on my watchlist and assumed the worst that said i dont think theres enough detail to warrant to separate articles on fu hao however if you do insist on having two separate articles i would recommend a paragraph summary about the tomb on the fu hao article with a for the full article see 
 after sleeping on it i think you are right because the tomb of fu hao is such an important archaeological find i have got a stack of sandai period scholarly texts that i will dig through and see what more information i can find

 happy editing by 
 @amidaniel 
 i hope you will take these into account in the future many thanks 
 i note on further investigation that this issue appears to be more complex than i first realised you appear to have undertaken a rationalisation of some muslim given name pages a task that certainly needed doing nevertheless my concerns remain there need to be separate given name and disambiguation pages per consensus as described in 
 ##nobody or virtually nobody is in fact just called abdul halim typically someone of this name has several additional names either in a form described in 
 name pages and disambiguation pages do serve distinct functions and need to be kept distinct per 
 im grateful that you prompted me to reread 
 sorry to resurrect this issue after a very long while however the example of rice perfectly illustrates my point the current 
 hey it looks great thanks im not going to declare it the official wikimonitor logo but its certainly a hell of a lot better than anything i have come up with > 
 i have modified the categories to make clear that its a name page it also serves a disambiguation purpose as many name pages do the name can perfectly well be its own primary topic that helps to prevent the arbitrary grabbing of common arabic names as primary topic names for articles about fairly obscure people as has often happened 
 if you want to experiment i suggest you use 
 samuel after moving a page you may replace the remaining redirect with an article or disambig page this would prevent fixing redirects to the new target if you would keep that redirect without fixing its redirects just write _staticredirect_ to its content i have changed the behavior of redirect bots especially for this request to keep redirects pointing to a static redirect unchanged this gives you enough time to check every link if you are ready you should remove this magic word i guess this is in your sense and the best solution for your work regards 
 i am sorry this magic word is __staticredirect__ 
 in 
 i have shifted this discussion to 
 i have continued this discussion over there 
 greetings samueltheghost i happened to notice your appropriate policing of nishidani in re the saq page speaking as another editor who may have a difference of opinion with you regarding the merits of the traditional view but appreciates your commitment to fairness i just wanted to say thanks nishidanis behavior on this page is that of a fanatical ideologue he does great damage to the page i hope you will join in the discussion about the proposal to nominate the page in its current form as a wikipedia model page if you have not already done so imho the page is nowhere near being a model of npov thanks 
 for 
 obviously in order to translate it i need the source code p 
 its sounds like you want to create a name page for the arabic names you dont need to create a dab page if it becomes apparent one is necessary it can be created but if you are going to start with all the articles about people that contain the name and include a paragraph about the name it sounds like you are completely within the name article space why worry about a dab page why not just do name pages john ( 
 thanks for you message id be very happy to create just name pages unfortunately there are constraints over there too specifically where a name also happens to be name of a place for example i have put it in under see also ot other etc then name page specialists have objected to that logically they have a point all i want to do is to have sensible pages contining sensible useful and wellsourced collections of material but i keep being told that the categorisations that have been set up are allowing no place for them it gets a bit frustrating as id rather work within the rules and be cooperative but if the rules are to be interpreted too rigidly i have no option but to ignore them im absolutely loyal to wikipedias basic principles such as wpnpov and wprs but some of the guidelines are too dogmatic and i think a bit out of touch with reality 
 i just clicked on a link to the vandalproof page and noticed your name there i have never heard of the programme before and was wondering if i could ask you a couple of questions about it N can anyone use it N it sounds exactly like the tools sysops use are they N if so do you have to be screened or elected to be able to use the tools or do you have to already be a sysop N if vandalproof is like being an admin why doesnt everyone just download the vandalproof file rather than go to rfa any other info would be helpful thanks 
 oneyes but you must be approved N nope sysops tools are built into 
 no it does not work with 
 how can i request to become a vprf moderator and nbsp
 on a related note would it be ok to let froth back assuming i actually explain what to do this time i will monitor him 
 what is recdec and nbsp
 to be honest we are currently debating doing away with the moderation system altogether however until that time im really quite unconcerned with who has access and who does not prodego feel free to add or remove whoever you feel necessary from the list and if theres any controversy about any of your decisions let people know to contact me 
 re is at 
 thanks 
 please see comments 
 ok i have tried it we will see what happens 
 your first reference above is the only one that is really explicit so i have put it into the article all the other cases you cite may be uses of the muslim name of arabic origin though even if they are the slavonic meaning might be providing psychological support for them i hope you are happy with the article as it is now 
 samuel thanx for the good faith assistnace article is fine as far as i am concernedregards 
 why did you delete my notification the whole paragraph contributed by you to the article with an exception of a slight change in the first paragraph is a copy of the text on the thus i dont really understand what you mean by sense of proportion failure as 
 i admit i was lazy in not paraphrasing from my sole source i have just been looking a 
 as an editor previously involved in the shakespeare authorship question mediation you should note that there is a related request for arbitration at which you may wish to participate 
 if you have any questions about the permission dont hesitate to ask otherwise happy editing 
 i have to inform you that wwwamidanielcom is currently unavailable both the forum the website and vps download link happy editing 
 i have uploaded my version which has custom bottons useful only for me and my stats but i havent managed to remove em to as temporary version for who needs to download it im putting a link in the talk page 
 see http or or amidanielcom or im aware and i will hopefully have it fixed soon 
 read i want to express my opinions regard it i suggest that you consider installing a different cms like drupal joomla or mkportal the last two can be connected with smf joomla with a bridge mkportals integration with smf is build in the cms its designed to handle smf or phpbb or ipb or vbulletin also i have registered to the bug tracker and i suggest that you add vpN as product btw are there any news regarding wikimonitor 
 yeah postnuke is shit but i really cant stand joomla or mambo or really any other cms that i have seen im really thinking about just doing a mediawiki as the start page unless i can find something better the only problem with that route is that people then have to register for bugs smf mailing lists _and_ the wiki which is sort of a pain in the ass is vpN not added as a product i thought i had perhaps i forgot to set it public feel free to post bugs although it may be some time before the devs get on board re wikimonitor nothing at the moment im absolutely swamped and am not sure when i will get around to it as stated on 
 i personally dislike cmss in general i use a basic html page or a cms system of my own design when i am doing things like that the other one was though horrible there were N errors left right center and everywhere else it was hard to understand and even harder to navigate shudder 
 i generally do too but i at first sort of liked postnuke because it was so simplebefore long it just became a mess i dunno i will make up my mind soon for now the plain little notice will have to do 
 after your allegation that indeed was pov i browsed the mos but the closest i could come was wpoped which does not quite cover the sentiment i used the word to keep the flow of the text going which means i used it as a rhetorical device but i dont see how it could insinuate pov please enlighten me 
 i have copied this to the article talk page and replied there 
 please be more cautious in labelling edits as vandalism this for example certainly wasnt it was an edit by a banned user and could have been reverted for that reason instead had you wished 
 yes im sorry you are right 
 if you find yourself in an editing dispute use the articles 
 as the text above says use the articles talk page to discuss controversial changes there has developed quite a long discussion on the talk page in which you yourself have taken no part but have seen fit to come in and revert me your advice as to my standards of behaviour would be more convincing if yours were higher 
 i do indeed have a backup copy of vp N as well as a copy of all of them since N which was uploaded accidentally so that will be fine i signed up for the mailing list and bugs so yeh 
 great well let me see if i can dig them up off my old ftp but in not i will need you to email me the N source 
 i have made a number of complaints on the fads and fallacies talkpage to which you have not responded viz and please respond 
 if you mean general responses to what you have said theres my reply to which you never responded except for the npa issue that we have since dealt with if theres anything else that you regard as a complaint please say so but i can assure you that i dont wish to be unpleasant or unfair there are a couple of editors in this discussion who i really dislike but you are not one of them 
 oh lets leave it its just that i get so frustrated in trying to move this discussion forward it keeps splintering and there are loose ends dangling everywhere 
 i got a qustion how come 
 because i havent gotten around to approving users yet 
 ohhh ( im sorry you got stuck with all the grunt work beta i wish i could help out but im just swamped at the moment 
 please dont feel rushed just giving a heads up on the approval page 
 samuel i reported that i had asked for a review of the article and i accordingly asked for editors to hold off with editing for the time being please respect protocol 
 there is no such protocol after your unilateral request for review i held off for five days just in case there was some response not surprisingly there has been none life goes on 
 and so i learn something new again they appear to have there own priorities or maybe there is no they i dont know but why so cynical apart from placing the request as i did how else can we get the article assessed 
 thanks 
 ok i could live with that i have just checked the 
 fine then i will do it 
 i have a fully revised version of N complete with fixes and changes such as the aiv issues we discussed and a few other things that managed to move themselves into that version by accident unto where shall i send it 
 if you could please email the src and a compiled binary to dccannon _at_ cs unm edu it would be much appreciated unfortunately i have no compiler on hand at the moment as my other laptop is nowherez to be found on another note i will have phpcollab up soon and hopefully a webbased interface for my subversion repository the shell version is already up so if you want to just ssh into it to upload i can gladly give you a login the webbased version should be a hell of a lot easier to use though 
 actually on second thought now that phpcollabs back up why dont you just toss it there 
 i have uploaded it there but not a compiled version shall i upload that as well then also as phpcollab wont let me create tasks i have created a discussion with the changes etc just to let you know 
 if you could that would be great i left a note on phpcollab to this effect as well looked over the code and it all looks fine to me 
 you undid my contribution to the article 
 thank you for taking the time to explain 
 i see that you reverted my edit to this page the page appeared on of disambiguation pages that had incorrectly formed links to other disambiguation pages since it was a dab page i did a dab cleanup removing things that dont belong on a dab page such as the narrative at the top and the reference section if you want that content to remain then the page should not be a dab page please decide which way you want it and either reinstate my changes or remove the hndis tag thanks 
 i have removed the hndis tag 
 thanks 
 the answer to your question is given in 
 please take some time to familiarize yourself with the 
 thanks for picking up on the holes in the article cleareyed thinkers are needed to improve all articles but on a personal note can you be a member of wp dc and wp marvel im sure the rules of the universe require you to choose one or the other what next wp dark horse 
 oh and you are welcome i dont remember how i stumbled on to the page but i saw the small space rhondda took up on the map and wondered how big is that now i know 
 you might want to familiarize yourself with wikipedias policies 
 yes what you are asking me to do is a very simple task however performing that task does not resolve the blatant gfdl violations of these articles if this forking was suggested by another administrator please have him contact me before im going to begin unprotecting articles and screwing with redirects however i need for the gfdl attribution concerns to be addressed which frankly is not very simple 
 hi a disagreement has arisen over which of two photos would be better as the main infobox image for the 
 done but of course you know that 
 hi lejman i tried to make the 
 the page could better explain what players actually do on the game the main things players do are run socialize pkill quest roleplay explore areas and level up characters im not sure how extensive the page should be though 
 thanks the description probably shouldnt be too extensive but it probably helps to clarify how a mud works beyond just providing a link to the article i think we have improved it to that end 
 hey i reviewed the gac for 
 good work 
 thank you uN 
 perhaps most importantly did you and whomever come to some kind of consensus and plan on the tables titles font colors some are dark others are white im about to save my pending fix in season N where i also converted that to white and then realized how inconsistent the standard in place is so whats the deal on that or or 
 or 
 welcome to the project 
 thank you 
 hey ad i have got my username changed and would appreciate an update of the various vandalproof places as i assume i will have lost my mod powers thanks and mdash 
 everything done but the smf account 
 smf name is now changed account details should have been emailed to you xyr erm sean 
 since it is a private wiki why dont you install a feature similar to wikitruths which disables account creation and editing by anonymous ips no hard feelings about the adinfinitum block i just didnt know that it was a private wiki and nbsp~ 
 actually i can guess based on a conversation i had with amidaniel it is easier to let users create accounts that cant do anything and change their rights to make them join rather then creating an account for anyone who needs to join via email so really he didnt need to block you i suppose unless he abandoned the idea of restricting editing because of an error message and you could edit ignore that last sentence steptrip it is mainly to cover me if i am wrong 
 no editings still disabled but blocking just gave me an extra sense of security account creation is now disabled so hopefully i wont have any more problems sorry about the confusion though i may put up a sandbox wiki sometime in the near future which you will be welcome to have at 
 thanks so much i will follow both your suggestions 
 awaiting a reply please id rather go down the pipex than trufina route partly because of the limitation noted about the latters american provenance 
 apologies i was not online when you posted this please have pipex contact me at dccannon _at_ cs _dot_ unm _dot_ edu and please also send me an email from your pipex account again im not going to guarantee that the account will be usurped but with proof of your identity i will gladly address it to the devs 
 or hi im the wikipedian in residence at the smithsonian 
 would you like to help improve wikipedias coverage of topics related to the national archives and its incredible collection this summer the national archivesuN which houses some of americas most important historical documentsuN is hosting me as its wikipedian in residence and i have created 
 thanks i have only just found my way back to you jo mabel was also helping and suggested i went to metadeveloper which i did via his page but hes closed down and i now cant find my way back these N hr wiki days where change occurs all the time are so difficult for newbies to work with i do want to get back however as myself and will eventually do so the next step will be to follow this up so i do hope you can leve it here for a while since i have to figure out all the dots and dashes and that wont be today jeffrey newman 
 apparently you were indefinatly blocked i would recommend making a new account since you dont have any edits under the old one 
 your username was blocked by me N months ago for its similarity to the username 
 using the reason parameter nothing transcludes the one you created and nothing links to it would you mind if the one you created were redirected to the other one or deleted 
 sorry that was created before the new pp templates now deleted 
 thanks for the good wishes but how is an end to the holiday season ever a good thing ] 
 doh back to the selfrewarding altruism of contributing to wikipedia of course 
 nmap will tell you that a given host has one or more httprelated open ports after that how do you confirm that the host is actually an open proxy the straightforward way would be to send an actual request to each open port to retrieve a page from google or wikipedia is there a better way 
 in most cases actually sending a request to the proxy is really not necessary if you can identify services like squids or unfiltered http proxies thats usually more than enough evidence to block it in many cases simply resolving the host will tell you everything you need to know if you really feel that you need to connect to it to be sure then probably wgetting google through it is the best way i unfortunately do not know of any better way to conclusively check proxies and while a successful page request through the proxy pretty much proves that it is open failing to get a successful page request in no way proves that it is not sorrry i cant help more 
 happen to have any production information for 
 thanks for the expansion anything else because the prose is now at N kb and id like to bring it up to N kb if possible also which if any of the cultural references should be kept 
 just in case you arent aware a policy was recently implemented by the wikimedia foundation regarding access to nonpublic data please note if you do not comply with these rules you should remove yourself from 
 i am contacting you about vandalproof when i press the button that automatically places on their usertalk produces welcome welcome or two headers please email me or respond on my talk page thanks 
 mr (daniel is the first name he isnt 
 yes see the last entry at 
 oh my gosh ( im so sorry do you think you can answer my question please im still sorry 
 see my message until then you can edit custombuttonstxt and make the the change locally 
 oops thanks i was wondering how to do that 
 no problem although its always easier just to get an account if you want to frequently edit wikipedia 
 hi deiz i try my best not to ever disrupt articles only improve them and feel that for N per cent of the time i havent disrupted i accept your decision since you are a wikipedia official 
 fair enough the talk page edit noted above was certainly not constructive of course not all editors are shakespeare stephen hawking or mother theresa but in future before you press save ask yourself is this edit truly going to improve the encyclopedia 
 gosh what happened there 
 compromised admin account its been sorted out 
 thanks it was just sheer luck that i happened to notice who really deserves a barnstar is mark_ryan who logged into the account and changed the password at the speed of light 
 granted that not all can use it could administrators etc be forced there for password and email changes to commit temporary mayhem not set himself up for more in the future security is a pain if we could only get rid of the users wed have a prayer 
 whats presently being discussed is a mechanism to allow session data to be transferred from the secure to the http server and then requiring all users to login from that server still no word yet on if or when this is going to happen though and its relatively low on the priority list see 
 thanks i will wander over there and see if i can contribute 
 mmmmph not really a bugzilla user and not sure how to proceed i will toss what i was going to leave there here and if you think it worthwhile please forward it to the appropriate list how about requiring after the user attempts to change their password email address or both that they then log into the https server and complete the change request if they succeed in the https login if they dont succeed in the login then the change shouldnt be allowed and the attempt recorded at least in the users talk page so that they know an attempt was made i will guess that this should create only a small increase in traffic in the https server but could prevent the damage propagations we saw today the wait for the login slows down automatic attempts and as well a keyboard left open cant then create password or email damage thanks 
 well i didnt think it was right to ask these questions on the project discussion page so im asking them here you sound like you do scans and that sort of stuff for a living i was wondering if you could teach me how to do what you are doing i would appreciate it greatly 
 lol no not for a living but it is knowledge that you generally tend to acquire if you work or study in the field of computer science and networking i would however be glad to bring you by on the basics of it and we could definitely use some more volunteers to help with scans do you have any knowledge or experience in computer networking if not you might read through some of the materials at 
 do you by any chance attend 
 nope sorry 
 no worries mate 
 i was actually getting rid of vandalism 
 do you see anything in 
 ok 
 i thought it was pretty funny and probably true ^_^ 
 it wasnt supposed to be a big deal really sometimes i just write stupid things in the summary thing the important thing for me was getting rid of the vandalism 
 you reverted three bot edits to ohio county talk pages including 
 the bot was not simply removing the templates from the talk pages but rather moving them from the talk page to the article if a page does not need an infoboxneeded template on its talk page please remove it these reverts were done blindly and en masse so please feel free to use your judgment and undo any reversions you feel were incorrect 
 why should 
 i dont really support its deletion it was deleted by cyde after a bot went mad with it and i reversed his deletion thinking it better that there be some discussion on the matter i took it to tfd see the 
 just a note of thanks i worry that despite the best intentions we end up alltoowilling to pull the trigger and delete what could be improved or should be discussed in the interest of consensus 
 hey i have done my best with the ga review here 
 done a bit more to it there were plenty of sources once i started looking properly cheers 
 i just felt that you were adding a criticism section only because it was a christian theory i mean i really dont care what secular humanists think about christian apocolyptic theories i originally wrote the first paragraph so i felt like international demonic order sounded better and more accurate then theocratic whatever i did however like the emperial cult thing 
 im trying to add criticism to all theories as quickly as i find them the criticism of the christian end time theory mostly comes from 
 nice to be back 
 we will see if i find some time to fix and get the bot hosted unfortunately my time has been occupied with rl and 
 i disagree football is fooball not soccer 
 N please assume good faith as people have done with you portillo and N i have asked that the discussion be continued 
 please read the instructions you must aregister for use first ~~
 it seems most definitely clear to me that the software is by no means notable would anyone other than those who have visited this page or its website have ever heard of it can you find 
 i dont see why discussing copyrighted software would somehow require some sort of release any more than it would if it were in mainspace image is a problem but i dont see why we need the image at all 
 that 
 classic tN this user wants you to know they hate you and everything you stand for seems to be somewhat more than a joke its a very provocative statememt clearly intended to increase bad feeling about wikipedia policy i appreciate that you didnt put it there yourself but now you have restored it so its your responsibility 
 im sorry i meant no harm please understand i wasnt trying to mock policy only userboxes that so obviously fall into the category
 could you please give me a more exact reason for denying my application the application page itself states that in most circumstances users with fewer than N mainspace edits will generally not be accepted i do realize the concise meaning of that however it lets on to the possibility that one could be accepted without N mainspace edits while im attempting to contest your decision i would like to emphasize to you that all of my edits and participation in wikipedia have been benign and that im attempting to slowly work myself up the ranks to become more helpful in the community obviously if denied most tools that aid me i will never be able to do so if you still believe my denial is warranted could you at least point me in the direction of some ways to fight more vandalism besides what im doing now additionally i advise that you change your vp application page to more accurately reflect your acceptance process as per the reason you left me on my talk page 
 use 
 also id like to point out that you can vandal fight just fine without any tools for example i have never used any a shiny program just makes it easier to screw up having a solid knowledge of the policies themselves is much better than an automated tool 
 why did you erase my vp status i was using it correctly respond on my talk plz 
 b i as noted in my header post my messages here and here only please note that if i respond to your message it will always be placed here it may be duplicated on your talk page depending on the urgency and importance i do not consider your message to be of paramount importance or urgency 
 yes i was the first to edit the page and break news of michael jacksons incident i added these edits once i saw a news ticker to describe that he had suffered cardiac arrest and then was rushed to the hospital and then another to add the current event tag at the top of the page 
 congratulations friend 
 we have discussed this in depth before 
 sorry i missed it 
 you demonstrated between the block and the above that you a are inexperienced with wikipedia b have poor decisionmaking and c are erratic put together and after consulting with a number of moderators and conferring to the confidential complaint about you i decided that to protect the project and the reputation of vandalproof i should remove your access to the powerful tool this is done using the authority given to me by daniel cannon owner and operator of the application and with the support of a number of moderators 
 i knew what personal attack templates were i was wondering the codes i know how to edit a rfa i was wondering if you could without a comment i know for example but didnt know how to say csdN as an example i also believe you should have told me that you did this personally i think it was very rude of you guys also all my vp edita are relievent but if you dont want me to i wont help revert vandals faster 
 looks like i got this one right 
 i saw your suggestions in the talk page of the article and in ians talk page i like your idea very much would you be fine with the following version mjj dubbed the king of pop was an american musician and entertainer widely regarded as one of the most commercially successful recording artists of all time as for citations they are given in the last section legacy and influence where he is cited as the greatest selling male solo act ever we dont have to clutter the lead with citations so i think that should be good enough let me know what you think thank you 
 yeah im sure i can live with that the other option is to simply leave it as it is michael joseph jackson dubbed the king of pop was an american recording artist and entertainer 
 thanks i didnt know where to get those templates from or how to use them 
 check out this of cphp i cant test it on my own so there are probably a few missing commas and things but once the typos are fixed it should be a huge improvement i will work on the geshicss colors for it tomorrow 
 hello you apparently linked guttural screaming to the 
 please find a reliable source thanks 
 you have mail ~ 
 got it and responded 
 daniel it is a matter of utmost importance that i must speak to you privately regarding your actions here i am beginning to feel intimidated to the point of blocking anthony for stalking me in much the same fashion as was brought up in his first failed rfa with essjay i ask that you remove agk from the moderators list until i can talk to you 
 might i also have a few minutes to speak with you ~ 
 can you help me geting family guy to a ga or fa 
 thanks for asking but im no good at getting articles to ga or fa 
 so how exactly do you plan to expand the article i believe that the article is about pet chickens such as in an urban environment not a farm or hatchery i understand there may be a few howto sentences but theres really nothing wrong with writing what pet chickens eat or the fact that chickens need to have dust baths in order to keep parasites in check 
 my point is that all chickens take dust baths and have the same dietary requirements the content i removed is byandlarge not unique to keeping pet chickens 
 hi amidaniel you changed my block on this ip from N hours to indefinite it was used for two and a half minutes and is extremely likely to be dynamic please reconsider changing this block to a reasonable length thanks 
 according to the documentation provided by the isp all of their internet packages provide static ip allocationas such i think it is actually quite unlikely that this ip is dynamic if you can find it to be otherwise i will gladly reverse the block however in cases of death threats i feel it absolutely imperative that the user making them be denied access to edit indefinitely we have lost many good contributors as a result of death threats and i dont see any reason to take them lightly if you disagree please by all means take it to 
 i dont disagree with the seriousness its the effectiveness its also likely its not the only ip available to the editor so it should probably be hard blocked instead if they are to be prevented from editing from it i would tender a period of years when you set the hard block 
 member is removing copyvio notices from the 
 well its not mentioned anywhere else so maybe it should be mentioned here plus pet chickens are kept differently to hatcheries hatcheries have cages with only a tiny bit of food and water for each chicken no grass no dustbaths etc 
 general chicken information should go in the main chicken article also your comment about hatcheries is totally incorrect not all farms and hatcheries are the same and some are better or worse than others 
 hey mj would you be interested in collaborating with me on an april fools double dyk nom im looking to add two ship articles one from the wwi era and one from the wwii era i thought if you were interested you could write the wwiiera article let me know if you are interested and i can fill in the details thanks uN 
 if you could write an article for the ellerman lines ship i will write about their former i was thinking about a hook like this uN that the 
 well id seen that there was an older one but miramar showed it as leyland line how about either uN that the 
 i know that you are the creator of vp and know everything about vp however how many people needs to be in the approval list before they get approved and when will they get approved i am waiting for myn but it takes too long is anything wrong 
 please be patient you will be approved eventualy 
 please note it is nothing personal by any means and we certainly welcome you to apply again soon thank again for your interest in vandalproof 
 hi daniel actually i was blocked over a year ago i think you misread the date the block itself was contested by two other admins at the time as being inappropriate nonetheless i have been involved in some heated discussion at 
 no problem thanks for that glad to be on board and #N 
 i didnt write anything i reverted 
 whats this then 
 i reverted that 
 let me get this clear you are saying you didnt write to momento prem rawat said in the early N s etc you just inserted someone elses crap 
 congrats 
 thankyou very much mate ^_^ uN 
 you are very welcome keep up the good work 
 heres what happened i noticed that you were banned from editing an article so i checked your userpage i wanted to revert it back to this is momentos page but i accidently reverted that paragraph which i dont know what it meant or what it was about 
 the truth at last ok according to the conditions of my ban we can have no further discussion about why i was banned and the circumstances around it hows the weather 
 flagged revisions has been losing popularity what has been happening on the developer side thanks (
 development is still most definitely continuing and so far as im aware we are still planning on installing it on wikipediawhen exactly this is going to happen im not sure in any case the extension is rapidly approaching stability and i personally believe it satisfactory for deployment in its current state if i had to give an eta i would guess around one to two months but i cannot say that for sure 
 hi portillo i see that you have an administrator willing to make difficult blocks userbox however i can find 
 thanks for removing it 
 could you take a look at 
 i will go have a look uN 
 agreed uN 
 thanks 
 no problem uN 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised removing will stop the 
 afd 
 hi last approval in N july where are you 
 done by the way 
 and ndash 
 well for starters it would appear that you are running this off a windows box rather than a unix box as such convert isnt going to be located at or usr or bin or convert you need to set $wgimagemagickconvertcommand to wherever imagemagick is installed on windows i believe this is cprogram filesimagemagickconvertexe but please check first 
 i cannot use vandal proof because every time i click on something ie pops up an error its a different error every time and its making me nuts how can i get vp to run without all the errors N N august N 
 try 
 not sure about sources but i consider groove metal to be 
 its original research to say that these two terms are the same thing and neither of these term are really notable if you think the topics notable then please provide some reliable sources to prove me wrong 
 i dont really care if the article is deleted or not i already voted for a keep my only concern is what will groove metal bands be classified as 
 how many bands can you actually find reliably sourced with the term 
 i was asking if you could give me access to proxy scanner mainly to verify proxies on eswiki currently i suspect we have detected a few proxies but have no way to verify it reach me a t 
 did this get done drini 
 did checing the ip or did getting the password in the N st case yes in the N nd not please use specialemailuser to bypass my spam filter

 the use of images containing foundation logos while they are indeed copyrighted is permissible in userspace even while other nonfree images are not it would indeed be quite absurd to suppose that a websites use of its own logo could violate its copyright on that logo each of the many many times this issue has been raised the consensus of the board and of wikipedia has been that use of wmfcopyrighted logos in userspace is appropriate additionally screenshots of a tool for wikimedia be the tool released under a free license or not for the purpose of illustrating the software in question on its appropriate project page or discussion page are permissible on those pages by simple common sense while the screenshots were mistagged i should think it a far better use of your time to retag them or contact me to ask for an explanation of copyright than to go spam me with three redundant templates and mark the images for deletion tagging is a job for a bot not a person 
 aside from the wikipedia logo issue which i am not pressing screenshots of nonfree software are typically nonfree i looked at

 can you check this ip for an open proxy a similar ip near me N was found to be an open proxy and N runs the same filtering software as that ip thanks 
 i listed it on 
 also id like to become a verified user of the wikiproject would you be able to make me one thanks 
 no open proxies i can find it is running an http proxy on N and a squid on N but both ports are filtered and the connection is refused when i attempt to connect to them N is however running an open proxy server on N and while im able to connect to it its incredibly incredibly slow as for becoming a verified proxy checker you are going to need to demonstrate your ability to thoroughly check hosts for open proxieswhich requires doing a lot more than simply analyzing an nmap result or checking sorbs lists do you have any experience in it or with network security 
 i have a lot of experience with using open proxies in order to get around the school web filters i have also studied up on squid and httpget proxies 
 any updates

 thank you for contributing to wikipedia luigibob however your edit was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove 
 what the 
 also doesnt editbotsports break a wikipedia rule about having a name designed to confuse its not a bot it was created and made one edit i dont have the ability to trace ip addresses of users was this done and was there any similarity found 
 they worked around the same time as far as i can see there was only one revert personally editbot should be blocked per the username violation but i warned them for now they only edited once and bots usually have many edits by day one their one edit summary is concerning though a checkuser wasnt run because there was nothing indicative of a sockpuppet the dead giveaways usually include similar edit summaries working against an editor and other odd behavior if anything does start popping up that is suspicious let me know and i will look into it 
 thanks for the quick response please check 
 if its a positive response i dont want

 hi fvas i was wondering if you might be willing to draw a structure for the sesquiterpene panal to be placed in the article 
 absolutely will do just give me a day or so to catch up on things a source would be nice 
 theres a structure shown here in for documentation it can be sourced to nakamura h kishi y shimomura o panal uN a possible precursor of fungal luciferin tetrahedron N N uN thanks 
 hmm i cant access that page do you have another source 
 never mind got it is the stereochemistry known 
 and once again i will whip something up asap 
 a reference is used to back up something that might be disputed nobody is going to contest the bare facts about a movie so it is not necessary also i have not seen imdb used as a reference in any of the hundreds of film articles i have edited 
 i suggest you check the faclass film articles eg 
 there is no need to refer to policy about this it is something that is practiced in most of the thousands of film articles that have gone past the substub stage it has been established that each film article has a section external links where imdb img official website and possibly other acceptable sources are mentioned once these are present we dont reference them for simple film data what we need to reference is claims about the content of the film and this by referring to professional critics or the official website rather than contributor based imdb and amg comments etc i hope this helps 
 in the future i would recommend presenting the idea of a potential contribution on the talk page of a wellmonitored article before starting the miniproject cheers uN 
 the funny thing is that some of these reverting guys arent even enrolled in the running collaboration being bold can be interpreted in a variety of ways mostly according to ones character when i see such behaviour i always pick a more pleasant topic to work on or one note about your last message admins as such dont have any particular role in content decisions or what should come in the instructions of the infobox thats us ordinary wikipedians who through discussing and organizing we get some guidelines laid out which in their turn last only until a decision to modify them gathers consensus admins are simply entrusted some special tools like permanently deleting or protecting pages which can happen only according to decisions taken by a clear majority i hope you dont lose your good feelings about editing here free has its ups and downs too 
 i see you have been changing footnotes to references is footnotes inappropiate why is it worth the effort to change since both seem appropriate let me know as inquiring minds like mine want to know best and happy new year 
 hi its an appropriate question the mos recommends that the reference section be named as references 
 super cool i edit and watch a whole lot of articles so i will make the changes from footnotes to references on an ongoing basis i too like uniformity im glad plot is the norm as you described i have also moved sections around to conform with mos hey any specifics on film reviews i like critical reception if this is wrong let me know asap finally i hate trivia sections and try to move them into the body or eliminate if inane thanks for your courteous response ps i love the bouncing wikiball i may borrow that for a while ha 
 im glad you mentioned critical reception there are several names for that section and i have mostly just lumped them together under reception for ease but you are right its appropriate to look at critical reception as part of the general reception or release as in 
 one additional thing because plot denotes a work of fiction should not the plot section in 
 o shoot have i been changing documentary films i thought i was keeping an eye out for that im wary of documentary films music videos porn etc but its likely that one or more have slipped by me i have been at home these past few days with a cold just wanting to do something simple like run an awb sweep there are things i could be doing but i just dont have th energy for it i guess my concentration is not what it should be do you know of any documentaries i have changed regards 
 silky you changed 
 i have seen what you have done to cast on 
 hi luigi how are you doing as i know you contribute a lot to articles about foreign cinema so id like to ask you to help me im confused about the following thing when starting a page about a foreign film should i choose its english or original title as a name for the article in my understanding since its the englishlanguage wikipedia the english title is preferred still i often find articles about foreign films where the original titles are used as the default names (for example 
 hey luigi thank you so much for your help much appreciated and yes you are right about le jumeau however in french wiki and some other sources it is listed as le jumeau so i chose to keep this spelling seem that they sometimes capitalize nouns that come right after articles guess i forgot french completely best 
 hi luigibob and thanks for the kind comments re my work you are right about the keaton template it does look too intrusive i have overhauled it using the same template i used for the pathe serials so it now 
 no problem looking forward to seeing some of my stubs expanded 
 i have also done the same rejigging of the charlie chaplin template 
 my fave would have to be harold lloyd i had an opportunity to see 
 hey 
 as per indicated by your first warning you were told to read the 
 for the userpage revert looks like theres a little fella out there with some angermanagement issues 
 lmao i could read what he wrote over and over again it really is quite amusing how frustrated he got purely because you reverted his pathetic vandalism ah some people p uN 
 it isnt enough for you just to declare no on a change that i make some actual rationale would be appreciated in the future no implies you to be the sole arbiter of wikipedia like a proverbial caesar giving a thumbs down i would contend that such behavior does not represent the spirit behind wikipedia is there a specific rule behind your refusal to allow quotes within a quote box 
 as for the same picture i actually replaced the old one with one of a higher resolution and thus better quality apparently cosmetic improvements are not your forte 
 please 
 thank you for your consideration but i have been on the wiki for N yrs 
 wow you have been here four times as long as me and your talk page is empty anyway sorry for not checking but i thought you were a newbie 
 hey its me i trust you are well i just got pushed back by an editor who changed rerences to notes i rev and said as per 
 keep smiling 
 ciao i see that the image question has been resolved i noted on the talk page they were apparently never were protected or requested for protection also added a cite to the cannes film festival the list was also made into a paragraph i will keep it on my watch list for a while but let me know if problems arent being taken to the talk page 
 see my comment i am about to post on the talk page actually positive to negative ratio of reviews should be N to N based off of which has N positive and N negative reviews 
 you too amigo dont eat too many eggs 
 the movie poster for md is now very large and i have no idea why 
 dont stress out on this guys its a meta problem or bug right now that is actively being worked on if you are interested you can check out 
 your revert areasons were justified however you did not revert anything according to those reasons please see talk page if you disagree with editing concerns try to refrain from editing from 
 hello somersetN the reason i made the revert was because you changed my edits by making a fullstop and then inserting other sects the reason why i did this is because most christians believe in the 
 thank you for your insight 
 all right thank you 
 hi there luigibob i just wanted to stop by and drop you a little note i wanted to thank you for your truly invaluable contributions to many wikipedia film articles particularly to 
 you are welcome i think the banned bugs bunny cartoon you own is 
 your plan sounds good i was going to have a go at making a production section first 
 i wont get to doing any substantive with the article until later tonight but looking over the article as it stands i think i will probably want to fold the tagline into the production section which would leave the noir analysis alone in the background section how about folding it into critical reception which could either stand on its own or be folded as a subsection into a responses section which you said you would be working on once we see what the text layout looks like we can probably break up the two photos into separate places in the article i will probably want to dig up my copy of the film and watch it again its been a long time 
 i have fiddled with the bottom image a bit to enhance its quality 
 hi just wondering if you are still planning to expand the plot and develop a response section if so i will hold off on doing anything more to the article just let me know thanks 
 great i look forward to seeing what you add and to hearing your arguments about the other stuffbtw i just saw the narrow margin on tcm what a great little film 
 hi just checking in to see how things are going with updating the hitchhiker hope your political gig isnt snowing you under 
 hey backfeel free to do your thing on the article i have been working on a few documentaries i like wiki because it relaxes me as i edit and bring an article to a decent presentation still working long hours i have not had a chance to see the film nor to bring it out storage best 
 ok thanks theres no rush of course but if i feel the urge i will give in to it instead of holding back but i too need to look at the film again before i do and there always seems to be some damn baseball game to watch 
 thank you for your interest in vandalproof firefoxman you have now been added to the list of authorized users so if you havent already simply 
 thanks 
 what you need to do is click update 
 thank you very much i will get to it now 
 oops good thing i saw this however to truly arevert it you would have had to bypass my earlier revert but its done now no big thing and mdash 
 sorry i do not respond to 
 actually they seem to have a valid point 
 opps i made a mistake and read the wrong side of the edit column sorry 
 i edited the categories in your sandbox subpage per 
 super i learned something new in wiki today 
 no i cannot accept your argument as it amounts to censorship sorry 
 i will keep an eye on the page i put the N nd image as an alternate poster but the one in the infobox is currently legit i also put a warning on beedoxs talk page so there is a history there in case this becomes a pattern and the individual can then be dealt with 
 you should be approved by now thanks 
 im afraid i cant do so at the current time im not familiar with awb policies of approving and not approving bots and nowhere on the page does it say that an admin may add an approved bot to the list at any time i apologize for this its nothing personal but i just dont feel comfortable adding that account to the list without knowing the full policies and requirements of awb bots first i would recommend adding your request to the 
 the request for awb bot should go to 
 i have removed your bots request from 
 im doing well thanks how have you been actually i didnt know that foreign words like noir should be in italics in the english language you certainly hint at my edit in the 
 ok now i got it as of now i will pay attention to that again thanks a lot best regards 
 im not going to bother changing it back because someone else will eventually correct it and mdash preferably someone with a sense of style cheers 
 i understood what you meant re my style its not so much that i agree with the 
 judging from your recent edits you made an assumption that i created that list from scratch and had anything to do with the honorary diplomas listed please check the edit history 
 no problem it can be confusing when theres been hundreds of edits i was just removing people who didnt have their own article yet remember to add people to the comprehensive 
 hi luigibob our 
 as far as the 
 hey plumber guy how are you amigo today i have been editing the las vegas article baby its odd but i have lost count how many core american articles i have had to develop given all the americans on here it is often left to a bald belgianwelshman to sort out how is the film work going 
 ah yes skier is doing great yes i havent had much time for film editing the last few months although i have been develpoing some of the pages like 
 so you know see that american brit is as guilty as the vandals you said you once suspected him but changed your mind when did you almost see the light the first time anyway im sure he has a punishment comming 
 i wouldnt call this exactly seeing the light but i suspected for a while what seemed to convince me that he wasnt the sock master was that he accused himself of being the vandal if he was in apparent the vandal as i said i suspected yet decided against it but i suspected for some of the reasons above just because some of the reasons were there i wasnt going to assume that they were true however such thoughts will eventually lead to paranoia ah well lets call it the end of it i was deceived as were others but that will be called the end of it and punishments will be given to the appropriate uN 
 hi you may want to review 
 thanks to be honest its too much effort to remember as long as the cats are there the aesthetics can come later 
 here it is my wikifriends a recipe for chaos 
 hi luigibob can you explain as you are a prolific editor im not implying anything negative but this blanking took place N months ago and was not corrected until now 
 wow thanks so much for contacting me it looks like a stupid mistake on my part im glad you caught it and contacted me yes i do enjoy working on films especially film noirs my best 
 the amazing part is how come a whole page blanking was not detected for N months anyways you do some excellent work on films all the best 
 id like to thank all the people who made this award possible especially john macreedy (although i heard that he later 
 hola ecuador ecuador has about N articles missing from when we get around to it N articles will be added on ecuadorian towns 
 thanks for adding that link i think you just have to include an external links and copywright holder outside the box and the stupid bot will leave it alone hope you are well 
 there are problems with your suggestion which is the reason i havent done it there is a discussion forum 
 hello there and thanks for the contact to me this looks good but im afraid the issue appears more complex and contentious than i had first anticipated im also not particularly cluedup about which system is good and which is bad which seems to be part of an ongoing debate all i know is that there should be a standard system and these should be included as part of the text for settlements in the uk have you taken this to 
 sure you can help and mdash
 anything really updating the selected article updating news and categories and adding more info do did you know are some suggestions and mdash
 hi thanks for the star the film had just been on tv here in the uk so the plot details were still fresh in my mind i have now archived my talk page you were right it was looking very untidy 
 thanks for contacting meyes i think we are moving along with the article we might want to work on the intro a bit an article on just a list is frowned upon by wikipedians so we need to work on the body of the article still busy since its the political season best your friend 
 i removed your second delete from 
 sorry i must have forgot that i had already voted on that afd thanks for catching my mistake 
 just a quick note you released this into the public domain but claimed that attribution is required if in the public domain attribution is not required perhaps you would rather release your images under a free license that requires attribution gfdl or cc springs to mind perhaps you could take a look at our 
 theres absolutely no issue with releasing the images into the public domain from wikipedias point of view i just thought you may personally prefer to release them under one of the other licenses we accept if you want others to be able to use the image but want to be attributed i recommend though im by no means an expert on the exact details of the licenses 
 how have you been 
 im fine thanks for getting in touch i hope you are ok and that you will continue making a positive contribution to film articles best regards 
 i understand why most of these were done (had to change the

 sorry blofeld my main man but i only do films and not much of them these days 
 you are looking at fixing your user page up do you have any ideas of what you want on it or the layout yet 
 sorry art nor web design are my strong points anything you could do would be better than the awful thing i have know thanks 
 your redesign first draft is up on your page now see what youd like to add remove or change around and let me know

 oh and also can you add the status back in somehow 
 note what stan is referring to in bs is my comment that i had removed a few tags on this page that my images had been removed by some bot i considered it bullshithence stans bs note funny

 hello thank you for all of your contributions to film articles one issue i hate to bring up though is that the external links that you like to add to articles most notably the links to dvdbeavercom do not comply with 
 i created 
 regarding your response i do not believe the article is advertisment in its current form if you still think it is advertisment please change the deletion process from speedy to afd this will allow differnt users to have their say 
 thanks for your comments after positing a reply on my talk page i examined the contribs of the remover and found a lengthy history of edit removals and material deletions i just think hs ss was the latest victim thank you 
 if you have any questions about the permission dont hesitate to ask otherwise happy editing 
 can you expand 
 hey buddy will do when i get a chance im working on my favfilm noir and trying to eliminate all the red links on

 headdeskuN 
 i always thought the harris p N cite which covers the for tomorrow chart position covers this too anyway i am travelling now and will look into it in a few daysuN 
 i told you why i made the first edit jim douglas points out the second one proves nothing 
 unfortunately a user check confirms that the sock master you are this cannot be disputed unless you accuse an admin of lying and falsely accusing you im sorry its had to come to this but no respect for you i now have unless proven an admins lies are excuse the yodaspeak uN 
 cheers 
 you ] 
 geo swan in my experience there isnt such a grace period between the creation of an article and its tagging for deletion a prod tag gives you N days grace automatically with free reign to remove the tag with a short explanation in your edit summary speedy deletions are designed to quickly catch attack pages and those which harm the emcyclopedia and having a page reading john smells for N hours or something would truly defeat the purpose of speedy deletion new page patrolers often dont have the gift of being able to see how a page might progress but we have to make an informed judgement within policy at the time im sorry that you have felt this way about this issue but i assure you that to the best of my knowledge firefoxman is free to add tags as little as N seconds after a page is created 
 i spent some time looking and i didnt find a similar recommendation for that the guidelines lacks such a recommendation is a serious oversight in my opinion i found firefoxman tagging the article i had just created with a was highly disruptive jarring and if the two of you are central to the cabal i urge you in the strongest possible terms to revise the procedure to show greater consideration to wikipedia contributors who dont focus on deletion 
 im challenging myself to upgrade an article to ga quality around each week to keep myself writing this week its 
 yeah i was aware while writing the section that it relied heavily on reviews theres not much i can do though footnote bands like romeo void or curve arent going to have many articles that discuss the nuts and bolts of their music i simply try to squeeze everything i can out of the limited sources and represent as best as possible 
 you are correct 
 also i was thinking about the 
 ok thanks i will see what i should do 
 hi fvas hope things are ok with you i expanded the s iniae article and had 
 wow thank you you have done a fantastic jobuN i dont know how to thank you guys for picking up the torch id love to bring it to fa eventually my break remains indefinite though so no telling when that will be p 
 you are welcome i figured it was the least i could do considering all the structures you have made for me 
 hi how have you been hope you have been well currently working on something in draft form here and there but the retrieval dates dont seem to be appearing was wondering if you could have a look 
 i will be sure to fix those things in my draft by the way do you tend to purchase any guitar related mags firewind or gus g tend to be covered by them especially given his status as ozzys guitarist

 it was added by user 
 good find uN 
 all i did on the 
 ok i got your message 
 why why would you remove from 
 and again and you dont respond here so im at an impasse theres no apparent reason for this and the microformat data are useful for creating databases and lists so until 
 use the notion that they arent used very much is all the more reason for using it in a prominent fa that having been said every album article with an infobox has some haudio data and if and are used more they could be used to dynamically generate a list of all albums released by an artist a record label in a year in a genre etc without manually creating or maintaining those lists at the risk of being pedantic there is an 
 kind regards 
 ok i dont know why anthony said he closed it it was clearly me who did but anyway dont be disheartened stay with the project and in order to pass next time i would address the concerns given by the opposers regards 
 hi i deleted the article per csd gN it was tagged with however 
 oh ok sorry for not doing that i should have done it when i deleted the page tagged with csd gN looks like you have done it now but why dont we just have the 
 an article that you have been involved in editing had nominated for speedy deletion 
 thanks for your message i have adapted my message then cheers 
 awesome tracking down a copy of exit music and copyediting would be extremely helpful 
 do you think it would be appropriate to have a tour section like the 
 hey guys when are you going to get it to fac 
 should be really soon ip who i will assume is tgilmour dodds can you give it a solid onceover 
 you have been approved to use vandalsniper please let me know if you have any problems getting it working 
 sorry but unless you have a source for that that could be considered slander of wikipedia 
 i have one concern if there are books listed in the further reading section it means that article is not comprehensive so id love someone getting radioheads ok computer N uN series and writing ut the main points if there are some 
 i changed the refs because i like that you can link back to the book thats being used i just think its a neat feature and regarding the N N or N book im strongly convinced that its useless it has poor reviews and mostly focuses on shallow analysis of what it means for ok computer to be a great album and what that means in the context of what an album is and the history of the album as a format and some light analysis of the musical composition that is at best redundant to whats already in the article its in further reading because hey theres a whole book about this album out there that someone reading the article might want to look into but it doesnt mean its useful for us 
 i had high hopes for the kid a one too maybe by the in rainbows book in N they will figure out how to write about radiohead i did read through the sections on composition a little while back and its mostly information that can be obtained from the ok computer songbook or analysis of the way the track listing fits together ie the authors rather longwinded theories on which groups of tracks are best thematically or lyrically grouped in sequence 
 also i definitely prefer the citation templates i think its a good system for working with multiple books and i think its a great aid for the reader

 oh also the german albums chart reference is pretty sketchy and i cant find a replacement not sure what to do 
 the thing is other than the german chart source all the other links appear fine they just have some sort of weird unfixable redirect that the linkchecker doesnt like this includes every archiveorg link since they all redirect before displaying the archived page but as far as i can tell all the links are working fine and still totally sourceable 
 i suggest you to either make a 
 theres no rush to get this to fac id rather take my time to do a considered analysis than do a speedy runthough as it stands im currently busy with the professional side of my music writing and will take care of the article when i can as soon as possible 
 i was looking at the max ride page and you said youd rewrite once you read it my question is have you yet i would but school it being a bitch at the moment

 hi fvasconcellos in case its not on your watch list there is 
 hmm interesting i will have a look 
 it looks greatly improved now i dont see any serious problems with it 
 thanks for the information you added on the elfe pmN to this article although it seems to contradict the us faa registry data can you provide a reference that shows that the pmN has been in the uk since N basically everything stated in wikipedia needs to be properly referenced as explained in policy at 
 thanks for providing the reference it is unfortunate that it didnt have more detail than it did i have massaged the wording to include more details plus what it seems we know from the refs the faa says it was sold to the same person that the swiss newsletter says it was graham mclean so i assume that it was just not properly deregistered in the us when it went to the uk which is why the faa has it listed as status in question 
 thanks and enjoy your use of the framework 
 ps glad to hear that you are a manchester united supporter hope it is not too late for them to overtake chelsea for the N league title 
 i note your interest in slingsby aircraft any chance of having a look at 
 thanks for adding the specs just to note we dont normally use the type numbers in british aircraft articles if they have a name but as you say it may be confused with the earlier falke so i wouldnt have a problem with a rename 
 would you care to explain what was all about and nbspuN and nbsp 
 the article seems meaningless once the buzzwords are removed nothing is left of any encyclopedic value

 hi there just a quick note please dont use the word vanity in afds regardless of how much the subject deserves it it can be inflammatory and there are usually other words that work just as well see 
 i am not saying it is worthless or that it is unimportant the article was simply written like an advert for the theater and not like an encyclopedia article

 if you remove these comments here one more time i will file an rfc on your actions do not be rude i want an appropriate response to my question 
 i did not count votes period 
 nor did you apply 
 mds closure of the afd was appropriate in my opinion the article is salvageable despite its pov problems perhaps you should try 
 i was more perplexed by the inability of mailer to explain how he could read all the comments in only N minutes since his last close his dismissive attitude when i politely questioned him and the snideness of his attitude about the affair overall i completely disagree that the article is salvagable and feel that it should be merged into already existing articles that arent violations of synth and other policies 
 if you are still not satisfied with the decision please take it to 
 i suggest that if editors come to you and question you about some of your closings and you arent able to remain considerate of their request for clarification that you not close difficult afds yes i do not see how you closed the afd in N minutes i am not the only one who questioned thatwe have a right to question that and a right to not be dismissed by you with such a flippant response i have a lot of respect for your work overall and i do thank you for all you do but i also expect you to be able to explain your actions more adequately in the future again if being questioned when you close such afds makes you defensive and short in your responses then stay away from them shall i just archive all this now where shall we chat about this then since you dont permit threaded comments on your usertalk 
 seven minutes cannot be used a definitive conclusion on how much thought is given to the discussion rest assured that i have read the discussion fully the day before its close please feel free to archive this if you want to best regards

 thanks its all in a days work glad we have 
 thanks a lot for the fine clean up job thats some real nice help greatly appreciated 
 as for the move tab suggestion it is very logical unfortunately the old page is recreated for those who are unaware of the related name law hence the old version is reedited and redirecting tag is removed from them without knowing the issue we opened this arguement in the deletion review page of wikipedia and the solution offered is that one 
 please note that the above is a nowblocked sockpuppet of 
 i see you tagged this list as unreferenced and dubious the entry is not unreferenced as it links to an article that lists the ship with its source clearly indicated the dubious tag i can understand but this list is like most lists of shipwrecks one of those which will probably never be finished no doubt it will get expanded in due course 
 no problem im working at expanding the list anyway 
 please see 
 the article does not state that thomas berling has played at professional or worldclass amateur level please expand it to show notability thanks 
 although i quite often revert ip edits myself i found your reversion of the ip edit at 
 no worries you are not the only one 
 hey rcawsey i tried to tweak the makino page to make it less like an advert im still new to the wikipedia world so if you have some tips for me to continue adjustments id enjoy the feedback thanks 
 it looks a lot better now advert tag removed 
 thanks 
 i dont understand your brief assertation notability unencyclopedic it is pretty obvious in the twoline article that its a newer version of 
 are we talking about the same article its been deleted now but the one i tagged had no references no introduction no links to or from it and no possible claim to notability 
 no deal i dont have the power to delete articles only to nominate them 
 thank you for reverting vandalism on wikipedia could you also please consider using our vandal warning system first offenses get a testN then a testN followed by a testN and testN at the end of this if the vandal persists he or she merits blocking for a period of time if you do this it will greatly help us in decreasing vandalism on wikipedia much thanks 
 it is for that very reason that i have remained old school in my rc patrolling you might find the following useful if you decide to try old school editing 
 cool happy editing 
 i blocked 
 i have unblocked cunN and checked if there were any autoblocks but why the block in the first place i cant see why this one needs blocking can you please clarify 
 i was under the impression it was a sort of 
 i found the ip range and unblocked that too anyway with this username its a borderline one at most and one i think we should assume good faith with it it may look like cunt but it could also just plainly be cunN id advise against blocking this one hence why i have not reblocked the account 
 thanks a million 
 you are welcome but please unless you are absolutely sure a username violates the username policy dont block it if you are not sure about a name try to discuss it with the user first and if that doesnt work take it to 
 theres a vandal vandalizing the 
 thats not how the N rr works 
 no doubt it will pass with flying colours with all we have done p cheers 
 lol as i was actually reading lead before i only noticed the the lead must conform to verifiability and other policies the verifiability policy advises that material that is challenged or likely to be challenged and quotations should be cited not the because the lead will usually repeat information also in the body editors should balance the desire to avoid redundant citations in the lead with the desire to aid readers in locating sources for challengeable material bit thanks for catching it p cheers 
 me again i think we need to get you hooked up with 
 are you confirming that you are associated with 
 hi rcausey can i suggest that you consider informing the authors when you tag their pages for deletion i appreciate there are some occasions when further warnings are superfluous but if we dont tell people why their article disappeared they wont know what went wrong with their page most of the speedy tags generate an easily copied template for the authors user page and 
 i agree with this comment i dont like to delete any article if the author hasnt been notified 
 some articles are just so trivial and pointless its not worth the fuss 
 the only situation where i would agree with that is if the article is actively harmful otherwise i think it is worth the time and effort to inform the author what the problem is before deleting 
 N also i never receive email notification for pages on my watchlist although i have enabled that functionthanks 
 hold on N you mean that you cannot save an edit without making changes that is by design N on the second thing did you enter your email and confirm it in your preferences box on N what exactly do you mean 
 thanks 
 very sheepishly very sorry about that thats a heinous edit and i should really have looked at the page a bit closer after i was done fwiw i think i can see at least part of the error the version of the page after i messed with it is extremely similar to the you left on my talkpage to demonstrate a nom and it appears i somehow edited the diff rather than the page when i was doing the nom i did actually nearly edit the diff admittedly but saw the warning at the top of the page that you get when you edit a previous version of a page had an aha moment and went to the main version then i just typed my nom in beneath eds second nom i know i did that at the very least because when i put my nom in i copied the wording used in eds and i remember this specifically because i recognised the name of the 
 ps i can handle the trout but i do find the awards page edit summaries a bit harsh 
 no probs i guessed it might be a bit heat of the moment and the summaries are at least accurate im a bit busy in the real world as well so i can appreciate the feeling i will doubly check in future and one day maybe i will even close an acr perfectly 
 its not clear to me why you have been tagging 
 ah that makes more sense 
 was enough for the 
 replied on my talk page 
 could you explain why you tagged this as vandalism 
 see and 
 see wikipediabollocks isnt a policy being fictional isnt a speedy category 
 it isnt misinformation though in universe detail certainly in addition it isnt blatant and obvious if you cant see from the outset yup complete bullshit it doesnt fall under that 
 in what universe 
 the madagascar universe i assume what i meant was that it was internal detail in a fictional work sort of like the difference between saying rose tyler is the doctors companion and in the television series doctor who rose tyler is a character who acts as the doctors companion 
 best of luck for your rfa 
 thanks it is much appreciated 
 congratulations im pleased to let you know that i have closed your rfa as successful and you are now an

 thanks 
 thanks so much for supporting me in my rfa which passed with N supports N oppose and N neutrals i will do my best to use the tools wisely 
 good job ffm if you have any questions feel free to ask 
 so this is one more admin to beat me to my deletes or blocks or etc p anyway well done and welcome to adminship (ps 
 an article you have been involved with has been tagged by its parent project as being in need of a little attention or further development if you can help with these minor issues please see 
 these pages may give further guidance 
 i had given some thought to the idea of states setting up their own fairtax system based upon hr N the more i ponder this the more snags i run into the fairtax on the national level has been pretty much researched but at the state level for example i had wondered if there should be a state prebate but it doesnt seem we have an idea of what the tax would be in the first place or whether the tax would be on top of the federal tax or if it would be on the base price 
 would it be ok if i posted your thoughts on the website forum this is a topic of discussion btw i have also had thoughts on the poverty level issue it seems there may need to be variations in the prebate based upon local poverty levels my question would be how fine do we slice it 
 i also noticed a little error 
 dektopbsd is noncomercial restrictive image see 
 why would be usable under fairuse 
 see 
 well i put the doubt after took a decision the administrator thanks for tell me salutes for you

 oh bloody hell 
 i have changed the date posted at 
 no problem though of course its not a question of whats a good date per se but rather how much advance notice there is a month is in my mind adequate as i mentioned above so yes the N th of september is fine but more importantly is a commitment by whoever calls the meeting to do publicity for it (per the

 hi thanks for your contributions i notice that you are still autoformatting dates please see 
 excellent 
 hi firefoxman i dont think is overkill per se but i do think its better to centralize it all in 
 the logic behind placing this inline and not in sitenotice is that it will be readable now to people who are editing with 
 i wonder if i might trouble you to read this 
 oh noes not another diversion bit busy just now but have watchlisted the talk page and the article and will think about chipping in skimming the article my only immediate thought was that the medieval builder might be better as the medieval mason but thats probably just me 
 thank you so much for creating the naia dii N tournament page i have been working on dN for the longest time thanks for the help keep it up 
 i have to admit my interest was selfseeking i am a fan of the usf cougars winners of this years dN championship when i saw that it wasnt done i immediately jumped at the chance as a member of basketball and college basketball wikiprojects i love to see the basketball records up to date in wikipedia thanks too for your efforts in the basketball arena 
 i noticed that you closed 
 thank you very much 
 you are all headed to hell for this all of you i and american brit are innocent we will kill you all 
 well we are going to hell for apparently wrongly accusing you whilst you go to heaven for killing us that 
 you closed 
 no worries it happens was just making sure there wasnt a deliberate reason not to thanks 
 hi firefoxman we have never met but your name is on the list i have done a lot of reversions of vandalism but i would like to have rollback features some times a vandalist makes multiple edits so the use of the button is useless and a time consuming manual reversion is needed (pressing the undo button for their last edit copying the 
 hi firefoxman thank you for giving me rollback rights i just did a rollback its a potent tool i will not abuse it aregards 
 hi there i dont think i should be involved in this as an informal mediator as it could easily lead to accusations of a conflict of interest however i do see a problem with the sources and i will head on over to the talk page to discuss this 
 i didnt count drmies still delete which i have only just noticed i didnt go into the strength of the arguments above but i think there is no contest there either 
 i believe then that your time would be better spent in considering the strength of the arguments rather than counting the votes 
 we update the above list for all coaches all at once based on prior weeks results if people make adjustments for individual coaches it impedes the effort and makes the list misleading since it includes updates for some but not all coaches accordingly please do not update one coachs record (in this case 
 jlhcpa i saw you just made an update to the list of college football coaches with N career wins it looks like what you did was correct for the most part but updating to reflect totals shown on respective coachs wiki article is not good idea the list should be updated only to be correct if part of that process means updating each of those coaches articles to be correct thats great but simply syncing with articles that may or may not be updated is not good 
 that would be awesome if youd like to build out the head coaching record tables for the guys on the N wins list who are missing them if you decide to take that on please take a look at what i have done with guys like 
 upon further review the article merited deletion and the afd updated 
 thanks 
 your was to the afd discussion as was and was created around the time of the afd they all use the same edit summary internal links for a large number of their edits 
 thanks for kicking these articles off 
 fyi the name change you made on 
 nice looks like you fixed all this and did all the associated cleanup with the redirects excellent thanks also for creating all those redirects for the naia football programs that didnt have them 
 users who have their first edit to an afd discussion often come under scrutiny and in addition the users have very simillar edits they appear to be by the same person or persons in any case the arguments are being weighed and they had weak ones if you belive i was errent in my decsion you can go through the 
 a checkuser that zubrowka tshuku and partitas are the same person 
 indeed i did 
 damn anonymous checkusers are for the win 
 welcome back and mdash 
 ditto we have missed you at 
 the N project is a vast maze of pages now let me know if you need a guide the cd looks a bit like 
 excitement welcome back that brought a smile goodness glad to see you back wikipedia is better for it 
 thanks for your help on the dii tournaments 
 i find it hard to believe that you had both read and understood king N before inserting material into the article based on older or derivative works which it contradicts preferring less reliable sources to more reliable ones is a form of 
 i have not read king but from what was written i cannot see that hadfield contradicts king they both seem to suggest that there were pound locks constructed on the river from the ealiest phase i was merely trying to resolve the weasel words tag can you please clarify your last sentence as i am not sure what the river wye has to do with the subject 
 if you had read the article you would see that this is revisionary that the pound locks were built by sandys and the single barrier locks added by yarranton this is the reverse of what hadfield wrote furthermore it will be better to cite hadfield and norris which is specifically concerned with this waterway rather than hadfields later more general work 
 thanks for the response i am afraid i do not have a copy of hadfield and norris to refer to so i quoted the later work because it largely agrees with your position and makes no claim that particular types of locks were associated with either of the individuals mentioned he obviously revised his views between the first book and the later one and an encyclopaedia does not seem to be the place to revive a conflict which was effectively laid to rest N years ago 
 retrieved from http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or user_talktomstarN 
 i was looking for a little more of an explanation beyond because there was consensus last i checked consensus as far as wikipedia is concerned goes beyond majority opinion and expects general agreement to arise among parties involved not one person appeared to be able to respond to a follow up or support their argument with policy or precedent 
 since i reviewed the massive monster known as 
 sure i will see what i can do this weekend 
 thats kind of too late i meant asap 
 i have huge amounts of homework to do sorry 
 in that case you dont have to worry about it 
 following your prompt i have had another look at 
 its definitely a problem and they can be left with a deadlink tag which says this was available but preferably an alternative can sometimes be found as you have done if they are from a journal etc which a librarian could find they can be left without the url as long as the full publication details are included i have spent the last few weeks going through trying to replace deadlinks etc but i dont have any magic solutions and mdash 
 just a line of thanks for the work you have done on the river hull article you have made a really nice page we used to go fishing in barmy drain when we were kids and i always wondered exactly what it was that it was draining now i know the diagram especially is excellent 
 thanks for the kind words i am hoping to get the article assessed as a good article soon i have just succeeded with the 
 well good luck with it i hope you get it through its an impressive list of articles that you are building 
 hi you recently closed 
 my point is that since the other users failed to take into account evidence to the contrary it was likely premature to conclude that an informed consensus had been established since afd is not a vote and justification and evidence for a response carries far more weight than the response itself i feel that their was no evidence to support the keep recommendations by the time the debate was closed do you think i should continue the case in deletion review instead 
 sorry for bumping im not sure if you missed my message 
 listed at 
 just to let you know that i am currently working on expanding the bridges over the don section in respect of the bridges between ladys bridge sheffield and halfpenny bridge tinsley i intend to add more detail to the associated waterways template to reflect the bridges that i cover in the river don article 
 thanks for letting me know about the bridges i was struggling to find a ref for the opening of nursery street footbridge bobN evens N N december N 
 hello bob its strange how a bridge so recently constructed doesnt have a proper name and has no electronic record of its construction date perhaps there is a storyboard at the site of the bridge which would tell us more by the way i have now completed the expansion of the river don article and template re the extra bridges 
 if you do not want all the bridges to be in one section you could perhaps break it into two or three subsections based on geography also 
 hello bob thanks for the advice on footnotes you are right about the toc now looking topheavy i will investigate the best way of tackling this eg bold bullets or toc limit 
 hello bob footnotes and toc now corrected thanks for your meticulous work on providing extra or corrected information on individual bridges 
 thanks dave i have posted some further comments on the article talk page 
 hi dave the article is looking much better i have left a couple of notes on the article talk page about abyssinia bridge borough bridge and references in general keep up the good work bobN evens N N december N 
 i think i might have solved the borough bridge conundrum most of the details from the riverside cafe bar refer to the iron footbridge and not to borough bridge itself i think i have not altered the article yet bobN evens N N december N 
 hello bob i had a very brief look at the furnace trail leaflet last week and i think that this said that the bullustrade on the iron footbridge was replaced in the N s implying that the main structure of the bridge is older this would tie in with your supposition i have ordered a copy of the leaflet from kelham island museum and will update the iron footbridge section of the article accordingly if my memory proves to be right 
 hello bob i think i may have inadvertently undone some of your recent attempt to reduce overlinking in the don or bridges article while i was adding new useful links i may have reintroduced other less useful ones that you had removed i bow to your greater experience as a wiki editor as to what links are useful 
 hello bob wikilinks now rationalised as you suggest i live in derbyshire rather than sheffield but will follow up your idea about the upper don storyboard during a future visit to the city that wont be anytimesoon if the snow doesnt shift 
 mjroots thank you for your comments on my efforts with the ditton kent article i am fairly new to wikipedia editing but am willing to give your suggestion a try and if i fail i will contact you again your help is appreciated 
 i was wondering if you might assess this article again i know that you looked at it quite recently on N june but shaibalalmar and i have done a lot more work since then many thanks 
 i was looking to find a copy of what was there previously in the year that would give me a foundation for looking into recreating the article adding in the new information which would support his notability as well as looking into backing up whatever information may have been there that was questioned i feel it would be easier for me to get started on it if i was able to start from what was previously there instead of having to start from scratch i found your account through the wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles category and thus was in hopes you were able to supply a copy of this lost information to get things kick started meaning i wouldnt have to start it off from scratch thanks in advance whether you do or if you merely take the time to read this 
 i have slowly been making changes to it but since the actual page was just speedy deleted it might be time to get off my hands before someone goes through and deletes it too thus you said you would take a look would you mind doing that i added the information about the album charting which might establish notability per 
 thank you i appreciate it i too was part of the birthday committee sadly im busy working on other projects 
 im only nice when you are kind to me well thank you i like that nice comment you added oh i will review the way we was in a while so please bear with me 
 hi i wonder if you have a reference for the consensus decision or style guide for uk waterway articles to use the international icon set for a roads as stated in your recent edit to 
 hi no i dont i have a number of maps where bridges cross waterways and continue over railways and since there is no icon set for a red dualcarriageway over a railway i decided to use the railway road style on the maps i had drawn also many of the aroads are not dual carriageways and the icon looks like a dual carriageway to me whereas the international aroad design is less obviously a dualcarriageway if you prefer the old style by all means revert the edit 
 no i have no problems with your choice your comment appeared declarative so i was curious as to whether i had missed something on the project pages thanks for the explanation 
 anyway dont want to tell you what to do but thought i would explain what i do 
 i am trying to see what is missing here my original weblink was to a page which summarised various documents relating to deeping fen your see online version addition pointed to the document from which the quotation was taken which is obviously a better source so i replaced my original source with your improved source looking at the british history online page the citation now seems to include all that they suggest am i missing something regards 
 anyway happy new year 
 happy new year to you too i would certainly add the s lewis and co now we know it the page numbers are part of the short form ref because for many books there are multiple refs referring to different page numbers and it just keeps the format consistent presumably if there is a proper publisher there is nowhere for the british history online to go 
 just the url but thats pretty good not worked out what archiveurl is it requires url maybe its for things like the wayback machine 
 archiveurl seems to be a link to webarchiveorg which is the wayback machine ref N on 
 i would like to resolve our 
 alert to mjroots a new user with similar intent has appeared please see the project talk pages for details 
 you left me a message on my talk page concerning geological references i make a lot of use of the published sheets of the british geological survey at their various scales i have pretty much complete coverage of wales and the pennines and the west of england reflecting my own interests but virtually nothing for the east i find the associated memoirs and sheet explanations useful too along with any number of reports etc most in printed form but there are a number of quite useful reports downloadable at the bgss site at wwwbgsacuk on stratigraphy etc follow the geological links from my user page and you will see details of the various sources i have used from time to time i will take a look at the geology of the glen if you like or would you rather pursue it yourself by the way its good to see someone taking such an interest in waterways as you are keep it up cheers 
 thanks for the response if you would like to take a look that would be great 
 thought you of all people might like to know about the new template 
 thanks for letting me know 
 apparently twinkle messed up and didnt finish 
 you might want to provide your rationale for deletion as well 
 congratulations on getting this article to ga its an impressive piece of work and a nice addition to the cheshire wikiproject sorry i missed your message on the talk page but you obviously did not need any input best wishes 
 thanks for the comment i spotted on your talk page that the northwich salt museum has been renamed so added that in and wikilinked it 
 im planning to nominate 
 sure let me know when its ready best 
 hey im back i was wondering if you would be interested in reviewing 
 sure i will be quite busy over the next few days but i will try to have a look best 
 why it is a bad idea 
 well first of all this sort of compositing is in a way deceiving the viewer or reader besides the end result is never quite accurate and is rarely aesthetically pleasing many readers and editors also feel it is disrespectful of the subject and artist of the original works in the past even flipping a portrait or colorizing a blackandwhite photo have led to significant debate and argument this is very different from arestoring and old or damaged image to what is believed to have been its original appearance of course 
 hello im going to answer you in here if you dont mind N # no mention of his acclamation in N you could change left behind prince imperial pedro became dom pedro ii constitutional emperor and perpetual defender of brazil to left behind prince imperial pedro was acclaimed dom pedro ii constitutional emperor and perpetual defender of brazil N # what sort of employee a valet a butler a member of the bodyguard thats a good question he was certainly a free man historians simply call him an all purpose man in the palace pedro i considered rafael his homem de confianxeN a pedro ii used him as rafael grew older more as a companion than a servant N # i realize you are trying to give a sense of just how restrictive and unchildlike his early life was but this strikes me as excessively trivial and you are right on both accounts having become an orphan of both father and mother at a young age living in constant fear and manipulated by political factions and having no time to be simply be a child but a emperortobe affected him and are responsible to his character as an adult that is the man who was devoted to his office as father of the nation but at the same time hated not having ever the opportunity to live a normal life N # a bill was promulgated on N september N the article deliberately does not mention other historical figures far more important than eusxeN bio de queirxfN s such as 
 also the bridge street bridge section seems a bit sad there is a cursory mention of chantry bridge which must be one of the most important bridges historically on the whole system without the river the navigation would not be a navigation so i think we need to cover that one because of its significance there seem to be lots of facts on the ref you give and it must have a historical monuments record too regards 
 bob thanks for your comments on the rotherham area bridges as you suggest i will followup the railway references expand the bridge street bridge section and perhaps include the other river don crossings in that area thanks also for adding extra information and missing references to so many of my sections in the don articles 
 bob have now actioned the above are there any further railway references that you consider weak or missing 
 dave thanks for that i have added a couple of wikilinks i also have a book arriving which should give dates for freightonly designations and another on sheffield sewage works railways which might give some more info on jordans bridge were you thinking of adding bridges in aldwarke or mexborough 
 hi again i have just noticed a problem with the images they have an altalternative text entry this is to help visually impaired readers so if there is an alt entry it should describe the image in general terms i have had a go at altering the midland railway bridges one would you like to have a go at some of the others bobN evens N N march N 
 bob re the alt entries it would be better if i removed this parameter entirely from all my images rather than just repeating the caption do you agree with this approach to be honest i didnt properly understand the purpose of this parameter and just copied it parrotfashion from someone elses article re the aldwarke or mexborough section i do intend to add bridges over the whole length of the don or navigation but this is very much a longterm project id rather investigate the various areas onsite rather than do a deskbased exercise and this will take a long time in terms of you seeking ga status for the article i dont intend to do any more significant updates for at least N months 
 thanks for the update on the remaining section i was going to ask if you have a professional interest in bridges or it is just a hobby the pictures certainly improve the article a lot 
 alt attribute now removed from most images in both navigation and river articles i dont have any professional interest in bridges i became interested in the don after discovering the five weirs walk N years ago and since then i have set about exploring the rest of it after doing some research on the structures it seemed worthwhile documenting the results wikipedia seemed the perfect vehicle for that documentation 
 marvellous work you are doing on improving my sections just a couple of points about the jordan bridge section N rd sentence brich s or be brick and final sentence think this should be in the next section by the way is the N ian allan publication any good and still on the market 
 dave you can fix spelling anytime i am not convinced about moving holmes bridge it is not the same as holmes lock bridge and is much nearer to jordans lock than homes lock if you follow jordans bridge due east it crosses the river channel as for ian allan it was on the market the other day amazon said there was only one left so i bought it but there is still only one left today it shows all the lines which are coloured to indicate passenger freight lifted preserved proposed etc but i was hoping it might have some dates and it doesnt i would really have liked michael cobbs railway atlas but it is very expensive and does not seem to be available 
 dave if you have no objections i would like to move some of our recent discussion to the don navigation talk page as that is where it really belongs and the fact that there has been discussion about the content is good for the ga review 
 bob no ojections to moving the discussions to the article talk page by the way you have done a brilliant job reworking the navigation routemap in the jordan or holmes area it would have taken me hours to work out all the icon id codes 
 sigh i suppose somebody ought to write articles on the 
 nah that was fine now that it has enough info to be considered a real article i started the article not knowing much about vst at all so its good that you expanded on it good job and dont worry about the wikiproject thing its already mentioned in the discussion page thanks 
 i see you are an anglican priest just wondering are you a priest at a church near boyd 
 oh okay i meant the richmond one since i live around the corner and saw that you too are from richmond 
 carlos when you say that cities in mexico have a legal definition what is the definition you have in mind 
 thanks id like to withdraw my nomination if you have no objection 
 i addressed the concerns thanks for the review again uN 
 all scores are accurate as of N N april N 
 thanks for responding i just thought my additional information would be useful to readers who havent been on the planet long enough to get the we are the world reference but im the source of the information although it is agreed by blogging fans all over the internetuN nothing that you would approve as a areliable source i just read the article on verifiability why didnt you just tag my sentence instead or help me source it 
 i have made a few initial observations 
 i wasnt laying the blame at your door i know how difficult it can be to develop an article started off by another editor and what pitfalls there can be 
 let me know on my talk page when you think you are done 
 i wasnt taking it as blame or criticism since writing on wikipedia i have learnt the meaning of summarise in your own words which i was never really very good at when they asked us to do it at school 
 you had reverted a blanking of 
 done 
 thank you 
 hi dave i needed a picture for the river maun article and found one of yours on geograph which had been copied to commons so i have used it thanks however it is called mansfield river meden trail but shows the maun as the meden is quite a bit further north i dont know that there is much to be done but thought i would mention it 
 thanks for pointing out the error the photo shows part of the maun valley trail not the river meden trail i have corrected the title on geograph but i dont think i can now change the title on commons 
 i have put in a rename request on commons 
 what i saw was a current proposal with a whole heap of opposition (
 even before you most recent comment on my talk page i unprotected 
 fishhead you have got to be kidding me with your disingenuousness in all of this there is a revert war going on at 
 you say what is disingenuous is your support for a redirect in order to have your will prevail over against the consensus of the editors what thats absurd on its face im not the one whos preempting a vote that i am losing you are the one going against the consensus of the editors you further say you either think it should be a redirect or you dont you absolutely can merge articles into a redirect until then it should remain a redirect all thats going to be accomplished by creating a disambig page at 
 bob you have added short references to squires but there is no entry for the book can you add the book details thanks 
 i was working on it but there was an edit conflict and i saved the wrong bit locally i had to retype a load of stuff and then the server was locked and i lost it again the third attempt was ok i nearly know this section by heart i have created a proper bibliography now just got N onwards to do 
 sorry about that you can usually cut and paste in the browser window if the back button works when you get a server problem 
 thanks for adding the refs etc on 
 if you think any of this is pertinent i would be happy to have a go at the alterations required i have not put this on the article talk page in case this was not what you had in mind with your request 
 thanks for all the comments and please feel free to put on the talk or pr pages i have been thinking about the multiple use of references but i have never got my head around harvnb referencing templates your help with sorting out the maps would be really appreciated i dont quite understand the comment re images on the newbury to reading section and mdash 
 on my browser there are two images together at the bottom of the section which creates quite a bit of white space 
 i have moved on up a bit does that help and mdash 
 yes i have never used harvbn templates either but use the notation all the time as the writer of 
 i have revised the book references as you suggested perhaps youd take a look with 
 looks much better imho so much less cluttered although i normally only include surnames since the real harv template does not use first names 
 following comments above i have just worked out how to use the harvnb template it is great but sometimes needs the bibliography to be above the refs unless there is a full screen load of stuff below the bottom of the bibliography otherwise clicking the ref cannot scroll the page far enough to make the book appear as the top line of the page still not sure about the lead since it has been trimmed right down as part of the peer review 
 if you want to tackle the harvnb and or or the lead thats fine by me i have been working on history following lots of comments at 
 i have changed all the book refs to use harvnb shall i change all the images of england ones to use the ioe template 
 i saw what you were doing with the book refs thanks im never sure about the ioe template as i have not seen it used in a way which includes the publish and the title and accessdate both of which are required before going near fac although looking at 
 the main advantage is it reduces the huge amount of clutter in the text 
 possibly an advantages for the editor but no advantage for the reader and one extra thing to be challenged on at fac and mdash 
 i will take that as a no then 
 if i said that it would be 
 the developers here had a contingency plan long ago for this very situation just look in the history section and put your original material into the temp subpage uN 
 i just saw that the page was deleted however as i am an administrator here i have access to the deleted text uN 
 i will take a look soon 
 i will get back to the article soon i have been distracted by some other things lately 
 i will have a look once zag has finished the larger changes keep me posted 
 people are free to jump in whenever they want at the moment im spending most of my time trying to clean up some blps of nba players i will try to do some more work on 
 yeah but if structural changes are still being made then it doesnt make sense for me to copyedit can you give me an idea when you will be done reviewing the structure 
 i wonder if youd like to take a look at 
 by all means 
 a question about your recent edit on administration is this in fact the case you would know better than i would but it was my impression that at least in canada we kept a fully open table 
 the practice varies depending on the piety of the priest and or or parish i suppose that dioceses may have guidelines in this regard the rubrics of the bcp state that it is the duty of a parish priest to refuse to administer communion to those s or he knows to be living in grievous sin who refuse to repent as well as to those in the congregation between whom hatred and malice exist similar rubrics exist in the american prayer book the bas is silent on the issue in any event the discretion of the priest has never been superceded by an injunction to communicate all who so desire at least in north america given the more conservative nature of other provinces i would be surprised to find anything more permissive there 
 this is an automated notice by

 hi is there no chance that you could take a photograph of rcmp officers in the uniform we dont have a picture of 
 alas i am one of those luddites who still uses a manual camera and i dont have a scanner 
 one further thought on 
 i dont think it has been discussed elsewhere it is a bit of problem particularly on long canals if you put all the bridges in the map is too long although there are some maps around where every bridge including insignificant footbridges are included for a canal i generally limit it to aroads motorways and railways if i start the map and then include any others that are mentioned specifically in the text on a short canal i may well include lesser bridges on a long one i may well miss some out particularly in towns looking at reading my sources show bridges numbered N N and N and then N road bridges and N railway bridges before the thames bypasses usually do not have numbers if they are reasonably new i also notice that some of the railway bridges are marked railway path so i think they ought to be in dead railway colour its not a very precise science 
 i have been through and moved one or two numbered and named them where possible but there are several that have no numbers or names on my sources 
 great work thank you i can see the argument for not including small tracks etc do you know if there is any logic to the bridge numbering the specific example i had in mind was on bd after sydney gardens tunnel we are missing the bridge of the aN which is quite a major road in bradford on avon we are missing the aN there is a railway crossing at hilperton also on the bb map we seem to be missing the aN at newbridge on the western edge of bath and the aN and aN in bath itself i am not that familiar with the symbols so some of these may be included but me failing to spot them i am also less familiar with the canal beyond devizes but could try to do it from maps if that would be useful and mdash 
 i have been brave and attempted to do the bridges on the bb map and one on bd please check i havent broken anything looking again at some other sources the aN goes over the sydney gardens tunnel and i have no idea whether a symbol exists for a road going over a tunnel and mdash 
 there is no symbol for road over short tunnel my maps show both tunnels crossed by parts of the aN i have constructed the symbol with overlays putting a road symbol on top of the tunnel symbol i have also renumbered bridge N and named it it was numbered N which is baptist chapel bridge and is below lock N the map is not strictly correct as bridge N is actually above lock N and was the cause for the construction of lock N or N 
 thanks for continued work on these although pearson doesnt number the bridges on maps the collins or nicholson guide does so do you want me to add numbers to bridges where they are included or should i stay out of your way and mdash 
 i was getting the names and numbers from nicholson too so you might as well add them as you go 
 i have just noticed that the ioe template now includes a wikilinked english heritage which seems to have been added yesterday 
 ok i will add bridge names or numbers as i get the chance in the light of that change i have no objections to the ioe template but still seems like extra work for limited benefit and mdash 
 the ioe template seems to have added double full stops after 
 the template is locked so i have put a call on the help desk i will not do any more for now 
 ioe template seems to have been fixed on bb map bridge N a railway bridge appears to be missing but i dont know the correct code to add this one and mdash 
 how many bridges do you want N and N are already shown but the bristol and bath railway path crosses again at N N and N and N is part of the same dead railway but is not officially part of the path 
 all the edits bar the bolding were wrong and had to be undone the manual of style and the naming conventions cover the rules on wp articles 
 you seem to be much more interested in this than i am 
 not really just got into it on wp because when i came here first the pages on royalty were a laughing stock so a gang of us turned the royalty pages from an embarrassing mess into proper encyclopaedic articles as a historian i also like to see facts correct 
 hi skookum sorry that i didnt reply to your earlier notes i have been refighting the 
 im about to start on the yakima cayuse and palouse wars for 
 ps its skookumN as in skookumone kind of like a cb handle came from when i couldnt get skookum@telusnet and settled for skookumN @telusnet but i have liked it ever since also my fidoca email 
 i was doing the same but you were faster by several seconds uN 
 heh that happens to me all the time 
 ok re bridges point taken another thought on 
 i wasnt making a point just asking a question re the bridges i was going to put N on for you and then spotted the rest on the start of the maps i think pigsonthewing produced them in N so i dont know why he chose to start at hanham i was tempted to add the lock into the harbour when i was fixing k+abb but assumed there was some reason for starting at hanham the new cut map is a bit weird as it tries to ignore the docks which provide the navigable route bristol docks and the avon dont seem to have a routemap i think i would add the locks cumberland basin and the suspension bridge and leave the rest to the narrative shall i do it 
 if you could that would be great as you are much more familiar with the symbols etc nb i will be away for most of the next week (at 
 my understanding has always been that the definition of lower mainland is very informal since it does not officially designate anything in particular what i think it means may not be what someone in prince george or gibsons or whistler or clearbrook might think the same goes for the other regions after all why not separate the interior into the southern interior the northern interior and the central interior and why does that regional designation supersede others such as the okanagan the boundary etc any articles need to reflect the diversity of viewpoints 
 thanks for your help with this article which is now at 
 i have not previously been involved in a fac but will keep an eye on the page mentioned and attempt to resolve any comments that appear 
 simple answer they are wrong its not too surprising really as its a very common misconception and you cant really expect the writers of royal websites to be legal experts its a fundamental tenet of peerage law that the sovereign cannot hold a peerage and the title of duke of x is associated only with a dukedom not a duchy as the 
 thanks for taking the time to respond 
 is a cite from alttalkroyalty that answers the question and contradicts proteus assertion 
 proteus is correct see my post at 
 ah yes thats a problem i should really have considered earlier ah well as long as its sorted uN 
 no problem ^_^ uN 
 i have responded to the discussion on that page thanks 
 i am very sorry about that i was using vandalproof and sometimes when reverting a number a of previous edits it will go back too far and remove good edits i have only been using it for about a week so i am not familiar with all its intricacies it looks like you were able to go back to the last good version without much problem though which is good now that i see whats happening i will make sure to be much more careful next time 
 well good thing for the assume good faith rule saved my butt 
 thanks for addressing the issue with 
 you are welcome it was nothing much just some citation issues 
 please either unblock or ask for review of this block calling it trolling in your edit summary doesnt automatically make it so and i dont see that they received any warnings on their talk page 
 its been reviewed by another admin and im perfectly happy with the block the guy is evidently not editing in good faith right hes claiming he has faith in um a flying spaghetti monster 
 and yeah its silly but its not blatantly offensive or anythingand while the faith part of his comment may have been trolling other parts were relevant to the conversation a warning or at least a block notice would have been appropriate 
 im quite happy with people being silly but theres a difference between making a joke and acting out a parody in a context where its just disruptive and a waste of other peoples time i think its appropriate to send a message that its not going to be tolerated indefinitely 
 i think a message to that effect on the users talk page along with a note that you would block if the behavior continued would have done the same job i strongly disagree with blocking without warning except in cases of blatant disruption but i dont care enough to argue about it and like you said its been reviewed by another admin now 
 i didnt mean to single out saanich i removed other like north vancouver before must have been readded it used to be that there were many many more even whisler was on that list for some reason 
 with reference to your last comment yes i agree with you i think it should take the form of a new header it should also be made consistent across the country however as i believe that these problems exist with other cities as well what do you think 
 or maybe it sohuld be changed from city to place that is the lingo that statscan sometimes uses 
 thats probably a good move im just a little concerned about consistency seems that a lot of energy has been spent from other users making thiese things work across the board i dont know how they will react 
 yeah the newfoundland template looks like a good example a good place to start anyway 
 N bc must have different rules about what constitutes a city than alberta because i think thats more than any other province in alberta for example very few places under N are incorporated even though some are technically allowed to be and there are a few places over N that arent either yet in saskatchewan there are some very tiny cities anyway thats interesting i would just make sure the list doesnt get too long should be easy to access information and im not sure how many users visit 
 i think you two have worked out a good solution to the city conundrum thanks for resolving this issue 
 thank you for reminding me once again that wikipedia admins think the are written for everyone but themselves if i thought you people have any shame id tell you that you should be ashamed of yourself 
 you are welcome 
 hi just a note to let you know that you are occassionally posting your message to user pages rather than usertalk pages also if you are going to post this message many times please take the time to have a quick read of

 request that you unblock 
 catholic priest google yields N 
 i engaged in that little dance with you so you would know what it is like to have someone else define you and it made you angry now you know how you have made many many catholics on wp feel with your constant edits and talk page antics on the rcc page you aparently need to experience this to have even the slightest empathy amazing for anglican clergyman who by reputation tend to wiegh the complexity of every pastoral situation even to the point of looking relativistic unless aparently this has to do with the name of the catholic church 
 for the record i do not oject to any church using the term catholic or even calling itself part of the catholic church acording to its own understand of that i am not arguing religion here i am arguing against a campaign to deprive the catholic church of the use of its name that you have been most vocally a part of and your fellow anglicans have been doing the same across wp why does one group get to decide the name of another group frankly i dont really care what the name of the society of catholic priests calls itself i really dont they should call themselves whatever they want i tinkered with their article name to make a point because this is exactly what you have done to the catholic church really we catholics would like to just be left alone but anticatholic have dominated the catholic pages on wp this includes yourself fishhead just allow us to use our name for gods sake its not that complicated 
 this article should be about early christianity or the title changed to whatever its supposed to be about there is plenty of stuff that is largely irrelevant to early christianity currently in the article such as the overly large section on religious writing that would be a good spot to trim if you feel the article is too large such an article will always be big as the topic is big many books have been written on the topic 
 as i said elsewhere if want it done then go split it up i have done much to split out things on this article already 
 i came here for the same reason but 
 sure its already been unprotected by 
 it was rightfully redirected after afd now the same ips and disruptive users are back and putting garbage into the article what am i supposed to do 
 this does not belong on wikipedia and theres an afd to back that up the current version is quite possibly worse than the version that existed when it was originally sent to afd in the first place 
 the source of the disruption is fravia recently passed away a lot of people are now coming to wp to read about his life in a single page only to find that there isnt any coverage of him the reason wp members are having such a great difficulty in fixing the page is that they are new to the wp and unaccustomed to the way of things here they are filled with emotion and pov given the fact that a very great man has died recently and fravia was a member of a scene that didnt get any media coverage due to misc controvercies and the personal nature of the reversing scene i can assure you searchloresorg ironically is one of the most credible places to find information on the topic of advanced internet searching and enlightened software concepts if you know of a site with greater credibility in the field plz make mention of this in the discussion section so we can contact them and request that they do a story on the mans life you i have to say are not doing a very job of criticising the members of this site frequenting that page you are in contest with and it is exacerbating matters this will not go away with mindless blanking of the page its just going to frustrate members and result in a waste of everyones time 
 please familiarize yourself with wikipedias policies perhaps you are not aware of what afds are also please 
 if you have any questions please dont hesitate to ask another fellow member and we will be happy to help you again welcome we look forward to seeing you around 
 you had some good quotes in the paper today wasnt exactly pro wiki but what can you do 
 yeah i read that today too needless to say i didnt know his focus when he asked for the interview i still dont know where he pulled that quote from the bob stoops article i didnt see it anywhere and i went back through the history a little nevertheless any exposure to ous articles should be beneficial 
 dutch i lack nuance lets say but i have a dutchaustralian friend who is ready to go one problem i have found with quoting anything but especially translated works is that you have to read at least the whole article to get the authors true opinion for example i have just read hummels pages on the divine light mission and maharaji and i would describe his attitude towards prem rawat and his work as understanding and tolerant and occasionally respectful this does not come across via the few quotes given in the texts and to be fair to the author and to prem rawat it should again i think good paraphrasing is the answer 
 good paraphrasing is extremely difficult and the history of the article 
 i disagree the history of this article shows that quotes lead to counterquotes and more quotes and it becomes a terrible article i agree that paraphrasing is hard and will require a mutual desire to see the article work for everybody but if we dont get it we will all grow old here 
 your recent edit comment does not really address the issue of why my edit is not acceptable in an article predominantly sourced from two websites of equal verifiability than my source im not for a minute suggesting that the website in question is in the same league as print media but it is certainly in the same league as wwwgreymanslandcom or wwwandmcnabcouk whats the story 
 i have no comment on those other two websites but the claim is about the identity of a living person for whom the revelation of his identity may have relevance to his personal security the sources used therefore have to be beyond reproach 
 just curious you signed lollipop lady oo 
 no i was reverting something that N removed or changed a previous warning by someone called lollipop lady before adding my own i did admittedly mess up the revert though uN 
 ah got it thought it was weird that youd give them a new warning signing someone elses name 
 yeah now that i look at it i can see why you thought that lol uN 
 wwwandymcnabcouk is mcnabs official website greymansland is a fansite with no links to mcnab hence not valid when it comes verifiability therealistbravotwozero website was created by an enthusiastic wiki contributor who saw valid verifiability fail on wiki so then created a website to make the same information verifiable that would be the same as saying hitler was born as a woman and then create a website saying that exact same thing and then say it must be real because it is on my website i think not so in my opinion mcnabs official website is a reliable source greymansland and the realist are not 
 as the anon says see also 
 right that is a much shorter way of saying what i meant to say 
 you do know that any user can do a move if the target name is not being used right 
 yea i have seen that some people are not happy with these moves but given the track record and the logic they will happen thats why i suggested the move on the ones with red links your choice but i beleive they will happen 
 in response to your recent request for page moves please read 
 i agree i was a bit vague when i first asked you it was N in the morning here and i was tired but that is no excuse anyway categories to be renamed should be listed at 
 pls see 
 i dont know whether i have done that but see 
 hi fishhead i have started putting together a worklist or assessment page for the project which is currently located at 
 the page is up now at 
 hello i have volunteered to mediate this case please see my comments over at 
 thanks fishhead but im really just an observer to the mess i will kick in whatever i can im not sure if the disputing parties will really come to the table 
 matt i am updating the 
 i think the current is at the original resolution im afraid sorry 
 please see the talk section of

 hi fv i noticed there was a comment at 
 it also looks like 
 hi ed thanks for letting me know i will fix them asap 
 um the cN of the indole at the centre is lacking stereochemistry also is there a reason why the top left ethylen bridge is pointing upwards cheers 
 indeed it is will get that back in as for the ethylene bridge i agree its unnecessary but thats how it was displayed in my original sourceuN which i cant find now

 hi please see the ] for my recent posts on it as you know it was extended as i had had an unfair block during most of its duration please read my posts in full lengthy as they are and follow all links or cites and read them and then please reconsider your position 
 thank you for your confirmation of my thinking may i copy your comment to the talk page discussion involved or better yet would you add a similar comment to the discussion on the talk page 
 in other words i need to do some background research so can you recommend any good books or websites that discuss such practices 
 the page listed at 
 gallocatechol is listed as the first name at 
 look at the relative number of citations for gallocatechol gallocatechin and epigallocatechin for example in geometrically increasing order in say references for each in google scholar there may indeed be different uses in different fields but it would seem in terms of relative significance the word epigallocatechin is in more common use particularly since references to its gallate ester are legion it may be proper to list it as such in mesh but for an encyclopedia the term epigallocatechin seems far more appropriate i will crosspost to 
 as far as i can see you are not currently assigned as a coach to anyone at 
 thats okay you dont have to be an admin to join just many are i was just spring cleaning happy editing 
 i just wanted to stop in and make a comment i notice that we have a difference of opinion in the rcc article sometimes argumentation can mask the greater communion of anglocatholics and the greater church and i just want to take the chance to express regret that as often happens we end up talking about the rather small areas of disagreement rather than unity so i apologise if my style of argumentation can be harsh at times uN its something i need to work on cheers 
 hey joseph regarding edit these kinds of edits while not harmful are also not necessary see 
 uN and again please read 
 just so you know the templates etc have all recently been replaced by a template which has the functionality of all of them and works just the same 
 thank you for your help in cleaning up the zh templates best

 hi leyo im afraid i havent been around much im glad it was replaced because mine was missing the allimportant nitro group best 
 if you have any questions please feel free to ask them at the 
 thanks for adding the license tag but i think we need the united states copyright status of the image in order to host it on the english wikipedia this is because the english wikipedia is hosted on servers in the united states uN 
 if you got this picture off a web site a link to where you found it would also be helpful uN 
 probably via http or or wwwbcarchivesgovbcca or which if its in their collection they will have the date and the photographer but dont be misled by their copyright claims which are only claims 
 could you please give me a link to the exact page you are looking at i cant find this particular image on the bc archives web site also please read 
 hm you are right its not on the bc archives site and i wasnt the one who added it must be a scan definitely this picture is from the N s his beard was a lot longer when he became premier in the N s 
 iuN m afraid i cant help you with this one as i know longer have the postcard of this ship it seems to have gone missing when i recently moved house 
 in my experience this often happens and unpacking after a move always turns up stuff that went missing two or three moves ago i recommend that you move house again 
 ah well never mind 
 hi you might be interested in this user 
 hey i was coming to you for some arbitration and found my counterpart got here first tell me what is wrong with the material i put on tec i think a quote from N lambeth is fair as it is the heart of the issue also there seems to be a hangup about not mentioning homosexual ordination or anglican realignment in a heading and these are the heart of the current controversy please be fair when you look this over thanks 
 far be it from me to go around telling other editors on wikipedia what to edit and how to do so but i also do think that these many small edits are in aggregate becoming a problem for the quality of the articles in question what do you think could this be a workable solution can you think of any other way to resolve this problem 
 well first off lord capulet threatens to disown juliet thus turning her into a street child second there should be a description or two on count paris true intentions with juliet does he want to marry her for love or does he want to marry her simply because her family is rich 
 any good library or bookstore should have these available 
 it is also not npov to obscure the protestant nature of the anglican communion the word the church of ireland missionaries say the british monarch swears an whatever else the anglican communion is it also protestant in nature and to ignore that fact is distinctly a minority pov 
 the methodist presbyterian and lutheran churches all profess the nicene creed and also define themselves as reformed and catholic the anglican church is not distinctive in that regard in any case the purpose of the image depicting the major branches of christianity is to show how they branched not to describe the nuances of the theologies of the branches it is a fact that the branches differ in size if you believe that the size of a religious group is indicative of its validity then perhaps you should reconsider your own affiliation if you believe otherwise then you shouldnt object to that characteristic being depicted

 hi reinyday i have been noticing your sig on wpcfd this is probably something you know all about but you do know about being able to use four tildes to sign dont you or have you done some fancy trick with your signature to stop it linking back to your user page 
 now i have edited my 
 ah that explains it makes it harder to get to your user page but cut and paste does the job anyway makes for an interesting looking sig though slowontheuptake people like me may still mistake you for a newbie occasionally 
 i was gonna wiite you about whats goin on but i lot my glasses earlie and its too cumbersome working with the screen on increase++++ so this is being typed nearblind i was wanting to explain to you by private email about everything but your wikimail isnt switched on you can contact me also through my email which is on wwwcayooshnet or wwwmyspacecom or tamanassmans message system im afraid i got a little er heated no thats not quite the word vehement just now with 
 btw you are just the person for me to give my mission to nootka by father brabant ed charles lillard which is brabants journal of his posting to hesquit and matlahaws attack and lots more on nuuchahnulth life and politics belief custom etc its not my area of bc for keeping books around on but im downsizing and am reducing my library for now this next week only keeping my core lillooet stuff having loaned the rest of my hsitory stuff to my friend who runs http or or wwwfortlangleyca but noticed brabant just after i posted here i will vbe coming to victoria in may intending on playing on the causeway and who knows where else or i could mail it to you as its small booklet sized not even N or N inch think anyway still typing blind gnite 
 if you are interested the 
 i finished todays focus letter reinyday N N february N 
 just saw your post on the talkpage i have looked through your recent edits and there doesnt seem anything obviously wrong with the discussions you have closed what do you mean by archived discussions 
 no those are the ones that need to be closed because they have been there more than N days thats exactly the ones you should be closing 
 the heading is old discussions the bit in brackets below about archived discussions is a link not a description of the pages below 
 i didnt realize until recently but congratulations on your pregnancy 
 thanks reinyday N N october N 
 fishhead you have removed the tag from your own upload 
 given that the photo appeared as part of an acns press release with instructions on how to credit it does this not constitute fair use i cant find any fairer use images of individuals in anglican orders but i can keep looking thanks 
 thats not relevant what is relevant is that if wikipedia wants a photo of anglican nuns we can get a free one for example being an anglican priest it should be especially easy to obtain a free photo of nuns in your place of worship see 
 congratulations 
 thank you both reinyday N N july N

 hello i want to mention that when you add a category to templates it makes pages look bad for instance 
 thanks im working to fix it now uN reinyday N N july N 
 they should all be fixed now uN reinyday N N july N 
 its fine when you have time we can definitely work on it just drop me a note when your available and i will do my research 
 hey so finally i get the first season dvd apparently a relative had the dvd i just forgot that they owned it anyways i took some notes of some useful info but im debating whether or not to include it so i would rather you add it or not but just letting you know according to mccormack 
 yo im more or less on a break from life right now but i noticed your edit and wanted to thank you that page is not very finished clearly and will take a long time to get right for now the page is unfinished and is not likely to be finished soon im working on a bit of a side project with wiki though and will be adding it to my signature when finished thanks for the edit though its nice to see other people working with arcane templates happy editing 
 thanks for your message i was thinking it would be really fabulous to use the show or hide feature of 
 hmm maybe the problem is that due to all the incest most of the tree isnt directdescendant unless theres some classification system for greek gods that i dont know about im not sure how that would pan out admittedly it would be cool to just hide and show branches of the tree 
 im looking for at the least the name of the film and a reference or link for the game but any info you have would be most helpful its mainly for the work im doing on the 
 the game is minor but the film was apparently a mainstream film if i knew the name i would have put it in the article but unfortunately i dont do you know when 
 no it would be very helpful if you could name the sources used to started the article 
 with a bit of clever web searching i worked out the answer to your question at 
 thanks uN reinyday N N july N 
 hi there i found your name at the french wikipedians notice board and was wondering if you could help me out im currently putting in some work on the 
 rex as the context from the het wilhelmus article makes clear the title means another song about the city of 
 hi reinyday must say very impressed with the fantastic job you did on 
 thank you so much for letting me know that you liked it with such a big change i wasnt sure if people would approve the feedback is very welcome uN reinyday N N july N 
 any more problems let me know and i will permanently block him i really dont like timewasters who are here for reasons other than editing articles 
 thank you so much the situation was distracting and was making me feel bad and it is nice to have a relief from that behavior uN reinyday N N august N 
 thank you for your work cleaning up 
 my pleasure thanks for taking the time to write me this note uN reinyday N N august N 
 hi i have had a go at editing the article i thought a few points could be clarified you should be able to see my queries in this i think you should also ask someone else to copyedit the article 
 i have fixed two of the points you raised but cannot do the natural lifespan i dont think anyone has researched it and it would be very hard to research as you cannot collar them and chipping them would mean you would have to find them again thanks for your edits 
 fabulous thank you so much uN reinyday N N august N 
 hi i have unblocked the ip you asked me to unblock the ip was blocked for repeated vandalism and edits of a malicious personal nature i realise these edits may have been made by somebody other than yourself but this person seems prone to disruptive behaviour and will probably be blocked again if not by me by some other administrator i recommend that you continue editing under your registered name and not as an anonymos ip so that your useful edits can be judged separately from whatever vandalism is done out of your ip as for my email address for personal reasons i would rather it not be linked to wikipedia i apologize for this but you can email any other sysop and ask them to unblock you direct their attention to this comment on your talk page 
 unfortunately blocking the ip will block you from editing from that ip even if you are a registered user im just saying you should always edit as a register user so as to build up your identity and reputation that way admins will be more likely to unblock you if you have been blocked as the sideeffect of an ip block 
 id like to comment on on 
 yes i am disputing this thats why i removed the tag the claim of original research was based on and finding no results however searching for finds N results and finds an additional N results so i think it is clear that natural units is a term used in euclidean geometry and i changed the article to reflect that belief since i am not familiar with this particular mathematic term i said i think my changes reflect the correct idea indicating that i might be wrong also natural unit currently redirects to 
 i found that there is an article on 
 the material entered is original research thus there should be no google reference to it it is a set of natural units but the method of derivation is different just as planck units has its named page euclidean natural units should remain a named page i am having difficulty with mathml thus have been unable to enter the mathematical process to illustrate how the enu are derived mathematically it is simple but trying to explain how it works without the equation sets is difficult 
 i dont understand i dont know what you mean by a named page i dont understand why you want to explain the derivation if it is original research please feel free to do what you think is best as i said im not familiar with this mathematic concept uN reinyday N N august N 
 if i allowed due to in an editing job my colleagues would change it to because if you dont like that word at the start of a paragraph why not reverse the order of the clauses i have no problem starting with because in this register 
 imo nothing wrong with due to but it becoming should be its becoming as the gerund takes the possessive 
 thanks for the birthday note lol sorry i dont see yours listed on your page but happy belated birthday 
 when is your bday 
 ok well hope you had a great day 
 enormous thanks for your recent work on

 i look forward to reading it uN reinyday N N august N 
 whose sig did you like on the help pagethere were threewhere could i go to help you edit you are awesome or could you walk me through a larger edit that fixing typos >d 
 i was talking to the person who had posted above me people generally post replies below the previous poster and indent them to show that they are following one conversation i was saying that i really liked your indented signature if you are looking for articles to fix try picking some from 
 you might also want to ask for suggestions from 
 i see you asked this question at the help desk that is a good idea since i am not an expert in this subject good luck uN reinyday N N august N 
 hi restored above as requested by you please do as you and others may decide bye for now 
 thanks uN reinyday N N august N 
 im doing the y haplogroups articles in the catalan wikipedia (see 
 im sure they will its fabulous uN reinyday N N august N 
 hi was just looking at 
 all the characters show up for me so i cant tell if i have fixed the problem for you i have added a unicode template does it display properly now uN reinyday N N august N 
 no its still all full of little linked question marks apart from the transliteration line when i look at the code they all look like this or 
 yeah it means that you dont have a font that will display the rune characters you could probably find a font that would work to download the links will still work to go to the relevant articles and most articles have images in them uN reinyday N N august N 
 i have already merged frog adaptations and frog 
 great minds think alike 
 watermelons are not in the citrus family i have reverted your could you explain why you made it thank you 
 it was simply a copyandpaste error i was putting images in categories thanks for fixing my mistake uN reinyday N N august N 
 could you explain to me the difference between a described species and a known species i dont doubt that theres a difference but it seems a strange term to use 
 thanks for the clear explanation my eyes are opened sorry about the edits well not the grammar ones 
 my inclination is to revert but let me know what you think 
 to find many items the process is to locate the main article click on the disambiguation link and scroll down to find the correct item i doubt users would give up from following this standard proceedure i surveyed a number of articles pointing to trees and they were almost all intending the tree article and not one of the alternatives perhaps once the links are fixed to read 
 fyi the frog was removed from the pool right as it was being quickly photographed it or one of the same species has repeatedly jumped into my suburban swimming pool and we have had to atttempt to remove it as it swam through the chlorinated water i will admit it is not in line with the rest of the pictures on the article and i am going to of course also delist it from the 
 i see what you mean photography really isnt my specialty anyway have a nice day 
 hi you made an to the links style article that essentially reversed a style recommendation im curious where did the first recommendation come from and where was it decided to reverse it i thought the first treatment made a lot of sense thanks 
 i combined two different sections into one paragraph and then they seemed to contradict each other uN reinyday N N september N 
 thank you for the rapid response i think the change is a pretty significant style recommendation to be made while reorganizing an article i will start a talk page topic with a suggestion 
 i have restored the sentence in question per your comments uN reinyday N N september N 
 i have made an attempt at rewriting that section and rationalizing the two recommendations 
 hi there no problem whatsoever those three are now moved and please feel free to leave me any more requests as id be happy to help cheers 
 no problem there are a few double redirects that need fixing i fixed a few of them already 
 kindly check this page http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlehyderabad_ per centN india per centN and actionhistory on N th oct at N hrs an administrator removed an external link that he or she felt was an advertisement however whoever added that link came back in a few hours and readded that link but this time by editing an existing link that had been part of the page from earlier and changing it to the link that was deleted by you can you kindly look this up 
 hi i dont think i removed any links i just formatted them as references uN reinyday N N october N 
 thanks for the reply you certainly did not i just noted that you have been active on this page as an administrator and wondered if you could rectify that change that is against the spirit of wikipedia i could make that change myself as a user but i thought it would be in good spirit if an administrator did it since the original change to remove an advertising link was made by an administrator 
 i understand the confusion that line in the original message and changing it to the link that was deleted by you should read and changing it to the link that was deleted by the administrator sorry for that ( 
 hello again first i am not an administrator i am just a very active editor please restore the link that you think should be there you as a user should feel free to make any changes that you think improve the wikiepdia uN reinyday N N october N 
 i guess i used the term administrator for editor the problem is i am associated with that site and am not sure how much in the spirit of wikipedia it would be if i did it myself what is the process in such a case 
 please lets do it 
 i have done my first edit over to you i will contact pstevendactylus who else joyous and lejean

 why did you restore a subjective definition of notability without participating in the ongoing discussion at 
 first i did post about my changes second that is the definition of notability that existed at 
 im sorry you edited the guideline before you posted to talk and i jumped before waiting a couple of minutes the fact that the subjective definition has been there for two years might be why so many people complain that notability is subjective which is the problem we are currently working to remedy please consult the ongoing discussion regarding definitions of notability 
 i see that you have commented on the talk page i apologize for jumping the gun i will reply there 
 that entry has no related article and no way of verifying the information feel free to readd once there is an article about eric uN reinyday N N december N 
 i do not doubt your intentions but the article still remains unverifiable as of today 
 agreed hence im happy with you adding to it i have also added regards 
 the same thought occurred to me there are plenty of examples of missing species being rediscovered im mostly surprised that nobody had an interest or succeeded in breeding them in captivity 
 if you think about it another way its not really that surprising a species that is difficult to find in the first case might be expected to be close to extinction 
 can you explain 
 im listening as well 
 hi there i saw you moved the page i have seen it written variously as go go gogo and gogo there really isnt an official name for it as far as i know but its good that go go redirects there 
 i was just going with what was dominantly used in the article and the majority of links to the page uN reinyday N N december N 
 hi i did some work on the article 
 i think this can turn into a better article i added it to the jewish life template which i see you have seen by your edits 
 hi theres no reason not to have a unifying article and then separate articles pointed to with the main template ztl is within 
 thanks for taking care of 
 thanks for checking though yes i guess i will start with the general references web of science has not yielded the answers i was looking for at least so far 
 hope you enjoyed the holiday watched fireworks here from the 
 very nice thank youi havent seen the fireworks in dc since about N or so 
 the location doesnt allow me to get pictures like the one on your userpage but is convenient and able to stay indoors until the rain stopped when the weather is nice its fun to get a spot by the capitol and hear the music maybe next year 
 nah your image is fine i always hanged out on the grassy area between the reflecting pool and the washington monument getting there by N am and parking by the lincoln memorial near the river id spend the day with family or friends checking out the band and the museums it oftentimes became a N our affair due the outrageous commute home about N miles west of dcbut always worth it probably would walk N or more miles each time i went i imagine that now it is almost impossible to get a car into some of the places i was once able to 
 so you hung out on a grassy knoll that figures 
 hahayou betcha but i have lived to tell the tale so the federal agency with no initials didnt get us all 
 i have listed a category you created 
 i have also listed 
 when editing 
 this is not standard for wikipedia articles uN reinyday N N april N 
 man im thinking of shooting the tiny creature all the day i cant promise though not really an easy job and there seems to be no public display i will try anyway btw how many frogs do u keep 
 good luck with your new creatures too that sounds a truly meaningful undertaking but i heard that taking care of frog takes much time isnt it 
 the creature seems to have another name besides philautus romeri im confused could u help me figure it out thanks a lot 
 btw i have seperate the 
 i use that site too the site is really great man all the taxons are there indeed i have added a footnote about the classification in the article but im not sure one should use the old or the new name in the taxbox what is the common practice 
 thanks a lot i have expanded and revised the article hope u can go through it when u have time btw do u think the 
 it is standard for projects to have their own standards which may supercede the wikipedia general standards for articles within their own projects 
 i dont think that is true please read 
 thanks for the note you might be interested in 
 you might know better the nature of formatting 
 i have tried please let me know if i can be of further help uN reinyday N N april N 
 looks great thanks the row with the line pointing to the mtmrca is gone now but it seems difficult to get that in there for me without haplogroup h shifting all the way to the bottom left of the template regards 
 i dont think that line is appropriate since it doesnt exist for any of the other descendants uN reinyday N N april N 
 sorry if i have made you a little impatient but i have been trying to find ids at a herptology site i know however nothing has turned up yet i dont have any other pix of the frog as it jumped away as soon as i took it a little info if you want taken in east gippsland victoria australia in a low creek 
 sorry yeah sure go ahead 
 thanx for your work on the id i will upload a correctly named pic soon 
 the reason why i and the other editor feel about the merge is that the article on 
 as is linked in the merge template the place to discuss your proposed move is at 
 as it seems you were pretty much the only person who had an issue with the merge that is why i posted to you directly 
 as you made the merge without having any discussion about it how could you know if anyone else had an issue with it uN reinyday N N april N 
 the discussion is at 
 for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria 
 well hmmm i thought this was weird looks like you created the nine iron page as a redirect to a golf related page and someone went over it and replaced the information about the band nine iron instead i will put the deletion notice on their page too sorry about the confusion 
 thanks for the heads up i recreated the redirect so people can find what they are looking for when they go to that name uN reinyday N N july N 
 hi i found you on that youngocelot guys talk page while i was scrolling through it and you seem like a nice guy would you mind acting as a mediator between me and codyN on the urban dead talk page he insists that the big bash deserves a mention since it nearly destroyed the human population of the game but me and the other guys dont think it does since well it didnt i have tried telling him he can mention it if he doesnt sound too biased and i have tried telling him it wont make it since so many people are disagreeing but he refuses to come to an agreement 
 hey i shouldnt have to act as a mediator anyway no matter what the situation different users should be able to talk things out on the talk page without trouble if one person refuses to listen then theres not much else they can do until they break the three revert rule besides i know nothing about the subject at hand anyway uN 
 if you can provide me a link to my edit i will explain but as you can see from one of the previous edits i was using vandal proof and havnt exactly been on the ball tonight so it may be that i made another error uN 
 pls would you also revert the message on my talk page regards 
 bah thats whats happens when you dont pay enough attention i have removed the template you have my apologies uN 
 hi reinyday i notice your new pages on some nyc school topics esp 
 yes that link shows the program as expanded im not an expert on the subject i just created the article because multiple pages linked to it im hoping that someone with more expertise will expand it uN reinyday N N september N 
 this message was placed automatically and it is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists if that is the case you can remove the tag from the article and it would be appreciated if you could drop a note on 
 hi theres actually only one page 
 ps if you work for march of dimes the information on your website for how to opt out of selling my contact information doesnt work which is really frustrating i did walkamerica once but wont be participating again until there is a guarantee that the money i raise wont be used for animal testing uN reinyday N N december N 
 why do you keep removing the quote from the reception and criticism section of 
 given the thirdparty opinion expressed on the article talk page do you agree the quote should go back into the article 
 i dont agree we should get another opinion 
 you have two third opinions already 
 please stop reverting the insertion of the quote both netural opinions agree it should belong the wikproject guidelines say it should belong 
 uN reinyday N N december N 
 no it will never change both urls point to the same page and both urls will continue to work and be valid uN reinyday N N january N 
 you forgot to sign 
 oops now signed 
 btw are you aware that there is a separate incident of 
 the way around the air france flight N problem is to dab by year should the recent aN article get deleted then a hatnote on the other article can point readers to the correct section in the air france accidents and incidents article 
 okie dokie~ 
 seems to be standard operating procedure 
 all too common im afraid its a testament to how much of a nuisance sockpuppets often are on sensitive pages have dropped a tactful hint 
 you may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the 
 with things like now you are just being petty what more do you want i have admitted that you are right on the point of law given you leave to input it and your reaction is to make petty little edits like this and while accusing me of being childish i have no problem with you including your summary of how the case went down in the article the only reason i reverted your edit as stated in my edit summary is that it removed other things i think that you rolled your three previous edits into one which explains why your last reverted edit contained other things id disputed lets not get petty here put your summary back in the article on its own without making wider changes that i have disputed 
 well done for changing the page good work 
 thanks for the redactions is it worth getting a third opinion at the reliable sources noticeboard vis a vis the use of law textbooks for points of law 
 not a problem i dont know if he does or doesnt but it had been listed on the page since i can remember and i dont remember anything previously listed about a glass box then i saw sinked i assumed it was yet another joker sorry for the bother 
 at the end of the said episode he is seen worshipping the fonz therefore he is either a member of the church of the fonz or simply worships him uN 
 no problem uN 
 no problem about being quick on the button cheers for letting me know 
 glad you are fine with it 
 my b marinus photo aint that great its only a juvinile and is a little unfocused around the head however it has has many red coloured tubercles on back which isnt really demonstrated well in the other pics i can upload it if you want however if i do i will leave it up to you if you want it in the article 
 i have got a few cane toad pics if you want them uploaded 
 i have uploaded the picture and put it in the taxobox on the b marinus see if it is better or not 
 should the name in the taxobox be changed from giant neotropical toad to cane toad to go with the articles name 
 thank you for your message yes you are right i started moving however noticed that there are some difficulties with the capitalisation i posted a question here 
 in english names are capitalized and regular nouns are not so even though the word 
 please read 
 thanks for explaining i consulted and found that the text had been removed without explanation uN reinyday N N february N 
 hi reinyday im sorry about that 
 no problem at all thanks for letting me know i already tagged the article as nonnotable so im fine with it being deleted uN reinyday N N february N 
 thanks that group is of interest to me i appreciate you taking the time to contact me uN reinyday N N february N 
 your very welcome there was a 
 i will take a look later when i get a chance 
 thanks 
 ps my hope has been that if i can just get the article past ga then i have ammunition to fend off future malicious edits in other words by having it pass ga i have a blessing from a neutral party that says the article is at least in somewhat good shape as such i can justifiably argue that if i believe a given editor is harming the article i can insist that we discuss it before edits are made or banners are placed in the article 
 you removed the talk about the biobarnstar that it was passed what happens then in the end 
 great thanks 
 re 
 hi please dont take my reversion of your last edit the wrong way it isnt that i dont want you to contribute it is just that copyrighted material is not allowed on wikipedia so i had to remove it id be extraordinarily pleased if you wrote a solid history section like the one has in the main body of its article though i will note that several years ago the lutheranism article had a history section and someone removed it and put it in a separet article it was entirely unusable because of severe pov issues and no citations however although i was glad to see you sourced your addition it was to a church website rather than a published book or other resource of higher reputability 
 i restored my content as i did not see it as copyright violation and it was properly cited i have since expanded on it please do not to anything else this is a standard wikipedia section that people expect to find please see 
 the text was taken verbatim from the website you cited it from but without quotes but it is such a small quotation perhaps it is only fair use anyway i added some more history material to your introduction that takes us most of the way from N s naturally there are gaps to fill and a need for even more citations i moved the history material down the page because for now this is a work in progress if we can find something on the spread of lutheranism it could be a nice segway into throughout the world possibly it could even be combined with throughout the world or even church fellowship over N people visit the lutheranism page every month so out of consideration for them i think it is best to have the most developed sections first if the history section gets longer and more developed it could replace 
 the text was not taken verbatim thanks for expanding the history section im not very familiar with the topic so i cant add much it should be the first section you do not need to move sections that are in progress if more people see the section they can help work on it users expect to find certain things and i try to facilitate helping people find what they are looking for uN reinyday N N april N 
 your welcome i wish i could recruit those that know more than i do in the edit log you noted that history should be first i have noticed that while some denominational articles like 
 if you need any info on neobatrachia there is some on page i dont know if it will help but anyway 
 ] wouldnt be bad for the list is it was cropped i tried but neither of my photo editing programs would open a gif file 
 so you just want the similar species of the cane toads natural habitat 
 so after i wrote the australia similar species part you put it into the taxonomy section 
 the whole similar species is repeated in the taxonomy so the whole similar species section should be deleted 
 rannuN eN xeN irtxed anaiuN eN bnid ( 
 if that is designed so that things like and can render separately then it could address the main outstanding use case in a post of on the board you asked about having the software fill in details based on partial references that is probably possible too though i think other things would have to happen first 
 thanks anyway rannuN eN xeN irtxed anaiuN eN bnid ( 
 i put in the citation for the success rate on the cane toad page 
 me and 
 if you got to the toadbuster section on page there is some information on the cane toad traps and may help with the citation needed on the cane toad page 
 i found the exact page it is one i dont know if it is what you want hope it helps 
 images are to be categorized at commons i think you have been here long enough to know category is up for deletion and the file page here at wikipedia is to be removed 
 the category exists as does the image page if you remove the category before the image page is deleted you ruin peoples ability to navigate to that image page through the category system and thus prevent their ability to comment on the deletion of the image there is no reason to remove an existing proper category from a page before the page is deleted uN reinyday N N august N 
 just to let you know xonus has started a thread at

 looks like were heading for another taxonomy discussion on australian frogs this time the moss froglet whether it belongs in crinia or its own genus bryobatrachus i know that the majority of the sites that we use for taxonomy class this frog as being in crinia however this frog is often classed in its own genus tadpoles of south eastern australia by marion anstis classes this frog in its own genus as well as the when i went up to hartz mountains in tasmania there were a few signs all calling this frog bryobatrachus nimbus the reasons for it being in a different genus than crinia are pointed out very clearly in the tadpole book the tadpole development is completely different from all other frogs in crinia you probably know this but this species eggs are laid in moss nests and tadpole development is entirely terrestrial no frog in crinia comes even close to this form of development in fact the only tadpole pointed out in the book as being remotely similar to this species is assa darlingtoni and that species is not classed in crinia no other genus that i know of shows so much difference in embryo and tadpole development 
 the classing of bryobatrachus nimbus back to crinia from my interpretation of the paper seems like unlucky timing basically because rounsevell described the differences between the moss froglet and the genus ranidella so when ranidella was merged into crinia it meant that the differences between the the moss froglet and ranidella were no longer valid so according to the paper taxonomically bryobatrachus and crinia are currently the same basically because no one has gone and repeated the work of rounsevell but this time between the moss froglet and the genus crinia so the moss froglet at the moment cant be considered in its own genus i guess that on wikipedia it sould still be left in crinia however when someone gets around to writing the article for the moss froglet it should be made clear that there are very strong differences between this frog and the rest of the crinia genus and the synonym of bryobatrachus nimbus should be in the taxobox also it is probably worth noting that on the 
 i havent read the paper yet but what was the thing that prompted them in merging bryobatrachus back into crinia 
 i think its ready for gan good job with all of the changes 
 i have reviewed this article and placed it on hold at the ga nomination page pending the addressing of some minor concerns you can see my comments at the 
 i am happy to say that i have passed this article congratulations 
 the biggest challenge you will face will be over the technical quality of the writing fac reviewers love to nitpick the minor points and i am not the best at dealing with that ahead of time yet many of the things i often get hit with at fac i tried to cover in my ga review nounplusing citation styles endashes etc so that should help you avoid some difficulty there in my personal view the article is pretty much complete and you have already had a peer review so fac is a decent first step i might suggest asking a couple of other baseball project members to take a good look through just for the extra set of eyes before nomination good luck 
 i just finished my exams on friday so i have some more time on my hands i should be able to do some of the family maps but i would need a reference to work offdo you have a website where i would be able to get an idea of the distribution of each family 
 i will have a go at a few as well 
 i did the map for the leiopelmatidae family however the distribution is very hard to see even in full resolution should the image be cropped to just nz or should the distribution be pointed out or circled 
 hello aaron on N july you made an edit to 
 thank you for that i have no idea what happened there i have reverted that edit 
 the more i look the more odd it seems i have never even seen before so i certainly did not put it there on purpose 
 thanks very much for all of that 
 no problem feel free to leave a message at any time cheers and mdash
 hi there i appreciated your comments on the 
 article now at 
 hi aaron i am impressed by your indepth analysis of the afds you have closed would you take a look at some current rfcs and perhaps summarize and assess the consensus in them i have requested that rfcs be closed at 
 thank you but it would not be appropriate for me to do so i have been doing other stuff for a while and may be out of touch with current methods please note that N per cent of my recent closes is at 
 the other option that would help oil the wheels of the mighty pedia is a spot of arb enforcement on trouble pagesi limit myself to mundane niceness at 
 ahh yes 
 no worries maybe after a few months you will get back in the swing of things and be able to close rfcs although i dont believe your close was wrong i believe your closing statement of 
 im glad that you are not injured by how the drv is trending especially with inflammatory comments like which was wholly unnecessary best 
 advice 
 weirdid 
 if you me and froggydarb are all going to work on the family maps we should probably coordinate it so that none of us are working on the same family at the same time as it would waste a lot of time and effort if we discovered that someone has just finished a map of a family at the same time that someone else was working on can you suggest any sort of system for this 
 i striked out the ones that have been done i also left a similar message on 
 should the family maps only be based on native distribution ie if bufonidae was going to be worked on you wouldnt include the area inhabited by the cane toad in australia 
 yep i thought it would be best to only include native distribution as it would get ver complicated with some species 
 no a platypus is a type of animal like a cow or a mouse or a bear the fact there is only one specific species of platypus doesnt mean its a special case that overrules grammar 
 yeah i have a pic of an assa i am thinking of writing something in the intro before i upload it though should be up by the weekend 
 the 
 its awful i love it 
 hi srkamal i have deleted the images as you requested it was no problem at all cheers 
 oops missed that one thanks for that casliber 
 please do something 
 as per the disclaimer at the top if you are in any sort of hurry it might be better to ask someone else looking into this now but my time is limited today so a response may take an even longer time than usual 
 i have been slightly distracted but this isnt forgotten or ignored thanks for the patience 
 i have passed the 
 all scores are accurate as of N N may N 
 eucalypt dominated open forests comprise N per cent of wollemi national park with over N species of eucaplypt recorded the remaining N per cent of the national park is comprised of rainforest heath and grassland which is it N and N or N and N i want to check with you first before anything gets changed 
 i think that a list of threatened species for the wollemi article might be a good idea i was going to write out just a few examples until i did a search and discovered how many there are what do you think 
 hi aaron there is a arbitration happening and going by some of the admins comments it was clear some of them where not reading the all the different pages to did with this arbitration which is why i posted on the listed admins talk pages to try and clear up this issue could you please unrollback my edits 
 apologies to you both for jumping in here blackash i have commented on your talk page i disagree that rollback was needed here but aaron brenneman does have a point that this is not the best way to communicate it would have been better to start a centralised discussion at the talk page of the arbitration cases proposed decision and then leave a very short note for each arb asking them to comment there after that you can assume that their attention will be on that page and you shouldnt need to leave any further notes by repeating the text across multiple pages you risk any discussion occurring in multiple places oh and admins and arbitrators are different roles on wikipedia it helps to distinguish the two 
 no you are correct carcharoth there was no need for me to use the rollback button this was neither hugely disruptive nor requiring serious speed and i could have first taken the issue to blackashs talk even undo would have been just fine at the time my thinking was to stop the discussion metastasising but i was rash and rude really a low point there 
 no i fine with you rolling back i just didnt know the best way to go about this thanks i comment as you suggest 
 do you think it would be possible to claim fair use of a rheobatrachus image i know that we cant just go grabbing every image and claim fair use but realistically it is going to be very difficult to encounter a new free image or for someone to get a new image of one rheobatrachus frogs are very important animals and i think an image could add some value to the article does wikipedia have policies on images of extinct animals what do you think we could do 
 ok i think the next step then would be to ask someone who is an administrator and see what they think 
 thanks for your note i have replied by email and nbsp 
 now i dont see any email link at all maybe you should double check the preferences entry and nbsp 
 and nbsp 
 christ in a sidecar we have got a template for everything dont we _ 
 did you mean judge dredd 
 now im imagining that guy from breakfast club with a natty do ^_^ 
 congratulations to your adminship from all the frogs of the over and underworld 
 please do not move discussions to a subpage when i specifically didnt post it there 
 im noting that things you dont like get subpages while you edit war to get things you like to stay on ani please do not do that note that i objected to the subpaging to begin with but was told everything should stay together 
 this is not ani and the an request is separate i will revert it because it shouldnt be moved 
 dude this is why you get in strife you are totally inflexible and appear to believe that reverts are your right 
 just thought you could use some levity to the whole situation 
 i do indeed thank you 
 it seems like someone wants to merge this into the nascar drivers category we had resolved this but now it is a case again please help support the category we have put too much work into it to let some people who have no idea how crucial it is to the organization of the nascar wikiproject to reverse 
 well it seems like we lost this battle i really dont understand the reason of the merge i will not be working on any former drivers lists in the wikiproject in a protest to the merge now our work will be ten times harder and ten times lengthier it is a lot easier for people to say something that they dont have to do 
 the change hit my watchlist hard too i see nothing wrong with requesting or even demanding help from the people that voted to force the merge to fix the implications of the merge especially when you guys clearly explained the problems imo they shouldnt expect that their ambiguous abstract explanation will fix everything 
 i recommend no further noticeboard stuff i believe an arbcom case to enact the topic ban is the only viable alternative 
 im in agreement shocked and appalled having never been in the middle of it and only having watched from the sidelines but in agreement i was really looking forward over the last few days to actually editting articles thanks for the note 
 concur the novio close at anN is completely perplexing since there is a clear consensus that a violation occurred i am at a loss for words let me know when it starts and i will throw in my N cents until then im going to leave the situation alone in the great hope that the situation will get better 
 first of all i dont consider the move legitimate as it was not listed on 
 i indeed have little interest in the issue given that i contributed N or N articles i cannot follow discussions concerning all of these let alone the articles where i was not the only contributor as was the case of daphni otherwise i would have to leave my proper paid job to discuss my articles with casual editors who have little else to do if i see crazy proposals on talk pages i prefer to remove the article from my watchlist and not to think about it again its a pity for the article not for me cheers 
 hi there just wondering but why did you revert my edit to this article the members of the advisory council save for 
 not about sesame beginnings but close enough to not warrent an extra section you seem to be copping it a bit sweet over at the afd for daniel r anderson et alii partly from me just wanted to make sure you werent taking it personally however seeing that you have been around for donkeys years im sure you are fine i have made a placeholder at 
 ^_^ 
 the dashes at the end really make this one 
 aaron i was surprised you are an administrator i was looking at your contributions have you discovered the main issue wikipedia articles what do you want with me please feel free to spit it straight out 
 i apologise for being thick as two planks here but i have no idea what this comment means can you say that again a different way please 
 do what you think is best but i must admit i am laughing my arse off at your blatant hypocrisy i dont mean that in the metaphorical sense i mean i laughed to hard at what a ridiculous smallmined petty puffedup comment you have dropped on my talk page that my arse actually fell off its stuck down one leg of my pants there are fluids of various colours pooling up around me but i cannot stop laughing at this comment please do another one go on 
 i cant believe that im seeing such uncivil comments from an admin who is meant to show the community to follow the policies and guidelines 
 good work on the origins section i have had a bit of a look for info and been struggling to find any cheers 
 lol thanks 
 yeah that works out cheers 
 oppps 
 hi your personal attack is just too much please comment at 
 yeah thanks for the note 
 why not just take yourself down to 
 rob you took this to ani it would be best if you commented there rather than continue to escalate here please 
 hi i have largely rewritten this article see 
 the new flora article is up if you want to help out fungi lichens and nonvascular plants could all use some expansion 
 im not part of s posse our work has considerable overlap and i have contradicted much of his opposition because of that i have frequently stated and continue to maintain that i have no friends here and have no wish to have any here i have taken to task on issues before and will be quite happy to do so again as i see them arise i have his talk page on my watchlist and continue to monitor it for nfcc issues that arise he does considerable work in this arena and its right up my alley to watch the traffic there if disagreeing with people who argue against nfcc enforcement makes me part of some posse then im happy for the label and will wear the badge with honor but theres no motivation on my part to defend as an editor just heavy motivation to defend 
 post script jumpin cats i actually got out of bed to write this give me a list nfcgnome of things to do im always rabbiting on about helping out new users so point me at some 
 my head is spinning on a variety of other points right now and i havent had time to read your modified response above it might be a few days 
 your proposal is interesting but now is moot arbcoms chosen the nuclear option masems right they are not addressing the real problem their decision to topic ban is ludicrously inept its as if a bunch of people set fire to a house where john doe lives and arbcom arrests john doe not to say that has been perfect but the abject failure to address the real issue is appalling 
 thanks for helping out with the article but i dont like the seperation of the table it stuffs up their widths at my resolution i also dont see an advantage to it so it seems like it has been worsened aethsetically for no gain what was the reason for the change thanks 
 well just the general idea that when you have two things you should have two tables i see only a small white space and the table borders i dont know how it could affect the widths of the tables which i see as exactly equal 
 i got it up and working thanks so much i finally looksomewhatprofessional cries out of sheer delight 
 hehehe glad your happy dude ^_^ uN 
 just would like your opinion on what else should go into the article all the inline refs are done i know you wanted winter breeding habitat to go in but i still havent been able to find anything about it do you have any papers or websites that have something about that cheers 
 opps typo thanks but is cant really write anything on winter habitat then is there anything else that should be included in the article 
 yep thanks 
 thank you just being human 
 in spades 
 with bells on 
 a victim of ongoing policital outburst and being terribly vandalized could you please get it protected as soon as you could thanks 
 by the time i have looked at this it was no longer happening 
 on an unrelated note im getting cognitive clanging from your username as it bounced from msnicki to the lesssensiblebutstilltrue 
 okay i think you meant to stress that you werent voting at all you were offering an analysis that tried to follow the guidelines and which happened to lead to a clear outcome you didnt start with an opinion and then look around for support you did a nice job 
 hi when i was making the fauna of ausralia article i made this admittedly lame 
 neat thanks 
 thank you for the note but next time try talking to me first id have tagged it for speedy d as no one but me had ever edited it 
 the above issues have been taken care of 
 this is why for files that i may save in various different versions i append the date to the file name in the weird order N why ncurses suggested we do it that way for the biology portal could well be a different story 
 i program a bit in perl 
 nice to know that you are using linux gnu really is the best for usability and power out of all the nixes how did i survive before i discovered 
 best humor of the day as for the freudian implications well 
 snorts drops monocle implications young man i know not of what you speak my sausage is world famous id post a longer reply but as this is being posted from a wireless device and the train im on is about to enter a tunnel i will have to finish prematurely 
 thanks for your help you have made some great improvements to the policy distinctions are now clearer without reducing information about the spirit of the law ftN has proposed a table that clarifies things even more a few of us are working on it at his talk page we would appreciate your input 
 im updating the 
 so shall we put this one to 
 is that a message for me i thought rfcu was last resort no 
 yes thats a message for you checkuser is a last resort but the accused states that he did not engage in sockpupperty and says hes ready for cu so i think we need to drop the charges or take him to cu 
 ok well he admits it on the ips talk page in plain sight but i can take him to cu not really sure how to but i bet i can follow instructions 
 done though i dont understand why that was necessary 
 we will the thing is that he might be right there is a possibility that he used that ip only once and that he didnt use it for sockpuppetry therefore we need a cu 
 i sincerely hope to help the whole thing going forward irrespective of how the 
 back to fxeN specifically one of fxeN s numerous personal attacks is that i own the article my N edits over N months compared to fxeN s N edits over just a short N months contradicts that indicates fxeN owns the article recently not me but we all know it is not possible to own a wikipedia article i believe fxeN was just expressing frustration at not being allowed to construct the blp article to fxeN s specifications without adhering to wikipedias editing policies any attempts at mediation are likely to be unproductive if we cant at least find starting common ground in wikipedias editing policy for example fxeN sees content deleted because blp demands it be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion and fxeN then claims it was repeated blanking without reason fxeN sees the introduction of nonnegative content and claims it therefore must be promotional material or an attempt to advertise there appears to be a serious disconnect here anyway i appreciate your offer as a broker but it appears fxeN is not too fond of that idea now thank you again for the time you have spent on this matter regards 
 this post was meant as an fyi item aaron this means that i trust that further understanding is up to the receiver of the message it is about xenophrenics conduct and should compliment your view of the exchanges you had with fae best regards 
 i have been working on 
 most of the info was taken from the genera articles 
 no worries 
 thanks i would of forgot i knew it was going to be on the main page today but i was out all day tadpoling at darkes forest it just slipped my mine thanks for the reminder 
 llittlejohni spawn and tadpoles lverreauxii spawn and newly hatched tads c signifera spawn and taddies and a few newly hatch ljervisiensis i think thats all 
 you forgot paracrinia i was there as well we went with marion anstis so it was a good day 
 an administrator 
 no he isnt i am though is there something you need assistance with 
 hey i was wondering what is about you are an admin arent you uN b 
 cancel the champagne cocktails still an admin that was my thought the last time it happened that id been deadminned but its just that somethings wrong with my skin and i occasionally lose the administrator functions from the top i have found that if i change my preferences it comes back but in this case i have got a big nap planned in a few minutes and couldnt summon the energy 
 what skin are you using 
 how odd i was just thinking of you i just use the default vector 
 thank you for closing that discussion it was going on too long as i understand your close you were expecting more expansion during the afd i did add a good encyclopedia source and turned up lots of other sources which promised much potential for further expansion i was waiting on the close before doing more please could you 
 now at 
 thanks 
 now at 
 thanks for that 
 per comments that bulwersator and myself made on the afd i thought an article written from scratch would be appropriate on the more general topic so have gone ahead and written one at 
 i was expecting that tsk the original article has more than enough content now for mainspace and so i am moving it back there now 
 four stories and a centuryold taxonomy tsk tsk thats hardly an encyclopaedic treatment 
 hi ev i will find out more about it and hopefully i can contribute something to expand the article regards 
 hello again ev did you see the recent news about new guinea they found about N new species in papua province of indonesia western new guinea 
 man thanks for askin never tried to take a photo of a frog am in an inner city burb and the only ones i have seen are the brown marsh frogs next time we get a downpour i will give it a go i have been trying to snap a few birds and been to museums in sydney melbourne and brisbane for dino skeletons in the past few weekscas liber N N august N 
 im afraid i cant help you i may do a lot with fpc but i cant take a good photo to save my life i dont see too many frogs around my place anyway 
 that i didnt catch the new acr for the fortifications and ottoman task forces before you did thats supposed to be my job i will be quicker on the draw when i get caught up on my acr copyediting and reviewing dank ( 
 you dont have to apologize if you look at my editing from last night you will see that i have a general routine that i do when i have the time and catching up on acr or pr or fac or far is one of the first things as to it being your job not so much as any other coordinator who notices it i just happen to be the first a majority of the time or the others leave them to me to do 
 i will be honest i leave them for you if i see them the problem is that i rarely see them before you have posted all the notices uN 
 okay then i will use the same approach i use in my other work wait N hours and see if someone else does it dank ( 
 aaron your closure of 
 i dont see how that adds up to a clear rough consensus to delete particularly under 
 if you think the close was in error please feel free to take this to deletion review as im not seeing any reason supplied at this time that would make me reverse my close 
 to be fair there were no responses to bagumba at all until the N th day and no need to stir the pot since the vote count was N until then the afd was then closed within within a short time after two delete votes were cast we disagree on how this should have been closed but i dont question your good faith i have never taken anything to deletion review before always been content to let the chips fall where they may this is the first time i have really taken issue with the process i will consider deletion review but given the time pressures of the work week ahead i will probably just drop it thanks for explaining your reasoning though cheers 
 i think you have got a tenable position on the timing of the last few contributions im happy to take it to drv myself i dont view the venue as punitive at all i too am pretty flat out but id rather do that that get it wrong watch this space 
 i think your best bet is to reread the peer review comments not all of which have probably been addressed 
 i made a list on my 
 your dedication is really inspiring great work nice photos too 
 my mental to do list for wikipedia just keeps growing id like to take a week off life and just sit down and get through it 
 now at 
 this is the benefit of seeing drv as a nonpunitive venue perfectly good call all the way around the best result of this additional discussion is that more eyes are drawn to the issues 
 i too am pleased with that outcome 
 this page has a long and tortuous history but the short version is that netoholic started moving pages before there was a general agreement several users complained about this but netoholic took no notice i suggested that we hold a new poll to establish a true consensus i suggested to usergtrmp that he prepare such a poll while he was doing this netoholic once more acted without the consent of the majority and instituted his own poll which was configured to either endorse or reject his unilateral movement of pages and did not offer users the chance to make other suggestions this poll was defeated by a clear majority but netoholic took the decision to extend the deadline at this point i created the poll that you now see on that page the poll is open and is open to further embellishment should you wish to extend the list of options i have not set a close date as i believe i have already imposed myself too much on the process i am therefore a little disappointed to see your name in the disapprove section however as i have just indicated i do not intend to impose myself too much on that page other than to stem netoholic and his inability to treat other users with respect so i invite you to discuss the matter of additional options and the deadline for the poll on that page btw i should point out that i originally prepared a poll in a similar format to that on usergtrmps page but several users complained that it was overly complicated so i simplified it to what you see now 
 hi mintguy im sorry if i have done something inappropriate i probably just misunderstood the situation i thought that part of the proposal for a new poll was to achieve consensus on the wording of the new poll before voting started i thought that that was why there was an approve or disapprove section since it seemed to me that the poll on usergtrmps page was better i expressed an opinion to use it instead you did actively seek out my opinion and i gave it again if i have done something i shouldnt have then i apologize 
 i noticed that there have been a few new photos coming into wikipedia lately and you have been creating aticles to go with the photos do you what other species are likely to get photos soon so i might be able to write a few articles as well 
 just on the note of the neobatrachus frogs i will be heading out west in october and i should be able to get a neobatrachus sudelli photo 
 now that you have reopened the afd you need to restore the article otherwise people wont know what they are commenting on i also plan to do some work on improving the article 
 the article remains deleted for the afd to be effectively reopened the article needs to be restored so that it can be viewed and improved 
 argh sorry i did restore it but was a bit sloppy and left the final meesage on the page just needed to be rolled back one 
 hi there i noticed at the deletion discussion for the virtual classroom set up by the transhumanist you said the following comments like also worry me do you mind if i ask you why my comments worry you and what relevance my comments had to the deletion discussion 
 thanks for the response i have effectively withdrawn my levels proposal as i now agree that this is needlessly complicated i still have worries about the name of the program for which see the talk page over there 
 thank you for thoughtfully tackling the closure of such a contentious afd david 
 thank you 
 what david said 
 piling on i read the discussion and was left with pretty much the same impression and considered closing it the same way but didnt have the time or energy to write out the rationale as cleanly as you did thanks 
 i respect your closing decision and think you made some good points but when you say that later keep arguments did not respond to points made in earlier delete arguments im surprised you didnt note the same in reverse most of the delete votes even after the discussion had been going on for a while called on notinherited and failed to address the argument made several times above there are more keep votes than delete merge and redirect votes combined which i think should also have been noted 
 you said that significant coverage on the articles subject independent of her husband did not appear to exist there were new articles about this man which werent just connected to his wife being a politician both of them are notable for the coverage of the clinic they both owned he is the one questioned and quoted about it 
 this is not the deletion discussion you are mistaken in my role in that debate if you think that you need to convince me 
 could you expand your closing statement it does not mention the various proposals to redirect or merge the content in the discussion at all 
 so you really should be responding to their comments with something other than you are mistakenif you think that you need to convince me 
 agree i have to say im flabbergasted how anybody could read a consensus to delete out of 
 aaron is right about this the comment he declined to answer was not about the success of his closing rationale at capturing the discussion the comment was about whether the outcome was correct or not it is not the role of the closing administrator to 
 im not sure i really have a suggestion as to what to do now but i did want to point out my agreement with sowhy which comes from someone who was basically on the winningloathe as i am to use that term in reference to an afdside of the debate 
 see at 
 and the majority of my comment where i noted that most of the delete arguments were pretty shallow as well 
 im curious why you didnt consider closing it as no consensus which would have been the most accurate summary of the discussion imo 
 i have photos of a number of species of their entire life cycle take a look at my 
 after having a detailed look through my photos i found i have photos of metamorphs of the following species litoria peronii l fallax rana sylvatica and heleioporus australiacus the only one that has a decent amount of tail is the heleioporus however the photo of it showing the most tail isnt exactly focused and the frog is in my hand sorry but thats all i got if you would like to use any i would be happy to upload them 
 i have photos of tadpoles spawn and frog for several species but dont have and froglet photos at all i reckon lim peronii would be easiest i think that we can just use your lim peronii pic to illustrate the frog i will go and get a few pics now if i cant find any metamorphs i might be able to get a llittlejohni metamorph pic this weekend cheers 
 i couldnt find any metamorphs in my pond and all the spawn had hatch im going to a site that has mixophyes at the end of this month but id say that the mixos wouldnt be metamorphing until sometime after january unless they overwintered 
 did you find any morphs while swabbing 
 what species did you see or hear 
 my mum has been raising some tadpoles at her place we were raising them to test my identification skills as i am not very good with tadpoles they turned out to be lim peronii she is going to take a photo of it and send it to me tomorrow before releasing would you be able to find your best tadpole and egg photos hopefully mums photos come out well otherwise it will take a couple weeks and i will go down to her place after the exams when another is morphing we have the amplexus photo for these guys so that is a plus the cycle should be egg > young tadpole > mature tadpole > morphling > adult >amplexing pair thanks 
 i have a good photo of lim peronii spawn as well as some young tadpoles i can upload these photos today after school i will also have a look to see what else i have 
 here are the photos 
 hey evan when i was out frogging last night i got a photo of a litoria verreauxii metamorph with the entire tail i have photos of the spawn from that species but i dont think i have a tadpole shot do you want me to upload it or were you going to get a lim peronii metamorph so they can all be the same species 
 if the photo you want to compare with is the one on website then i am fairly sure that that frog is not bibronii when i first saw that photo i though it was p ravenii as my neighbour did some survey work up in far northern new south wales with arthur white and they discovered some frogs up there that looked lots like p ravenii however there distribution currently did not reach into new south wales so it is either p ravenii or p major p bibronii usually have many small red dots over there back like in 
 this is probably going to end up at drv so i wont go on for much longer here lest i repeat myself 
 well when your edit summary is thats a silly and superficial reading at best i agree that you and i have probably reached the end of polite discourse and wouldnt pass muster on a basic middleschool reading comprehension test isnt terribly kind either please dont repeat yourself particularly when you are not being very nice 
 i have to dispute your choice to delete the marcus bachmann article one of wikipedias key principles is and always has been consensus building and yet in the case it seems that clear consensus was ignored in favor of a minority view by my tally N people voted keep as their primary choice in the discussion on afd N had delete as their primary choice and N merge and despite tarcs frequent and uncivil accusations that those voting keep were acting in bad faith and were politically motivated i see many clear concise and logically sound arguments on that discussion for the fact that marcus bachmann fits the guidelines for general notability etc etc so i have to ask why was the article deleted against a vote of nearly N toN in favor of its being kept 
 from 
 i can understand that but while i can certainly see the rationality in aarons rationale for the delete im not entirely sure i agree with the contention that the arguments to keep were not as strong as the arguments to delete or that they did not address the issues raised in the arguments for deletion thats just my opinion though and this seems to be a fairly contentious issue honestly i feel a little sorry for poor aaron hes very obviously done his best to settle this particular battle as impartially as possible and i dont think people would have been happy anything he had decided i have the distinct feeling this is one of those deleted articles that will be sent to drv fought over some more forgotten rediscovered forgotten again sent to arbcom recreated redeleted editwarred over for N months N days and N hours published in print form by a determined supporter buried in peat for three months burned for kindling rewritten and then finally scrapped when everyone realizes that marcus bachmann stopped being relevant like N years earlier aaah politics 
 i like the cut of your jib and i dont even know what a jib is 
 hi i saw that you are going to be working on 
 for some reason i imagined you slighly younger 
 ace 
 sorry aaron if i caused offense but in my defense there are ~N wikipedians and i dont keep track of all their contributions read all of their talk pages or know their reputations doubtful that anyone does im thankful you have contributed to the drv process so that it works as it does but it is equally rude of you to expect that i should have known better i will also argue that i didnt template you as much as cite policy with actual text and talk about why its relevant here if i just cutandpaste drv policy here that would templating 
 argh i didnt mean to imply that you should know as much as thats how i felt so blame me for that misunderstanding but as to the other bit it was totally unnecesary to quote chapterandverse at me just talking like a normal person works again if youd looked just one section above youd have seen that i regularly explain my rationals 
 your closing stated that people supporting to keep the article did not show coverage of marcus independent of his wife although michele is mentioned in these i feel confident in saying that marcus is the main subject and receives indepth coverage given that all of these were in the afd im not sure how these articles failed to address that issue im unconcerned with the number of votes but i am concerned that these articles and their potential to answer the concerns of those supporting to delete the article were not given enough weight 
 im not especially convinced that many editors either on the keep delete or redirect side actually read over those proposed articles since very few commented on them directly so whether they were convinced by them or not seems like a moot point of debate because few discussion points focused on the proposed articles one debate on with what i consider to be a fair justification from silverseren we have a significant amount of information about him outside of his wifes campaign the fact that the campaign instigated this information being published is irrelevant all that matters is the information itself and the fact that he is covered in detail by highly reliable sources i mostly read nonkeep arguments as overextensions of 
 the papers abstract is since i dont have access to the journal except the abstract which doesnt tell the new names i found the names and at zoobankorg you can get alerts when they update their species lists 
 evan if my memory serves me correctly they figured out there were another N species or so species of mixos up in in something like N but didnt describe them until now 
 nope it was mixophyes 
 repeat query i asked im curious why you didnt consider closing it as no consensus which would have been the most accurate summary of the discussion imo you replied if you can be more specific im happy to discuss it more specific its a simple question the basic ways to close a deletion discussion are keep delete merge or no consensus did you consider the possibility of a no consensus close for this discussion thanks 
 response to query well yeah thank you for giving your opinion again id have hoped was that when i asked you to be more specific youd note that yours was by far the shortest question to date and perhaps further note that most of the commentators had taken the time to explain their position so that actual conversations could occur leaving that aside what factors and decisions led to you coming to the opinion that there was no consensus 
 sorry i was taught that brevity is a virtue my opinion was actually a question to you did you consider the no consensus option you have avoided answering that question twice if you avoid it again i will assume you are not going to answer and i will drop it 
 how was the bell frogging where about did you go and what did you see 
 yeah its been bloody freezing down here lately i have never been into the brickpit before as sopa has something against letting us go in there on fats feild trips on some warm nights i have been out to homebush there have just been bell frogs all over the place and once after a fats meeting it was raining and we picked up a bell frog just jumping across the road 
 @calamitybrook was there a question in there 
 now at 
 id like to ask you to reconsider your close as delete on this afd you wrote that several contributors noted that this was not covered in the sources provided as a unified concept while this was asserted these assertions were clearly inaccurate in light of the reliable source citations provided by colonel warden and jclemens that conclusively demonstrate that the list topic is treated as a notable one in multiple independent reliable sources the arguments regarding original research ans synthesis hinge on that point and are equally invalid the final assertion about the material in the article not being covered by the sources raised is flatly wrong i now possess a physical copy of don g smiths hp lovecraft in popular culture and have verified that it covers quite a bit of material from the article taking these things into account i believe the article should be undeleted thanks for your time 
 fine 
 i hope you start sourcing it soon or else it will remain a prime candidate for a future afd this article needs drastic trimming or editing before it is appropriate for an encyclopedia for starters the final product should not aim to be a list of every time a character from the cthulhu mythos has been namedropped or hinted at in another work of fiction it should be a prose summary of the key appearances welldocumented by reliable sources 
 i believe that a rewrite from scratch would be the best option move the existing page to 
 brenneman you old softy im proud of ya 
 ps will try to hunt down some sources as well 
 aw shucks blush there goes my reputation 
 hahaha >_< just what i thought 
 no if you wish to vandalise articles or insult people then it is my responsibility to warn you and report you should it continue uN 
 dont worry not disrespect is taken trying to sort such things out is what we are here for ok heres how i see it keep in mind that space marines live a havery long time i mean abaddon the despoiler is in both the horus heresy series as well as the N k game as the space marine body is so well made it is unknown how long they can actually live for and considering that the black templars are an imperial fists successor chapter it would make perfect sense if helbrecht were once an imperial fists captain so that when the day came that robute guilliman decided to split the legions into chapters rogal dorn could have ordered helbrecht in charge of the black templar chapter thats how i see it anyway again dont worry about angering or offending me talking stuff through like this is the best way to come to a logical conclusion ^_^ uN 
 hmm ok lets firstly discuss the age thing i realise that abaddons slow aging may be the result of the eye of terrors defiance of physical laws but it is a fact that space marines age very slowly if at all im sure it states somewhere in eisenstein that its actually unknown if they do age also remember it does state that garro has been in the death guard legion so long he was there when the emperor first found mortarion on barbarus back then the death guard were called the dusk raiders not to mention the fact that aside from the primarchs qruze is the oldest space marine in the whole horus heresy series (i think that one was explained back in 
 you actually have a very good point ok heres what i will do i will remove the thing i put in the eisenstein article and commend you for your brilliant knowledge of N k if you had an account id probably throw a barnstar at you for you raise havery good points and it looks like you really know your stuff so id say both your knowledge of N k and your ability to discuss and argue it out is great lol as a wikipedian its probably my duty now to urge you to get an account thanks for the discussion ^_^ uN 
 i cant recall which one it was but an old space marine codex mentions that sm live for hundreds of years if not killed i think the oldest known living sm at the moment is dante at about N years or so 
 ooh rogue trader time thats way before my day in N k i dunno if thats been retconned at all but i removed the thing that i put on the eisenstein although i might add something about it being a similar name uN 
 please notify user 
 i have looked at 
 again i respectfully request that you reopen the discussion and let it complete with a more convincing consensus it is not done yet 
 thanks for asking so nicely i will have another look 
 its also obvious to me that part of the issue here was just people being unaware of what was important in a debate like this and chasing sideissues rattnerN for instance would probably be surprised to hear that i felt that he didnt respond well enough but equally samj didnt ask the question clearly enough the debate could have been more productively focused 
 thanks for taking the time to work on this and explaining your thought process the thing is that you are appear to be forgetting that actual work done by me and other members of the community was lost due to people being unaware of what was important in a debate like this it seems that you have not only ignored the opinion of some people in the community because they lack experience but in fact counterreacted to them as if having a weak argument can actually detract the strong points given in favor of notability as i mentioned above i have shown clearly that some of the points given during the discussion were false and my opponent did not reply even the nominator seemed to admit that the company may be a notable one me and other members still believe that the sources do indicate notability and are willing to prove this including improving the article if needed but you have abruptly closed the discussion without letting the discussion run its course people were still actively debating instead of terminating the discussion why not post an explanation to the less experienced participants what is important in a debate like this and then let the discussion continue i for one want to save an article on which i invested a lot of effort and have more to say in this debate this is not the best article on wikipedia but surely not the worst again all i am asking that you allow the community to discuss until the discussion is finished if after that you judge that the consensus is still against the article then i would accept that N N august N 
 thats not an unreasonable request hold on 
 thank you for the invitation to join your project i gladly accept sincerely N N march N 
 ditto however i am mostly a vandalism watcher and general cleanup artist not much good for major article additions 
 i marked 
 legend i knew there was something like that but couldnt recall where 
 look i know that i wasnt suppose to use the talk page as it was a forum and that i wasnt supposed to retaliate you reversing it by reversing your user page but that doesnt change the fact that happy tree friends contains subliminal messaging
 if there is subliminal messaging you need to be 
 get to think of it otoh that does make only limited sense since i couldnt participate in the discussion there unless the page is unprotected which might not be a good idea 
 thaty was quick i was actually looking over the history to see if protection was required good move both on flos part and yours thanks for being so patient with this slightly labourious process 
 thanks and no prob i know that patience is required in all things p and g 
 as you are not a bot you may be interested to know that i have restored 
 read it thanks for the info 
 hi sorry for not responding sooner to you but i have not been regularly participating in wikipedia activities for the past several weeks shame on me though for not explaining my close as it was a fairly contested discussion looking over the discussion the opposition to keeping the article mainly suggested redirecting an afd discussion is not needed for a redirect or merge that discussion can take place on the articles talk page 
 agreed thank for taking the time to follow up 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised removing will stop the 
 thanks for the note 
 perhaps the following links will remind you 
 christ the first is going back a hell of a long way attempt to own articles the second is a statement of fact and mikus is a persistent vandal which if you took the trouble to examine his talk page you would discover 
 regards uN 
 since hes supposedly using an ip to edit from he can be reported and banned because hes using a 
 well although it looks suspiciously like it i cant prove the sockpuppetry thing uN 
 also enough of personal attacks and harassment on wikipedia is enough to warrant a block 
 whatever became of that uN 
 i dont want any more trouble than the guy has already given me but thanks for letting me cry on your shoulder a bit uN 
 dont worry about it after looking through the sockpuppet report archive i noticed that i b wright was either extremely defensive or in denial about his sockpuppetry go to 
 ok i will think about it thanks again uN 
 tragic new developments 
 i call shenanigans i b wright was mentioning overscan and other framerate or resolution topics both as an ip address and loggedin user not to mention all the entries by the ip or user are written in both the same style and tone also such deletions neednt be likened to a personal opinion and just arguing about it will not get very far also what about the user warning template coming from an ip address dont worry about the warnings they have no merit and were not actually reported to anyone 
 i will consider it 
 hi can we please discuss the issue of the taxonomic info i started a 
 my apologies bad day i let things get to me i shouldnt have and i sincerely apologise 
 hi what was the point of deleting that page couldnt the nominee have just declined there thanks and nbsp uN 
 miranda had declined the request and since declined rquests are normally deleted i asked her if she wanted it deleted and she did i can link to the discussion if you wish 
 thanks for the quick response i guess the bigger question is why is it that declined rquests are normally deleted it would seem to me that closing them with links to declinations would be more transparent and nbsp uN 
 well there isnt any point in keeping them around and in the log for mirandas second rfa it will show that i deleted it with a reason for deletion also if the second rfa was closed and it never happened and then mirandas N rd nomination was created later it looks like miranda went through two previous rfas when in reality she had only gone through one 
 hello a featured picture candidate you commented on 
 im not sure what you mean about the tone but i agree with you on the template name i originally used obnoxious meaning essentially the same thing as over the top or overwhelming but i wasnt thinking about how negative the word was which is why i changed the text danielfolsom or 
 based on your name my assumption is that you are a bot is this correct if you are not a bot then you may wish to request a change of username the assumption that you are a bot may be harmful to you 
 my userpage has a little line mentioning that im not a bot and i used to have a blurb on my signature saying that im not a bot (but i found it made for a complicated signature i have had people ask the same question before but still thanks for letting me know 
 i dont have administrative rights here on wikipedia for the time being actually the reason i reverted your edits was because they dont conform with the wikipedia content standards second you cant be an 
 thing is wikipedia isnt 
 we cant make steve jobs page look all shiny just because people like to be him that would conflict with wikipedias intention of having a 
 nice addition nadia well written and much needed 
 it certainly is notable enough in my opinion which i know doesnt count for too much the only thing i could see that it needs to guarantee notability is beefing up with additional references as it only cites icbn some editors think all such articles are nonnotable just for that reason (
 naming references saves the editor from having to enter all the reference details over again each time a reference is reused in the article see for an example in this edit the reference was given a name and then the name was cited a second time further down the page naming references also prevents the same citation from showing up inside the reference list as multiple citations instead if you reuse a citation by its name the article will group it into a single citation with multiple instances this can be seen in the example edits reflist 
 live and learn thanks 
 re please put a little more thought into your tagging also a little more civility in your summaries it is not pleasant for editors to have their work unnecessarily described as weasel words i see you recently had a failed rfa if you ever want to make admin you need to start seriously thinking about the effect your actions have on others back to your edit the meaning here is some conformal coatings are sputter deposited engineering plastics this is hardly weasel words and the tag on some is especially inappropriate as some is not referring to a person or persons 
 apologies the reason i tagged the sentence is because i thought that the word some in that particular phrase was referring to a person or group of persons but as you said it indeed was not that said you are right about what wording i chose for the edit summary it probably was a little over the top for such an edit 
 greetings just so we dont doubletap i reported 
 hi thanks for the notice i was planning to do the same on his next violation 
 better yet if you see more of him you may want to mention it where i have filed yesterday at 
 now blacklisted 
 i dont know how to break it to you gently so let me cut to the chase i regret to inform you that uN 
 i saw the rant from the ip on your page perhaps you might want to head over to 
 thank you for your consideration 
 hi i just commented at 
 please dont revert my edits im editing for the good of wiki im sorry if you think im vandilizing but im working for the good 
 sorry but can you explain the following edits to me and how they are helping wikipedia 
 heckler and koch hkN has not ever been used by suomen armeija so stop adding it to users of that weapon first and only N nato caliber lmg which fdf uses is leopard N tanks mgN only hk weapons fdf uses are mpN submachinegun and hkN aN 
 the source in the article disagrees with you it says that finland does use or has used the hkN your claims are not suitable evidence to the contrary please see 
 false claim in N year old article doesnt proof anything and i dont have to proof anything to you show any other source to your claim bet you cant find any cos there aint any fdf does not nor has ever used hkN ask anyone 
 as much as i have tried to fix some of the siren articles would it be easier to group them into the one page about each manufacturer i just think having a master article for each companys sirens is better than having a bunch of aborted articles about each type some of the articles like the N thunderbolt cyclone N and hurricane articles seem suitable but what to do about the others there isnt much to say about some sirens as the original creators had thought 
 it depends thing is the other sirens may not have enough written 
 you cant simply declare the source to be incorrect based on your own 
 false claim in some N year old web site is not proof of anything and if you ask straight from finnish defence forces or any other source which knows anything you hear that this weapon is not nor has ever been used by fdf 
 @N i dont want to make you look rather silly but the website was started in N not N if you consider it as a N year old website moreover the copyright reads as aremtek N which means that it is renewed and updated on a very regular basis if you think that the website is erroneous in their report you should be the one telling them off not us here 
 co article was first published in the december N edition of small arms review so this article is N years old and the fact is that finnish defence forces has not nor does now use this mentioned weapon no mather what N year old webarticle falsely claims 
 @N please be civil in your interaction with other editors on wikipedia do not use inflammatory tone during you conversation with us fyi the onus is now on you to prove that rogN is wrong since he has already provided a reliable online source for citation in the article page on the other hand you have done nothing constructive here but hurling a lot of abuse in the direction of rogN knock it off~ 
 i have changed your csd tag on 
 acknowledged thanks for the headsup 
 you were a bit early in closing 
 if you didnt know how you should have asked you dont need to be closing rfas there are enough bureaucrats administrators and experienced users watching the page to ensure things are done right 
 former users are included in the users lists in wikipedia gun articles so the age of that particular source is not a problem if anything it only shows that small arms review as a source has been around awhile it cant simply be discredited with an editors 
 please explane to me how can i proof what our army uses or not use these things are so called military secrets but fdf has never claimed to use this weapon not any other N nato caliper lmg and in last N years this claim is only mention of our use of this weapon 
 i am the god proof otherwise 
 @N you have been proven wrong and you are now being 
 despite the wrong sourcing of the anonymous user i think you should put bolivia back in the photos that are uploaded by 
 hi i added bolivia back to the users list the photo you mentioned wont suffice as an actual source because its an anonymous upload so i will include a tag until a suitable source is found for bolivia

 one more question i have reems of notesdrawings test data etc through developent pictures from my testing are used in our advertisingand it is easily verifyable through a phone call to either remington defense or bushmaster 
 since your information hasnt been published by a reliable external source yes it would be considered original research and as such it wouldnt be acceptable for use in the article as for the weapon specifications if yours are correct they are likely supported by at least one reliable external source of some sort

 thank you a lot for your hard work especially on the fn pN and fn fiveseven articles i was very impressed by the writing and organization of each page they are great examples of what wikipedia articles should strive for i look forward to one day seeing these pages as featured articles 
 hi no problem i hope to have both of the articles featured before too long 
 hi you listed 
 hi i left my response on my talk page for continuity 
 are you an admin or sysops here at the wiki there are several articles that require following a correct naming convention can you move the pages to the correct name the correct name for these articles is actually a redirect link to the incorrectly named page just trying to clean up the pages within the project if you can i can provide you a list i posted a note in each of the pages regarding the proposition to move it to the correct page as well 
 hi im not an administrator but i went ahead and moved N mm remington magnum to 
 i have made some opensuggestions on 
 it appears you are right about the alternate layout being inspired by 
 the reason i put the nationality in the pages title is because 
 actually she is a panarab entertainer and just entertainer is much better 
 the article says shes egyptian i wasnt aware that panarab was a nationality but it is still ambiguous because the title nelly could still apply to 
 by the way 
 what a dumb question of course i remember you if you were online more often i would be messaging you too psh do i remember you 
 ah that sucks well i can help a little more with the slc article though personally i think its good enough but its for the other people to decide 
 hi werldwayd id encourage you to add sources as you are writing an articleuN it will make it less likely that someone comes along and tags it for lacking 
 nicely done i have seen you around beforeuN some of our article editing interests overlap it seems please feel free to stop by my talk page anytime if you need assistance best 
 i submitted my N st article from my user page to be reviewed and am not sure about the steps that follow any advise would be appreciated about time frames or short cuts etc thanks you in advance 
 the place to go to is

 i slightly modified the above which you created some of the pages that used it rendered a bit oddly i admit im not a full bottle on templates so i hope i didnt do anything wrong regards 
 thanks for yr message i remember reading some of the books my dad had years and years ago and had forgotten all about them until reading your article good memories 
 haha go to bed 
 greetings your user page hasnt been vandalized it was updated to use the new 
 sorry jon you were listed under both idaho and utah please add or remove whichever you deem appropriate 
 hi werldwayd you create some good articles might you write about the instrumental version of this tune if you could as it was the real theme to world cup N thanks best 
 thanks for doing this have you seen the world cup songs talk page i left you four messages all on themes and anthems best 
 i have put myself up for adminship i figured that you would probably support me to become an administrator the votes are taking place at 
 thanks for the support oh and yes i did notice the utah wikiportal however i havent really been keeping much on an eye on it i can begin keeping track of it and maintaining it however now that you mention it 
 thanks for the review i think i dealt with the issues you left i responded to one or two that i didnt change immediately great to have a review by a past world series fa author 
 hiya i think i have dealt with all your comments sorry to harass like this but you are the only outstanding commenter currently 
 <N <N thanks for that been a long time since i got a fa promoted 
 the program schedule for a tv network is not the same as program schedules for every radio station what encylopedia includes program schedules for each radio station while some radio station articles list programs that is far differnet then having a program schedule 
 using a list makes it look much less like an ad for the station so yes doing it that way would in my opinion be better 
 if images without proper sourcing are placed in articles they will be removed and deleted per the speedy deletion process which does not require notification make sure any images used in articles are clearly source and licensed 
 im restoring the image from a mirror site

 thanks for pointing that out now i have done so 
 hi jon what do you think of the 
 i like that too unfortunately its not showing up on the actual 
 that looks good i have forced the boxes to topalign so that it looks neater do you think we should allow for diversity as in alternate between the two singular formats and the third combined or should we have a standard format across portals this could probably replace which has become both redundant and far too large 
 i will fiddle with the notice back to 
 that could work my original intent was to arrange like categories grandparent portal parent portal and children parent portals would be shown on the the granparent and the children on the parent portals for geography this would mean showing regional portals on 
 yep i got your source unfortunately that was a propaganda piece i searched the whole net to see if i could get any material about the tombs at saffron monastery unfortunate that their aint any it would be better not to use that particular line since we do not have any authentic source the particular source was in reply to another author who went and saw the tomb of iganatius abdul masih at the saffron monastery since we have a conflict we should enquire more it was put in wiki for almost an year 
 after the concerns you have raised about the reliability of that source i have removed the note about the burial there are so many contentious issues about this iganatius abdul masih we need to be very careful in portraying certain contentious details 
 thanks a lot for your prompt action i did search the whole net for a genuine source unfortunately there aint even one however i have some contacts who belong to the region will have to mail them and see if they know anything more thanks a lot 
 if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of 
 i have declined my own speedy now that i can see that that article subject is actually notable thank you for your help 
 regarding of yours is thumb really the best option we have it throws off the centering of the image in the infobox and creates yet another box around the image 
 personally i think the ideal solution would probably be what infobox actor used to use before edit changed it that set the image size to what the account had set for the default for the image by using an frameless image so if someone has their default size set larger due to say having a nice widescreen monitor then the image will appear at a decent size and not look like a postage stamp that in part is why the manual of style discourages setting images to a fixed size only reason why i havent arbitrarily dropped that bunch of code into female adult bio is that it changes the image format by removing the 
 sounds like a perfect job for a 
 hmm good idea 
 besides to answer your question on 
 cool yes 
 of interest 
 yup thanks for the headsup 
 to set the record straight actually i did not create this article at all as i know about the controversy surrounding it as it has not charted yet i was just adding some cosmetic very small edits on an already existing text the article was created by 
 you can do what you want just follow the requirements of the license 
 heh id say that works i trust you have also been in touch with the wipo arbitration and mediation center to win back the domain name 
 all i can say is cut the guy off at the source you should contact the folks at twitter and facebook and point out that the account in question is fraudulently infringing on linsey and that you would like them to hand the accounts over you might need to give them proof that you are speaking on linseys behalf see page for contact information for twitter and for facebook but if i were you id try and contact someone directly at those two places via phone or fax as a live person will likely be more responsive and i trust you have initiated wipo actions for the url 
 thanks for the notification of the tfd much appreciated also whilst im here could you revert image back to the school logo thanks

 wikipedias blp policy trumps ownership accusations in this instance 
 please note this edit the editor made it without discussion thanks 
 what you have said on my page is pretty much not true i havent got time for it now but lets discuss on the talk page i want to avoid mediation but i will go for that if we cannot get consensus thanks 
 hey there i hope that you didnt take any offence to my reversion of your edits on 
 no problem at all mate its an aspect that seems to be neglected from the articles for some reason or another the major covers anyways the article hasnt really been developed for a while so its nice to see somebody paying attention to it again

 follow my contribs or look at 
 what are you referring to 
 currently the article only exists on your userpage did you follow the steps i mentioned earlier (
 hi 
 max liron( 
 thank you thats whats needed 
 hi now that 
 thanks much sorry i didnt realize youd already been working on it most people are unaware of dablinks so i leave notes to make them aware of it thanks again 
 i wasnt previously familiar with the tag so thank you for bringing it to my attention that would probably constitute a better method of future operation with regard to such matters nevertheless the information i deleted from that article was all information which was reasonably subject to being deleted and i stand by my contention that 
 put my feedback on the talk page for the article 
 hey i noticed that the 
 bit of a challenge as theres been so many changes to boundaries for instance the electorate of swan which i believe was first held by forrest used to be pretty much the entire south west of the state and now is an inner urban electorate so it had a decidedly conservative history but has been held by labor more years than not in the last N years the central 
 but in terms of the simple question of one party regardless of changing boundaries there are no more the last two looked promising until i realised they had independents p 
 oh and lulz @ buswell hes emphatically ruled out any merger with the nats in this state d 
 i dont think buswell will get a say p either way there will be pain ahead merger or not if they merge they can kiss goodbye a few of the national electorates that will fall to labor simply out of not wanting to be a part of the new liberal party i also have trouble thinking what theyd call themselves that does not give superiority to one party which they have said is a prerequisite they cant use country for a major party national has 
 my guess would be conservative party of australia i know some in the movement favour this 
 cpa menzies would be rolling in his grave p 
 hi err i didnt edit that page an never have i think you must of got the wrong person
 well your ip address was used to make edit so it seems rather clear 
 read 
 i was looking at a photo album i have with pic of pedro and me and i wanted to show the ravages of aids on person so young i thought it might be educational and moving 
 its easy to see the version you wrote just click on the history tab for the article 
 heh that photo of david you found that i uploaded i took that one myself live in concert great show 
 tabercil can the article be unsalted on that basis alone or does it still have to go to a deletion review 
 hmm theres an article at 
 hey long time no speak im going to change the video link here as not all countries have the vevo link per copyright reasons the video link from you tube im putting in is the actual video 
 ps please check my previous edits and fix this to that if you will thanks again best 
 is there a wikipedia guideline on creating a wikipedia article just for the sake of having a citation to use in another wikipedia article timothy N seems to have done this with 
 yes it needs to go up for speedy deletion but with the info saved elsewhere imho no citations context is wrong good info but not in right place 
 this awas after i deleted and protected against recreation 
 this is due to the page getting an increased amount of hits the person in regards debut film is getting released at the end of the week and as he is a starson debutant the curiousity factor is sky high 
 hmm we have admins working to crosspurposes here and you had asked to rewrite the article as best as i can tell theres no significant difference between what the article looked like when it about to be deleted and what there was when you restored it so the original problems with it still remain in my opinion 
 on second thought i think itd be best for the community to decide i will undelete it and let nature take its course 
 the primary issue is to simply make sure that the article makes a strong enough argument that he is notable once 
 sourced mentions always helps but the key item is what wpbio says is needed he or she has been the subject of published secondary source material which is reliable intellectually independent and independent of the subject what you need to do is to find thirdparty articles on mr glasscock and work from them for instance did he do any interviews in newspapers about himself 
 im still not quite sure if he is notable its not terribly evident the prod i put on it unsurprisingly got reverted by the pages creator and im not quite ready to afd it 
 its so awful can you think of anything better thats pd for the stub template 
 oh lordy it is rather poor quality you are talking about 
 hey i am walking out the door right now and dont have time to fix this could you check in to it thanks 
 offhand id say it looks right im about to do the same myself but from a quick look it does look renee diaz is a pseudonym for renee perez 
 is it just me or is it a copy and paste move shouldnt that be addressed 
 im looking into the copyright allegations against the main article and im starting to agree with hw that the history is such a tangled mess that it will be somewhere between difficult and impossible to clean up i basically accept the notability of the subject so im trying to find a clean starting point do you feel confident that your version represents a clean start or did you start with the existing version and cut down and mdash 
 no problem if the article survives afd i will replace it with your new rewrite and delete the history and mdash 
 i hope that we can remove the dispute form on the sunny leone wiki page it has been over N months and its just the two of us against sikh history with no input from anyone else recomend that the addition of religion be deleted as it is not neutral lets close the chapter as it is dragging on even though the other party refuses to admit it 
 two of us against sikhhistory is that how you view wikipedia might is right i really try and assume good faith at all times but this really is too much unlike yourself i am trying to get clarity on this article without 
 users may edit the article during the discussion including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion however do not remove the articlefordeletion template from the top of the article 
 thanks for leaving a message about the notability of rehan khan i have now reworked the article and added many references that clarify notability of this artist during and after fame x win please refer to my note also on 
 i cant edit the asia topic page but the nagorno karabakh code needs redoing to match the europe coding so it will point to the country not the region 
 i dont have much of an opinion either way but why did you change the main photo its more recent but the older one had her looking directly at the camera 
 exactly as you said its newer 
 is there some policy that states the newest picture has to be used im not crazy about the either but theres only a oneyear difference between the two and the first one was more professional looking 
 hmmm what we have in the article right now are essentially two pictures of diablo at tiff N i will move the pic i added down and restore the original image just to provide some variety 
 we need to be able to verify that the pictures are properly licensed at the source and that the source has the rights to place that image under the license chosen for instance i could in theory put the star wars movie up on a website and say i herby place this in the public domain but i dont hold the copyright on the movie so i dont have the right to do that 
 hi tabercil i dont know if you are aware of the big hullabaloo over at 
 more after libeling these reliable sources he now calls the subject herself a liar his routine has officially jumped the shark as far as im concerned hope you or another rational entity will look in cheers 
 well we have a saying in porn valley whores lie generalised people lie yes we can be skeptical of dead whores too but really just because someone is obstinate in demanding verification does not mean you should start insulting him by calling him a selfimportant jackass 
 selfimportant jackass thats peanuts by extension you have just called him a lying whore i believe 
 well offhand id say the sources look good 
 thanks for the input you too morbid 
 if you created the article please dont take offense instead consider improving the article for help on inserting references see 
 thank you for adding references to the article on rola saad cheers 
 thank you for your help 
 looks good in cases where the image is in the

 i was glad to see that you made a few of us have been completely distracted with removing such additions based on factual inaccuracy 
 as i said the artists signing the petition is not notable for their own article imo it would be notable for the polanski article if you feel the attacks are too persistent drop me a line about it or drop a notice on the admins noticeboard asking for some page protection 
 its died down for now i left an only warning template for the personal attacks due to the severity of it and have gotten no reply thanks though i will keep it in mind

 thanks for help one more question similar item at this address is a painting http or or sflibN sfplorgN or recordbN ~sN do i use the same tags 
 yep same tags if you are able try uploading it on commons i think you can login with the same username or password in the licensing option select public domain first published in the us before N let me know if you encounter any problems 
 great thanks 
 you should be an admin quite soon 
 im rubbing my hands together like a cartoon villain d uN 
 would this be an accurate characterisation congratulations 
 exactly thank you black falcon for your support even while recognizing how frequently wrong i am p now when are you going to apply for adminship uN 
 there have been a couple of cases where i think i have been wrong i guess my several attempts to tackle portions of

 thanks glenn 
 ah so i see i will take a browse through and see what you added and how theyd fit in with the article and im not really a fan of her specifically more like someone who cares to make sure the porn stars are properly looked after on wikipedia (hint see

 well looking over the article im having to agree with the nomination at this point shes not what id call notable just because the article gets deleted doesnt mean its permanently deleted we have created articles on porn stars that were once deleted but since we found to be notable (eg 
 im not really involved into season articles but as far as i know the opponents goalscorers are not usually listed you can check yourself at 
 well i know you have done a lot of work but articles of the same kind are supposed to be consistent thats why we have wikiprojects and the manuals of style they set standards based on consesus which editors are expected to follow if you dont agree about something you can discuss the matter on the wikiproject talk page and propose a change uN

 the question is is this information noteworthy i fear not and it could also mislead the reader the information about jacques moving here and there can be covered in the article 
 in my opinion it should be because in most articles about civilian persons descents and expatriate countries are covered so that shoudl apply to sportspeople as well if somebody bothers to add it 
 im not sure its noteworthy at all especially since where these people lived isnt actually relevant to anything and has no bearing on what they did in life racing drivers live in many different countries throughout their lives and categorising them based on where they lived parttime for a couple of years here and there seems pointless moreover very little of this stuff is mentioned in the articles themselves particularly all these guys who may or may not have lived in monaco at some point therefore the categories are misleading i think a consensus should either be produced or established 
 i agree with you bretonbanquet maybe this should be taken to the motorsport project for further discussion 
 done 
 and it can be found 
 i dont know if you have all the playmate articles on your watchlist so excuse me if you have seen this already 
 thanks 
 actually i think it was more on the unsourced blp grounds that he deleted them in any case i think deleting was a definite overreach and have restored them 
 thanks he seems to have copy or pasted his attack page comment so your hypothesis is possible would it be easier for you to resurrect the talk pages as well or just put all the tags back from scratch 
 ooops i will fix but this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the problem given the comments found 
 i guess i will have to start devoting some time every week to going through wekinglypigscom and my back issues to source the playmate articles with over N that could take some real time 
 yah what im planning on doing is pick up a book on diy 
 i think it might be time to revive this idea in respect to new articles given the increasing number of unreferenced new articles and the relative success of the blp prod experiment and incorporating ideas from that sparked by recent thread at ani about backlogs 
 how would you propose to do so without encountering the objections encountered the last time around 
 i have only skimmed the old proposal so im not sure how closely my suggestions equates to whats there but i hope that times have changed enough in the last three years that it will get a better hearing you probably have a better idea of where to launch such a discussion than i do village pump perhaps

 hi there i have recently tweaked the main 
 ah ok and where did you get the descriptions of each season from or did you write them yourself based on the clubs main article keep up the great work 
 frankly i have got those from my own memories since i followed serie a closely in those years its not very complicated you just need to briefly sum up the season and mark out if theres been any outstanding players 
 as you are uptodate on bringing articles to afd debate please consider nominating 
 umm softwares a lil outside of my area of focus i will pass 
 while im thinking about it could you check the permissions at 
 looked good only change i made was to state that there was no known free use image thus that allows for future changes such as one being located 
 i used the same permissions and licensing on three other images and another editor put them up for deletion discussions i dont understand how one person can say the images are fine and another put them up for deletion this is why i stopped uploading images for a long time i cant seem to get one to stick without some sort of problem could you tell me whats wrong with them so that i can fix it the images are 
 welcome to the semianarchy thats wikipedia i have chimed in and it seems like jhealds made some decent arguments already i will keep an eye on the debate 
 i know its here but it still annoys me from time to time especially when i try to upload an image thanks 
 i still think that you need to read 
 if his only link with spain is at possibly some centuries distance like most argentinians that strikes me as too tenuous a link to be a valuable categorisation nevertheless having a surname associated with a particular nation isnt a reliable published source for his being of that descent as to naturalisation if he is indeed a naturalised citizen of italy there should be no difficulty finding a areliable published source to confirm it cheers 
 italian wikipedia is indeed listing zxeN rate as an italian citizen and heres an article in italian suggesting that zxeN rate would consider playing for the italian national team having received his italian passport in N cheers 
 thanks 
 i deleted the picture because it does not add to the article there already is a portrait photo of her there is a link to wikimedia commons for other photos and thats where your photo belongs if this were a longer more detailed article and your photo dealt with a specific issue in the article it would be acceptable otherwise it is just eye candy and doesnt aid in explaining anything in the article not a bad photo though 
 you can add me to your flickr list if you want i seem to run into politically famous or or infamous people all the time around toronto and sometimes in nova scotia the address is http or or wwwflickrcom or photos or joebenbram or 
 did you ever read 
 hello have you read it how do you think all your categories pass this guideline 
 i have read it and i dont think they are irrelevant whatsoever most categories im involved in means just filling out on previous categorizations and the ones i start are related to already existing categories for other nationalities especially when it comes to 
 it has nothing to do with football nothing you have made no attempt to prove if any of these guys actually lived in the us if they did how long do they have to live there before you include them your rationale is completely and utterly arbitrary and has no place in an encyclopedia 
 you as an administrator should in my opinion not use such ludicrous words but its not my call but its fine if you delete the category i have other projects that interest me more anyway best wishes 
 why do you think i am an administrator ludicrous words like what 
 because you marked the category for deletion i have never seen that banner for a normal user but sorry mate it was more about the entire sentence calling my rationale completely and utterly arbritrary and therefore they have no place in an uncyclopedia as the most active motor racing writer ever on swedish wikipedia i find it hard to have my judgement being brassed off like that 
 anyone can do that anyway your rationale is arbitrary because you have made no attempt to verify how long a driver spent in the us whether he had a home there or just visited for races and there is no cutoff point for inclusion specifically how long does someone have to live there before he is included nobody knows you even included beretta who took part in one nascar race one he probably spent a week there maybe nobody questions your edits on the swedish wikipedia but we all edit in the knowledge that we are here to be criticised if someone thinks it appropriate 
 what criteria taking part in a usbased racing series what part of that isnt already covered by 
 i got to agree with bretonbanquet your time would be better spent adding to articles rather than add more categories 
 please see 
 im aware of it if you check the discussion which prompted it (
 the image you have provided does not have any form of permission statement provided to back up the license as such we cannot make use of it now i have since cropped the other image to remove the nudity and have used that edited version and as for her wishes its fine and we acknowledge them but its not about to be deleted 
 there was no reason to revert my edit especially as it was correct 
 have not looked at it again but im quite sure it was wrong or at least incomplete it is mentioned clearly that the results of the last team are not counted in this ranking im guessing you did add them or forgot to add the results against a another team if however i did make a mistake then sorry 
 as for nudity personally i try to select images that avoid it if we can help it if need be i will crop the image down but we do have images that have been submitted by the users that do have nudity 
 coelacan would you have a look at 
 im looking into it five six minutes and i will have a response uN 
 it was just reversion of vandalism dont touch the page again for a little bit has this ip been reported to aiv yet if not let me do it uN 
 i reported to aiv but included a mention of the N rr accusation against me so the reviewing admin could take it into consideration N other uses have now also reverted him so im not too worried 
 i see that you have again added the picture of the topless model to the article on eileen daly do you have a personal grudge against this lady 
 take another look the version that i put up is the cropped version and i do wish to point out a policy on wikipedia 
 thanks for all your work in adding those images uN 
 thank you but im nowhere near done i still have a ton of photos to upload from the flickr account of subactive_photo then i have another chap whos agreed to contribute photos of it as well he was at a different location in the stadium so its a different perspective but when all is said and done we should have a very good resource to draw upon 
 hi mate what i have added in terms of australian sportspeople of italian descent are the sportspeople already registered as of italian descent like bresciano grella patrizi and other deadcerts also i cant think of any male people of say english descent voluntarily changing their surnames to italian ones especially considering the way people looked down on the italians in australia back in the N s or am i wrong not that it matter anyway 
 we are going to have to erase anything you have added that you think is correct whether its a deadcert or not get the evidence then add it 
 this is at least the second time that your assumptions have been used to overcategorize articles we cannot add categories to biographies based solely on your assumptions and a selfcreated criteria please concentrate on adding information to articles in text rather than adding categories you seem to lack a fundamental understanding of the categorisation guidelines and therefore should not be adding so many categories to so many articles 
 additionally anyone you have list in a sportspeople category and also have list in the people category it is a subcat of remove from one of them if people are listed in both it completely removes the point of having a subcategory 
 you appear to still be at this despite people asking you not to 
 and im asking you not to bother argentine expatriate sportspeople is not an irrelevant category basta 
 except your inclusion of people in the category is based solely on your guesswork which is not how wikipedia works so you can ask but no you will be bothered if you continue to attempt to classify people in categories without any criterion or consensus on the matter 
 if a football or ice hockey or basketball or handball player plays for a club in a country its N per cent that he lives there too at least during the seasons if you think anything else i reckon you are just plain dumb you are not living in buenos aires while playing for milan could you give me an example of any football player not living in the country where he plays his trade at the moment any no you cant 
 you appear to grossly misunderstand wikipedia criteria the burden of proof lies with you as you are adding the information you cannot simply say that every player must live in this country simply because it makes sense to you 
 so according to you i have to break into 
 the answer to your question is contained in 
 im more than certain that references for ronaldo obama and schumachers residences exist and in fact do exist on their respective articles however your assumption of all players who play for a team must live in that same country is not remotely similar to a reference it is an assumption created by you and easily falls under original research you have no clear criteria or evidence for what is considered living in a country 
 the dispute seems to have ended three years ago and this stub has been semi protected indefinitely for over three years now dispute seems to have ended discussion page hasnt even been edited in about a year it seems it is time for this article to be unprotected 
 well its more like N + years ago but you are right lets see what happens if its unprotected though if you are looking for it to be unprotected just to restart the blp issues you are probably gonna get blocked for a nice long time 
 actually no the one who put the semi protection down a notch said that the blp issues are done and if the do restart i didnt mean it 
 a key feature of brainstorming is that you do not stop to evaluate ideas i suggest that folks make suggestions i suggest you take on board everyones suggestions i do not suggest that you sit idly by and let folks yammer ceaselessly about the various drawbacks or benefits real or perceived about their suggestions and everyone elses too iron rule #N of wikipedia yammering happens yammering is also unproductive mattisse whatever comes out of this process needs to have your fingerprints all over it it needs to be your decision you should not be passively guided by others you need to exert a guiding influence so take all the suggestions that you want but then you make the decisions not others 
 the actual proposal will be shaped here 
 one of the references was to a site called littleoralannieonlinecom and apparently owned by vcx the studio that released most of her films it is as reliable a source as one can find for a N s era porn star its not as if whos who had listings for porn stars please reinstate it thank you 
 sorry its not a reliable source at all the presense of advertising by vcx does not mean that the host site is reliable in fact a quick check at the whois listing at the registrar reveals the website is owned by incoming america llc 
 are you able to locate a source that meets your standards 
 i have not looked but the onus is not on me with regards to sourcing from 
 the thing is you deleted all of the references including one to lukeisbackcom luke ford is one of the two most reliable historians of porn if you are going to delete references please do so carefully looking at each reference 
 the wikipedia consensus reinforced by no less than jimbo wales is that fords work fails 
 bill probably would count as a decent source as hes been stated as being a porn historian by several reliable sources including avn luke ford proper is a blogger and a gossip as hullaballoo points out he doesnt really count as a source now the new owner of lukeisbackcom is a different person altogether and her stuff i would be count as being reliable 
 nothing cindi or bill 
 you are right of course especially regarding living people for folks who have moved on it may be a different story and would have to be tackled if or when it arises 
 that was fast thank you 
 replied on the users talk page 
 like this nothing changes for internet explorer users but users of other browsers no longer suffer from this internet explorer fix 
 with regard to the font list in i dont think dejavu sans should precede microsoft sans serif and lucida grande since it is less complete 
 i dont know about the display on msie msies inability to correctly choose an appropriate font is well known though what i didnt know before is that firefox falls back to a buggy font 
 please do any testing on as you please and then copy the code to i cannot do this on my own because i am no administrator it would be great if the display of hebrew text were no longer as inconsistent as it currently is 
 if you do not feel comfortable about creating a template transclusion i can ask kwami to do it i hope you have no objections at the proposed change it is really an improvement because it makes use the same fonts as so hebrew text is no longer displayed inconsistently 
 it looks like there is progress on the firefox jonathan kew has taken an interest in it i have tried creating a patch i have proposed the following three fonts as new default fallback fonts for hebrew text lucida grande times new roman and courier new do you think these fonts are ok 
 could you use your admin powers to look at the article for 
 nope you caught it all 
 thanks i just moved that article into article space only N years to go 
 all i have left for the playmates of N are 
 done they are now 
 me too 
 we both reverted it at the same time please use the sandbox which i linked you to to perform further tests 
 as for the redheaded image i will assume good faith on the part of the photographer but his flickr account is readily findable http or or wwwflickrcom or photos or derable the image of her in profile is also readily findable http or or wwwflickrcom or photos or derable or N furthermore there are additional image there of eileen such as http or or wwwflickrcom or photos or derable or N or and http or or wwwflickrcom or photos or derable or N when i compare those last two images to the ones on eileens own myspace page i do believe that it is indeed eileen who is pictured on the flickr account as i stated earlier i honestly did not see that the image of eileen i got from the flickr account had any nudity 
 the image in question is from before N the photographer says is dates to N 
 that one image is used as its the one image which we currently have that is licensed for use on wikipedia there are currently no other images period that we can use as for the other images on flickr none of them have wikipediafriendly licenses is a list of all such images if you take a look there are but two images the one of eileen daly that we are arguing over and someone who clearly not eileen daly the actress given that situation the choices are clear and i am currently attempting to confirm through the photographer about the id of the person in the picture 
 i have reviewed the contributions in question and concluded the same as sarah speculation on real world information about wikipedians is considered to be 
 gday orederinchaos i have never intended to intimidate or harass anyone on wikipedia and if i have then i apologise i have seen your contributions on other sydney suburb articles over the last couple of years and you may have noticed mine if you have you would have noticed that my contributions have always been positive and have spent a lot of time and effort trying to remove vanddalism from so many articles i have been particularly frustrated by the constant reverts and deleted contributions from all other editors on that particular article as i said no offence or harassment was ever intended and i regret this situation getting out of hand cheers 
 see the answer above 
 thanks for the quick response and fix its so nice to see new editors making useful contributions for example 
 the article 
 fair enough you have pointed out a lot and it gives me a target towards which i can work 
 since you are an admin on commons as well i just thought id ask you about is it just me or does it seem a little odd that the photographer would take this picture print or develop it and then get it signed it doesnt exactly seem like an N xN that a feature dancer would sign and hand out at a club but at the same time the alternative seems a bit strange to me or am i just paranoid 
 yknow if i saw this id be thinking it was a polaroid that gianna had signed as it stands theres a tag on it that calls for more information and the other image this guy uploaded to commons i just trashed as a copyvio from wenn in all likelihood im gonna say his gianna pic will be deleted in N days so itd be best to switch images back 
 its gone now so i cant remind myself of what it looked like but i thought the photo quality a bit too good to be a polaroid it didnt have that characteristic blown flash look to it that i have come so accustomed to with polaroids well its gone now no point in dwelling thanks 
 nah i dont think it was cleared away as it specifically was a copyvio the uploader kept trying to put up that shyla stylez image which i was able to prove was a copyvio after they were blocked for essentially repeated stupidty i imagine the other images said user had uploaded were deleted as a precautionary move 
 why did you change diacritics in the coaches section of the red star article there is not a single reason to that also almost entire talk page is dedicated to the fact that some people think the name of the article should be red star while others support the name crvena zvezda and now you come and solve the problem immediately thats simply the wrong way to do that also your opinion is nobodys business here so get back the info you have removed if this is an encyclopedia than it should be informative whether you like the informations it gives or not vitriden N N july N 
 it was a mistake lost some diacritics when editing in notepad fixed changed article it to follow conventions than every other international football club has as well as the name that trying to 
 ok so what do you suggest are you ok with the article is now im not trying to force anything i just felt by looking at article it was not the same level of quality and consistancy as other international football club articles i would like to work together since it seems you might feel the same way 
 hi i have reverted your revert there because i dont think the edit was vandalism i considered whacking rollback myself but the information was quite negative for a blp my inclination is to leave it as the ip left it and then i will try and merge the entire criticism section into the body thus removing the problem though id appreciate your input 
 well there were two paragraphs that got knocked out by the ip and its the second thats the reason i reverted the one about jonathan shalit is pretty close to an attack statement and if you want to deepsix it i wont spend much time mourning it but the second one especially with the being diplomatic was not in her nature comment i think is quite useful as it gives genuine insight into charlottes nature 
 this pornstar may be notable as per sentence three because of her unique website about getting into or out of porn if you feel differently please send this to 
 im not sure but i have a feeling that the main contributor to this article may be its subject as well you dont see too many women putting up articles about pornstars unless they are 
 i pretty much confirmed the previous coi post however i still feel she may be notable 
 well as you suggested on the articles talk page its now up for afd 
 i did not like that she is editting the article also as the anonymous ip when the anon ip made its nonneutral diatribe on the article talkpage it forgot to mention the elephant in the room ie coi edits have create a selfserving interest to have an article on wikipedia 
 looks like you made a good call 
 wow i didnt know you were an admin i try not to look a gift horse in the mouth or to slap it either ponies have a way of biting if they so desired to tell you the truth i am really sorry now that i declined the prod still the afd showed

 i appreciate that you are keeping an open mind about the issue i have also noticed a similar reverse tendency from several of the editors there but never attempted to document it before in order to avoid conflicts of a personal nature although i think my politeness and shying away from conflict at the time only made things worse especially towards users who were clearly intent on ripping me to shreds nowadays though i dont really have much of a problem with getting a bit personal which is obvious from my recent notsopolite comments i can look into it though documenting it would take quite some time my detractors were documenting evidence against me for months before they finally presented an rfc and thats just against one user to do so for several users would be quite a task to undertake im sure we can gather enough evidence but it just might take some time as for my recent edits they are almost entirely dedicated to the entertainment industry so theres no need to bother with them regards 
 yes we all need other interests thats for sure well if the little bit i have seen is any indication there are serious credibility problems among some in the other camp and worse in others of course there are also some who are in my estimation beyond reproach since it seems they are gearing up for a big push i would appreciate it if you would let me know if you happen to notice any problems with any material they add or change that is of course if they ever actually get around to adding or changing any content they seem for the most part content to take it down take care 
 if you have an agenda and or or an issue with adult entertainment and those who are notable and who work very hard to better the industry deal with it offline in your biased mind not online 
 look to your own talk page for my reply on this 
 you clearly do have an agenda and are biased in your edits so laugh all you like and submit as many references as you like that you are neutral however N people who are adult entertainment professionals as of current will be sending in a few letters of complaint and concern in regards to what you are doing i know i will be monitoring to see who else you target for deletionshould be interesting considering how quickly you targeted myself and priya rai i wonder which adult industry professional with a brown or darker complexion will be next the trend is clear 
 huh i have not said word one at the 
 i was actually going to try to make it work in knoppix do you know if that works 
 i signed up knowing it would be interesting to try to use linux i will let you know what happens when i try it later today 
 i downloaded the dvd release of knoppix N and have been running it i havent been able to get dhcp enabled in knoppix so i doubt anything is going to be happening soon for me very soon can you suggest any other linux distros that might not have that issue im really a linux nub 
 sounds like maybe your nic isnt supported if you want to actually install a distro on your system give 
 seems castillo was not signed but is on loan for N months i too was sceptical at first since i didnt see it in the news but just found an article that confirms it on 
 i really dont care what will happen to the page as long as there is a consensus okay if you have the info that there are other domains considered for montenegro thats fine by me but as far as i can see on 
 cyde you do what you think is best you smell blood so you are going to act accordingly is there anything more we have to discuss 
 mongo your latest spree of edits is really starting to worry me are you becoming unhinged you are lashing out and being uncivil against lots of good people who are merely trying to warn you against blocking people you are in a content dispute with and stop misusing the word vandalism vandalism is clearly defined at 
 look if they are adding and then readding against concensus and in violation of policy unproven nonsense then there is little else it can be referred to as than vandalism 
 can you provide some diffs of this vandalism then if it is so clearcut 
 these two were the basis for his block on pokipsyN personally id question whether they were even nonneutral pov much less vandalism certainly not blockable offenses even if mongo hadnt been in a content dispute with him 
 lets say i used the wrong terminology to describe the reason for the block on pokipskyN in my edit summary or rationale do you dispute from comments made by myself and others and the diffs provided on my rfc that there was no grounds for my block looking over pokipskyN s editing history i dont agree he should be permananently blocked as at least one editor has advocated interesting that you think the N minute block on me for doing nothing wrong was okay and my block of someone else that i and others have provided adequate links about demonstrating edit warring demonstrating pov pushing and demonstrating little or no effort to utilize the talk page on the 
 greetings i went through this page and added diacritics but since i dont know serbian much of what i did was really an educated guess would you mind checking and correcting my work thank you very much 
 thank you and ndash much appreciated 
 i reverted an editor who wrote about health care on the 
 i dont mind the brief mention that theres a hospital or clinic in the community its written in a much better tone than what i edited 
 but thats just a personal opinion anyway 
 the stars of our national team play in leading european clubs and domestic teams often have to compensate with foreigners though im happy to say they have began to rely more on the academies in recent years and this has had a good effect 
 also would you happen to know anything about 
 i also went ahead and moved the article to 
 hi j spencer i have been uploading some images for quite some time now and it are quite a lot of them now i showed you some of my images like the one of the 
 seeing the issue at deltas page and your claim it is in the pd i did an google image search and affirmed there is actually an artist henri le monnier that is affirmed for this image and that it was created in N i am trying to find the year of his death but there are works still attributed to him as late as N so i dont believe you can call that image pd 
 i have replied on my talk page so you know 
 also looking at the discussion on deltas talk page i think you need to brush up on the nfcc a little you seem to be somewhat out of touch with policy or practice 
 well i would call it clean up work after the removal of the clause from porn bio it is very clear to me that there is many not notable stubs about playmates i see no reason to keep them all imo they make good lists nominating uncited stub that the reason for notability has been removed is not a gross violation of anything after four or five years a one or two line uncited stub with no assertion of notability or only cited to playboy is the gross violation 
 is there a board where we can discuss all these 
 offhand 
 i will consider it another editor who recently 
 thank you for your kind words on my 
 we learn so much about local history from inquiries like yours i will get your questions to ann when i send her the link for the stephen william shaw page im starting to post now its taken us over a year to do all the researches for this page and i know we will all be excited when its done thank you for putting the shaw house photo on that group page i hope to get a photo for every landmark up here 
 ann says she can get onto the ferndale museum website and order the two seth kinman booksuN manuscript and yarns then she will know pretty much all there is to know about seth it has detailed clippings and a detailed chronology how did he get along with the indians a matter of opinion and interpretation why didnt he make a chair for grant rob has a theory but who can prove it im trying to encourage her to become wikieditor because she says she has things to fix in shaw and of course that was my secret plan put up some pages about stuff shes expert in and dangle the you can edit bright shiny object in front of her we will see i know shes have a bit of trouble adapting to electronic books and the ability to google up the past from home after N decades of paper and ink scholarship another thing i noticed today his picture of sutter is a mirror image of a N or N plate daguerrotype shown on sutters page but its reversed N or N plate is only about N x N inches and the painting is N inches in size uN and reversed uN so some kind of projection mirroring or light trick may have been used to create the base lines on which shaw painted i am going to try to find other images to see if he did this consistently and i also just found out yesterday his brother seth was an expert daguerotypist part of the panorama of california team and part of at least two studios in san francisco before coming to humboldt the joys of poking in the past 
 i found this photo today do not know if you knew it was in wiki 
 standing here with the gent who transcribed the seth kinman manuscript and tales he says everything you want to know is in those books now heres some goodies probably more than N buckskin suits N we know of wife maria sharpless building bar is now private home on table bluff we can get you an outside photo why grant didnt get a chair grant was opposed to blood sports and therefore mr kinmans interests and those of mr grant did not coincide hes buried in table bluff cemetery to the east side of highway N outside of loleta and he says all the rest of what you want to know is in the book and you will rewriting your entire page after you get it he says prepare to be blown away 
 but thats indeed how its spelled on the list 
 it is serbian strength movementbogoljub kariuN 
 and heres a lil experiment i just ran hit google news and did a search there for current news reports on 
 it seems like the overriding or repetive comment is this is why playboy playmates are considered notable so wikipedians dont have to go through this process what a pain in the butt to have so many afds i have had proctologists with fat fingers who felt way better and were necessary for annual physicals this feels like the old question would you rather be the pin or the pin cushion and having your butt buddy decide hes going to have you bend over 
 hmm when you mention it it might be worthwhile to kind of consolidate all the arguments for general playmate notability into one spot as an essay that way in the future we can just point to it 
 without probing your painful analogies morenooso by wps own criteria and even based on the arguments of many of the delete votes playmates are notable and should have standalone articles most the delete votes say that these articles should be moved to a list well what does 
 read down in that same paragraph the one exception is for list articles that are created explicitly because the listed items do not warrant independent articles for example 
 ah good old wikinonsense every item in a list must have its own article unless it doesnt now i remember why the only two policies i pay attention to are iar and hottie thanks for the clarification 
 this needs to go the board im trying to save a disney cd and the afds are piling up faster than i can type i gotta run but death by buggery would be better than all these afds 
 wait hold the presses i just realized that the ititials afd also stand for something else a$$ f death 
 now im unavoidably going offline for the next few days 
 well this might be as good a time and place as any to bring up the problem i have with project p its main purpose seems to be to identify what to exclude and then go around deleting stuff maybe a few guidelines on whether to use a dash or a hyphen but other than that what why not actually organize the members to ah work on the subject a threat to ones area of interest would seem a golden oppurtunity to organize the troops and get to work dismas is doing a great job but hes just one guy and its a huge project why not make up a list of the lists that need to be done and ask the members of the project to pick ones to work on im not a member of the project anymore but id certainly be willing to chip in on a year or two i will look in this weekend and see what i can do but in the meantime a note to the troops wouldnt be a bad idea would it 
 hmmm have you ever been tested for psychic ability dekkappai thats something thats been kicking about in the back of my mind as one of two todo or wish list bits a regular wpp newsletter same as the wikipedia signpost maybe produce on a biweekly or monthly basis 
 yeah i know i get pretty cranky about deletions but it seems to me that the main purpose of a project should be to organize work on its subject of interest and their are so many places within the projects reach that need lots of work a newsletter would be a good idea for that keep people informed on what needs to be done ideas on where to work or improve etc not to be overlycritical but it seems like these playmate articles would be core articles for the project and thorough searching for sourcing or article work should have been done before these N day deadlines have been imposed another big gap is softcore or grindhouse or drivein films and their personnel from the N sN s 
 wikipedia is not a spoksman of the united nations i tried to be diplomatic by writing serbian breakaway province of kosovo and not even that is accepted by you serbians 
 thanks bordering albania via the breakaway province of kosovo is at least much better than just ignoring what is currently going on in kosovo because the un security council is unable to reach unanimity 
 hi vitriden i have seen that you have reverted my edit there is a difference between notable players and notable former players burzanoviuN castillo and gueye are alredy notable players in the squad i didnt put there barcos or bronowicki and also jestroviuN or koroman making differencies between players from serbia and yugoslavia isnt so practical but i didnt have beter idea how to do that in this case i think that your revert wasnt right 
 oh yeah milovanovic an basta are also notable players not former but notable 
 ok we can agree to add just former players on the list but also we must put flags beside players name or to write down country above player names it is unusual that mao molina is in the middle of the list among all serbian or yugoslav footballers someone would think that he is born serbian of etc spanish descent 
 ok i hope that we will have a good cooperation on red star article cheers 
 hello i saw that you had edited by user page i havent given my self any barnstar i just stored them there so i know where i can find them next time i want to award someone who knows it may be you one day 
 jouN jednom bora sa arsenom ima snimljen jedan poluzvaniuN dan album arsen and bora uN corba unplugged N ono uN to se na zapadu zove album artist bio bi arsen dediuN and bora uN oruN eviuN kao jimmy page and robert plant coverdale and page ne znam laza ristovski and ipe ivandiuN itd 
 sorry for the delay i was in cuba from april N pedro and i were close friends his sister has given me all rights to release his photos she believes as do i that pedro has message to be said both then and now i was on the first pedro zamora foundation board of directors if wikipedia requires an additional release from his sister or father let me know 
 i will check with the folks at commons to see whats the next step should be thanks for the reply and i hope you enjoyed your visit to cuba 
 yes had a great time let me know and i will let his sister know 
 okay i heard back wed need an email or fax or letter from pedros family either transferring the rights to callelinea or releasing the photo under an appropriate license so thats what is needed a statement from milagros essentially backing up what you said 
 replied on my talk 
 thanks for your help but i thought id point out thanks again 
 i realized that problem in the later pages i did up but forgot to doubleback to check the first one thanks for the cleanup 
 hi tabercil if there was any question what this playmates are not notable line was all about total i dont like it cleansing of the topic 
 sigh lemme see what i can do 
 had a suspicion something like this would happen putting them together was a nice visit through my illspent youth though ah well 
 notice the edit summary i just now realized speedy was meant because of the moral tone of some of these guys i thought seedy was intentional 
 lol well thats likely a typo on hullas part ghod knows if you look back over my edits you will likely find a similar slip or three everything else is just the normal boilerplate for a prod 
 what about this template is for articles which involve an article about an evolving current sportsrelated event which is either changing rapidly or about which understanding is rapidly evolving as an advisory to editors it may also be used in those occasions that many editors edit an article on the same day and it is not intended to be used to mark an article that merely has recent news articles about the topic the article is mostly edited by you and a couple of other editors and the editing isnt nearly enough to warrant a warning to our readers 
 i think you are misunderstanding the purpose of the template it is not supposed to be used on all articles that are about something currently ongoing as confusing as it may sound basically 
 to be honest i never read the guidelines that way but i can see now where you are coming from i agree that the guidelines should be made a bit more clear in that regard they were mostly copied over from 
 actually im trying to nail it down to a given date but there was a comment on 
 this is your photo right the complexion of the subject seems unnaturely red at least on my monitor heres another photo of him id guess a professional portrait and heres a still from a video its possible that he was wearing makeup in those even so this photo looks like either there was something wrong with the lighting or camera or that he was severely sunburned any ideas and nbsp 
 or theres a third its not my photo to begin with the original photographer is luke ford he originally took photos of various porn stars then expanded for a time into do some meet and greetstyle events one of the nicknames he got pegged with on one of the porn star chat boards was the camera of death basically because whoever was photographed looked like death warmed over for example 
 ah i didnt understand the provenance i did a little adjustment and have uploaded this verion to commons and the article it still looks like hes got a sunburn but he looks less like a boiled lobster and nbsp 
 sokay a lot of folks cant seem to figure out how the credits section of commons works my nickname is absolutely unique as far as i know so if i plug it into google every hit that comes back as tabercil is a reference to me so image my surprise when a google search comes back with text indicating photos taken by me things such as http or or archivewncom or N or N or N or N or enttvasia 
 kad je reuN d o rasporedu fotografija veuN sam rekao mislim da je ovako nepregledno i nedovoljno lepo za oko meni smetaju uN dlanci na kojima nije usklauN en raspored fotografija sa tekstom istina primarna funkcija uN dlanka je davanje informacija i estetika nije najvauN enija ali zauN to se ne pozabaviti i njome uN cesto bar meni uN dlanci sa neskladnim rasporedom slika deluju pomalo neozbiljno ali kao uN to sasm veuN rekao to mi ne smeta previuN e i smatram da nije najbitnije 
 i have added some comments at 
 hey you are online could you check the 
 not reliable and the edits are otherwise unsourced 
 thanks 
 caos izvini sto te cimam al moram da te pitam sta mislis dal ce ta tekma da se racuna kao zvanicna za podatke i statistiku ili ne ja mislim da ne ali nisam siguran to je bila prijateljska igrali samo igraci iz nase lige a nije ni anta trenirao znas nesto o tome kako je tretirati i dali upisivati igracima tekmu kao a international appereance 
 ma jeste to od pomoci a i upravo si uporedio sa slicnom situacijom na millenium kupu bas zato se ovoga i pitam jer je recimo sajt ignorisao na spisku reprezentativaca igrace koji su samo igrali na tom turniru (
 by the way i have never called you an idiot read more carefully i have said you could be considered an idiot by someone looking at what you do without listening to what i had to say you must respect other people if you want other people to respect you simple as that now that we talk like normal people i want to apologize if i have offended you bye 
 theres no email account associated with jadrocker so i cant contact you that way what i would suggest is you email me if you look to the right of this page you will see toolbox click on that and you will see email this user as an option 
 hello while on page patrol yesterday i saw 
 if you do manage to get it up to that level let me know as i will gladly nominate it and good luck as it stands i dont see anything thatd give me cause to remove the prod 
 give me a while im a rookie editor its going to be a close call she has one nomination and a 
 here comes the crescendo to the band starting up i have improved lede and will place a citation i found that comes from a suze randall free site it is bound to get editwarred on because its not mainstream and not being reported by anyone else yet i hope to use my ytrikc_search to flush up more citations 
 the editwar has begun another admin jumped on my edits and disrespected the inuse template i lost data due to a lost of data session as well due to an edit conflict 
 rather than maligning other editors you shgould take the time to become familiar with the appropriate policies removing unsourced inaccurate promotional claims from a blp is an exception to N rr and removing an inaccurate internal link isnt a revert at all if you are not going to put the effort in required to comply with the blp policy you have got no business posting uncivil complaints about editors who do 
 hullaballoos admittedly aggressive about removing unsourced or poorly source blp stuff but hes right in that it is policy and i have had a chance to take a look at that suze randall award no efn way it should be in the article 
 the reverted version doesnt make sense bulgarias goal average is not what shown in the table and its inferior to that of france so the latter should have qualified instead of bulgaria 
 bulgarias points were miscalculated but its still inferior to france 
 were hungarys totals included and ndash 
 i did my own calculations and bul was higher than fra i also recalculated isr and it was off by N and ndash 
 so eventually the results against hungary do count otherwise it wouldnt make sense 
 i think uefas precedent of not counting the lastplaced team in world cup qualifying must have confused the people and ndash 
 what uefa and fifa world cup has to do with fiba and eurobasket different sports different governing bodies different rules 
 the logic since more games more points so they cant use points to compare teams that played different number of games so they used winning percentage instead and ndash 
 i believe that your user name is outside of wikipedia guidelines i wanted to let you know also that it offends me quite a lot can you please change it thank you 
 this is approaching the conduct of a 
 thank you tabercil for your clarifying comments as far as references for articles are websites valid sources of info and can you reference other wikipedia pages 
 yes websites can be used as sources but what needs to be considered is whether they are 
 hi vitriden i noteced you fixed mile kos at ofk beograd coache section recently another editor asked me if i could find the name of dmiliuN who coached ofka just a bit later duuN ko stubbornly all sources i could find name him only as dmilic any idea best regards 
 ohoho pa mile kos je bio golman jugoslavije zvezde metalca i proletera super clanak narocito je interesantan deo koji govori o odnosu klubova pre i posle drugog svetskog rata kaze okupacione vlasti su zabranile jugoslaviju pa smo igrali kao sk N znao sam za tu promenu imena ali nisam znao razlog bas sam sad u skorasnje vreme gledao da sto vise poboljsam clanke o tom predratnom periodu pomogla mi je knjiga zivka bojanica a i sklopio sam nekako clanak 
 please continue the discussion at 
 hi tabercil we have got an editor who has twice removed a sourced statement about a cast member in direct reference to the film 
 i restored since its clearly reliably sourced but its been reverted this dispute will no doubt continue at 
 re 
 thanks for looking in tabercil but with you seem to have mucked things up i think the version previous to your edit is the correct one we seem to be having slow server issues which may have confused things also besides a nude role being notable for the time period i think just the fact that the role generated an entire news article is a pretty good indication of notability far more so than most individual facts in articles have anyway i will step out i have done far more reverting in this case than i like to but this one seemed pretty obvious 
 yup i thought i was reverting edit and even took steps to confirm it was most recent 
 please do not remove 
 will do guess i missed that one 
 a {{
 thanks i hadnt created the article just categorized it no opinion on the deletion at this time 
 since you have worked on this article please weigh in on whether 
 nope thats a selfpublished book by luke see 
 regarding your creation of 
 great information i had read an article describing a process to cut and paste the content and then put a redirect on the old article name the move link is a great idea that should minimize the chance of missing a step 
 i found that subpage of yours because its using a main article space category just a heads up that the category is there and also the template might not be needed anymore since all the years have been covered 
 yup deleting it now 
 im curious about your edit what makes you say its a company of the united states its really a french company with all r and d taking place in france its owned by oracle but does that make it american 
 the first line of the article reading sunopsis is a global company with headquarters in boston for the united states is what lead me to that assessment 
 ok i think you have been misled the crucial bit there is for the united states if a company has a hq for the us in the us does that make them a us company no 
 good points the original wording implied the company had N headquarters without clarifying that one was the us headquarters one was the european headquarters etc i have researched and reworded i didnt find any clarification as to where their headquarters was in france if you have that it would be a nice addition 
 thank you for commenting yes i agree worthy of comment in the overall scope of the topic realize this recent breach exceeds or roughly equals the history function and organization sections it seems to be given undue weight 
 hi tabercil i have added as many references as i can to jennis page but she doesnt like the this biographical article needs additional citations for verification please help by adding reliable sources contentious material etc staying on her page i have told her this is a process could you tell me when this notice might change thank you 
 offhand id say it can be removed i would point out one thing 
 cheers 
 many thanks it persuaded me to turn off the computer and go to the chippy so it wasnt all bad d 
 hi tabercil hullaballo is once again instigating edit wars involving multiple pages and multiple editors rather than discuss as suggested he reverts his contested edits he forces other editors to either editwar with him or to accept his edits which obviously he wants i take pride in not editwarring yet this one editor has got even me to break this rule at times the edits of his i reverted recently were reinsertions of his own edits that had been undone by two three other editors this is bullying pure and simple when is this editor going to be brought in line with proper wikipedia editing practice as explained in 
 stop complaining about the big bad wolfowitz and start addressing the policy issues these are garden variety nfcc violations and saying no they are not and tossing invective at me isnt good faith discussion as for edit warring you have edit warred complete with uncivil personal commentary beginning with the first editing dispute we had for all your passiveaggressive styling yourself as the victim of bullying bias etc etc these disputes simply arise over and over from your complete unwillingness to accept consensus notions of notability and reliable sourcing and its hardly accidental that virtually all the disputed material is taken from advertising on retailer or vendor sites 
 the big bad wolfowitz get over yourself and address the issue editwarring stop it or get blocked everyone else has to abide by this you do too 
 reverting to enforce certain overriding policies is not considered edit warring removal of content that unquestionably violates the nonfree content policy you might also keep in mind 
 several days after your deletions i did not dispute your citation of policy other editors did i disputed your reversions of those others edits without discussion those editors have a dispute with your deletions and you need to discuss with them rather than instigating an editwar which your reversions do your dredging up of past unrelated and controversial incidents further indicates a refusal to address my concern here your editwarring 
 folks both of you play nice okay my computers sick so i cant really spend much time online right now and i cant certainly dig in to try abd figure out whos right and whos wrong but i do know that its likely that both of you are right and both of you are wrong hulla you are good at pulling out dubious information but i do think you take too dim a view of some sources dekka you are a good editor but in this instance i do think you are a touch thinskinned my suggestion for now avoid each other if possible 
 thanks for the input and hope your computer problems are resolved quickly actually this is a case where hb is warring with other editors im just sick of seeing him continuously get his way this way i suppose its time to bring his behavior up to rfc or some such thing but im too lazy to instigate that kind of thing maybe one of the others will rgards 
 whats not english in the article i have removed the tag because fide is the name of the organisation it is all english 
 my thought to have the organization name fxeN dxeN ration internationale des xcN checs translated into english which upon further examination means world chess federation in french 
 this message was placed automatically and it is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists if that is the case you can remove the tag from the article and it would be appreciated if you could drop a note on 
 maybe see if it works uN 
 wow thanks your the man thats a little embarrassing i wasnt even close i got a lot more to learn i guess 
 less is sometimes more ] uN 
 btw you need to change the second see also in the replace to notes other than that it works awesome thanks again 
 oops uN 
 has been categorized 
 same comment re 
 excellent catch i have pushed them down into 
 have noticed the revertathon tonight time to request semiprotection 
 replied on the users talk page 
 replied on the users talk page 
 thanks 
 just to make sure is 
 see edit actually the source which already was there does state the ethnicities i checked it out when the ip changed it 
 huh when i reverted i knew i had read that source ages ago and was sure i remember it as mentioning only her being jewish nothing about the german or swiss part shoulda doublechecked first thanks for the correction 
 you are not alone my first thought was also to revert the ip since i was quite sure i checked out that source before 
 btw nice job in getting these new images on commons 
 hmm you referring the tg stars i assume ah de nada still surprised i got them 
 im obviously not tabercil but you can see why the article was deleted basically it kept being recreated and deleted the reason it was deleted is because of wikipedias criteria 
 as dismas sez it kept getting recreated with the same thin information unless or until someone can clearly show that cody lane is notable there aint gonna be anything there 
 as i said unsourced 
 it appears that ivdr is exclusively known by that name and no other name so it doesnt even enter the realm of whether or not usage is more common than would be other names information versatile disk for removable usage appears to be the etymology or meaning behind the name elongating the title would be akin to renaming the 
 great examples all since there is currently no known need for disambiguation both are probably valid when speaking or writing about technology i err on the side of using the full name unless its really moved from jargon to a common cultural lingo for example you could speak with the common man about 
 good fun 
 with your pentagrams and demons in my country this is havery offensive also i had to tell sean a quick message so im just telling you before i talk to him ok 
 you should know that the pentagram is an ancient symbol and is not a devilworshipping symbol not to mention being as religious as any other symbol but hell i wont get onto that now either way as much as we are all trying to help the situation klptyzm made the right point in saying how we should avoid posting on his talk page unless its necessary such as dispensing a warning or two uN 
 heres another point when the article started off as a single sentence summary by a beginner user it was clearly created by mistake this was quickly halfremedied within a few minutes with the template indicating that even the creator of the article saw the need to fix it while you might be opposed to its official name ivdr as the article title in favor of something more obscure why revert my edits to a mistakenly worded title the article title was originally missing the word usage uN 
 my mistake regardless of whether to use the acronym or the full name per 
 theres no consensus support for the efforts of a few members of the unreferenced blp project to unilaterally redefine the unferenced blp tag thats been in use for years has been used on tens of thousands of articles and is still being used by many skilled and experienced editors tts also incompatible with the blpprod standards external links arent references as is made clear in 
 good point and in anycase im trying to do an end run around the problem by trying to find sources to expand it with best thing i can locate seems to be mary kays fan site online not as good as id like but better than nothing i guess 
 sorry to have to but in on your talk page but as he doesnt seem to want to talk to me its not a good point its an absolutely crap point almost as bad as avoiding direct discussion and edit warring over this like hw seems to be doing one could argue that keeping the blpunrefered tag over other more suitable tags is a technique used by some to artificially inflate the unreferenced blp problem and totally ignore that there are lots of other blp cleanup tags that also should be addressed this tag simply takes it outof one cleanup cat and puts it into N other cleanup cats still there still trackable still marked as being unacceptable and a problem the only reason that we have a target number is because of a few editors who ignored the rules and made it a big deal earlier this year and threatened massdeletion of these articles the only reason that no one is working through the other lists is because the unrefed blps got all the attention in the past N months we have seen two useful generic tools the wolterbot cleanup list and the alertbot stop working but i have helped get the dashbot list to automatically list ublps by project once the heat drops out of this issue there is no reason why that same system cant be used for other cleanup tags id agree with hw if i was adding imdb links and then changing the tag but im only doing it to ones that already have the tag as i said on hws overly long talk page to the everyday editor imdb is a ref and they cant tell the difference between an ext link and a ref the imdb tag tells them it isnt enough the ublp tag doesnt 
 by infrastructure just that instead of performing the task by hand you were putting in place all the pieces to have it accomplished automatically the list of pages to monitor the account to run it under i had wanted to clarify that i didnt think that adding that categorypage was the goal in and of itself but that you were doing so to accomplish something down the road 
 you cant use the imdbs biography page as a source for wikipedia its not deemed to be reliable see 
 yes i know i made note of that in the appletalk articles talk page 
 i responded to the power mac name thing in my talk page i also looked at the list of articles you worked on and your interests good stuff computer history is also one of my areas of interest and mac history is of course one of the areas i know best cheers 
 see response in my talk page 
 well obviously you can prefer any version you like but the article should promote the correct form 
 im at work so i cant check the risquecom source that the ip claims to have used for a source for 
 yesh risques a pay site so its difficult to figure it out theres a blog entry there which states vicca had a birthday today but thats insufficient in my opinion by itself the other two items that ip gives wont do the job imdb wont fly as a source and her manager doesnt give us something we can go do as a backup 
 if you will not desist in removing tagging work from people who are patrolling short pages you will be blocked 
 short pages like article stubs (
 i am thinking of using one or two enbeded switch statements to do this however i am not certain how the table should look like 
 that can certainly be done but the tricky part would then be the formatting how to tell the template to arrange particular insignia vertically rather than horizontally thats why my first draft copied all the images or formatting in and then just displayed the requested set i guess the N and N settings in your lists above are meant to indicate which row each insignia should appear in since it seems like the insignias for a particular country or force are always displayed together id suggest moving everything out of the call except which officer ranks exist for that country and the names assigned to them can be kept in the template code itself rather than having to be written into the call each time unless you want to be able to do things like just display officer ranks N N N and N of the turkish army then all that detail needs to be in the call to the template i will work on it for a while now 
 ok i put together a very simple template at 
 i somewhat like 
 unmarking marked patrolled pages is vandalism stop 
 tx for commenting the message seems templated perhaps im wrong if you can explain further what issue you are speaking of perhaps we can work together towards a solution the only contribution i made to that page was to categorize it once upon a time and then remove some comments in the article unrelated to the topic good fun 
 hi as you recently commented in the 
 the information you are adding states unreleased hardcore b or g video that means its not available for public viewing we have only your word that it is a hardcore video and thats not good enough as it stands it is still spam and i have no link to nikki nova whatsoever 
 the existence of the hardcore clip where you found a trailer for is no more than a rumor it may be true or maybe not but 
 hello there thank you so much for blocking the same ip user from vandalizing edits but there is a problem again the ip user N is unblocked and continue vandalizing and disrupt edits for the incorrect year of birth on natasha yi article so write a warning message to ip user N do not vandalize edits just like we did from the prevois old message now i am writing to you a second new message to assist you i know i am not an administrator so could you write to the ip user N a warning not to disrupt edits if the ip does not respond to you and continue doing vandalism i will reply you back if the ip does continue edits so thank you and reply me back as soon as possible 
 reverted and blocked yknow you can do the revert yourself 
 so the android article is a good analogy its categorized under 
 that huge original research plot summary needs sourcing to reliable sources 
 calling userorangemike a user whos been here for six years a vandal is not on either 
 assuming you still even use it do you have the url to newsbank i lost it when i switched to firefox thanks 
 cheers 
 all scores are accurate as of N N july N 
 must have been a mixup if i gave any offense or labeled inaccurately that article has been shifting between extreme ends of discussion of the right mix of synopsis and critical analysis and parties coming in and ripping out mass amounts of content not sure that either perspective is a joke or vandalism will check on the talk page to see how consensus is developing 
 are you even areading what you are restoring 
 in the situation described above in this same section yes 
 and you dont consider that big glob of ridiculousness nonsense 
 if you are referring to the synopsis and other analysis in 
 so after reading my long and drawn out story my question for you is how do you think we should handle this should we just try and continue to discuss this on lars page should we take this to 
 id give you a long answer but i pretty much agree with everything you have said i am waiting to see a response to my last post there and i am expecting to have to bring it to the communitys attention somewhere soon 
 you got a response issues #N and #N of icestormN s list are being discussed already i hope you both will join in the discussion of them ++ 
 could you check out the edits by 
 yup very suspicious one of the images uploaded of taylors already been tagged for deletion and that will almost certainly go all the other uploads by the user prior to this have also been deleted as copyvios so i expect they will be cleaned out shortly 
 no problems for me though you might want to make sure the removal sticks 
 i have it on my watch list i dont want to get involved in an edit war its not my style so i will give it a few days and i will revert it again if it gets put back again after that i would hope for some support from editors who are familiar with and understand our policies and than maybe slap a couple of official warning templates on the editors talk page im equally concerned about etiquette because the editor has left abuse on my talk page thanks for your vigilance 
 well im an admin so i am more familiar with policies i have pulled it on the basis that it should properly be on the article about the bus company not the school as for what the editor left on your page id certainly call it rude but im not sure id term it as abusive 
 thank you for letting me know im not N per cent clear how to verify that this block is legitimate because your message doesnt give me anything to trace to or provide any specifics on how to respond either way i do agree with the policies you reference the only thing that clues me in is the subjective sillysong in the section title which almost makes me suspicious this is related to another editor that was blanking content in an song article with similar claims if it is legitimate and or or you need any response from please let me know 
 either i found a bug when using #tagref as a ldr or my brain is shot please look at 
 yes there are several bugs related to ref stacking or #tag this is largely a side effect of the fact the original cite code was designed under the assumption that ref stacking would always generate an error that and the outoforder parser evaluation rules for #tag are a giant pain 
 thanks i thought i was doing something wrong at first is there already a bug report on this issue outoforder parser evaluation explains some of the oddities i was seeing uN and nbsp 
 yes there is one regarding ref stacking somewhere your specific example is new to me but the underlying problem is the same 
 although that implies that is should work with #tagreferences but that construct is used in uN and nbsp 
 thank you for letting me know ohnoitsjamie i have to admit im very suspicious of your interest and credibility in your actions you were one of the people advocating for removing content from the article you appear to be offended about and are rendering administrative decisions i would recommend you leave that to a neutral objective third party if you have an active interest in the topic whether or not you have that level of authority you would appear more credible to others if you recused yourself from topics you had argued passionately about on one side or the other i regret the article couldnt come to consensus as a result of some levelheaded discussion cant say im seeing a way to rationally converse with the deletionists there jumping in and out basically saying i find it funny delete it 
 just so we are N per cent clear on this add the material again and the next block will be for a month 
 if you havent reviewed it recently check out the essay 
 i assume you are the manager of this page which means you certainly have the power to determine appropriate links but i really didnt think adding a link that can guide interested people to thora birch content in their local libraries is spam it isnt like there are google ads on that page but as i said you are the arbiter so be it i have to admire the control that keeps spurious links from polluting the resource 
 sorry for butting in but the link doesnt work for me so spam or not i dont see the point in keeping it if it doesnt work 
 my problem wasnt whether the link worked or not but rather whether it met the test of 
 im disappointed that you wasted my time reviewing this request you must have known before you requested the review that you were acting inappropriately please be aware that when users waste admin time on unnecessary unblock requests their talk pages are sometimes disabled 
 im not sure what the process is that assigns out unblock requests but my presumption is that you are voluntarily performing the task please dont see it as a waste of time but as part of the process of reconciling different views on what wikipedia should be im not offended by the block above but i will continue to call out that it should not be given a high level of credibility because it was initiated by an edited that had argued pasionately for one point of view on a single article then apparently used administrative privileges to selfadjudicate the issue placing a block on at least me if not others i dont know who had proposed a different point of view or at least proposed the area of disagreement be discussed using wikipedias talk page to reach some level of consensus the consensus was not clear that a wikipedia policy supported editors of any access level subjectively finding things funny or humoruous as a basis for exclusion from the encyclopedia i appreciate your time as an objective party reviewing the block and making a determination i fully accept the determination you have made and do want to be constructive and avoid any conflicts with nonconstructive editors in the future would you say that request to unblock from a block placed by an editor with administrator priveleges that had a conflict of interest in the issue would considered in the future as evidence of a systemic waste admin time on unnecessary unblock request 
 is there any proper discussion where the inclusion of this website has been discussed because right now i see over N edits by a 
 now digging through i came across a mention in 
 not clear of which you speak my only recent edits to that were and both had comments in the edit summary and some related discussion on the 
 glad to hear i thought it was true to the song and probably would have been informational to many as there is a probably a bump in attention due to nate doggs recent passing unfortunately various admins on wikipedia will play prosecutor judge juror baliff and executioner or deletioner of that kind of content without your view being considered glad it added something for you upon the aforementioned difficult news 
 great question it looks like most of 
 if you think that this notice was placed here in error contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled click here to contest this speedy deletion which appears inside of the speedy deletion tag doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a preformatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted you can also visit the 
 just a polite note to advise that its up for tfd following discussion i tagged for speedy by mistake using twinkle whilst looking through tags therefore removed myself and tagged appropriately 
 please do not make the tfd personal as you did by calling me arrogant in your edit summary i know you created it and therefore have a strong feeling its needed but do not make anything on wiki personal 
 you are making this extremely personal whether comment or person its the same thing any articles on my watchlist are monitored as i assume the copa america articles are on yours the best thing would be for us both to step back from this there is no point in this becoming personal wikipedia is a community and nobody has the right to attack other users or feel they own anything i will continue to warn users and revert when i see it as as 
 fair warning that recreating the article in its current state would likely lead to a listing on 
 after rereading your post on my talk and thinking about the geographical situation here it appears that you are not asserting she is notable or interested in recreating the article N more reasons to move on nice one 
 please do not falsely label edits as 
 continuing to work against a consensus that one is aware of is usually construed as vandalism 
 no it isnt please familiarize yourself with 
 no it isnt vandalism yes editwaring against consensus is sanctionable fwiw the whole flagicon issue is moot as no logged in user needs to see it 
 it isnt moot its the mos 
 editing in noncompliance with the mos is irritating and sanctionable if it is a pattern but it is not vandalism 
 to explain why i think the whole issue is a look at the following picture 
 thanks for reverting vandalism on my user page i didnt notice 
 all in a days work 
 can you 
 yesterday i translated this page >> into hebrew >> now this page is going to be deleted i want to ask you what is this mean national squares is this mean a square a street a boulevard please help me to understand this 
 why it says square if there are showing also streets avenues or plazas can you explain me plaese 
 yeah absolutely i doubt it will need tweaking but if the shock does happen it will be amended accordingly i imagine the aussies will try and get it done even within the final few kilometres of the race when time loss wont be possible yeah i will lift the stage profiles from there as im doing the rest of the refs on that page at present the only thing about the final stage i like is the finish that said dont want to see another abdoujaparov on the line 
 definitely up there with one of the better tours over recent years the unpredictable nature of the last week alone made up for a belowaverage giro the vuelta and world championships will be around sooner than we know it 
 ps not sure about the crab thing i thought it was fine but i will leave that one up to others to decide 
 i thought that as they are discreet issues it would make following any thread of discussion arising to keep them distinct 
 discrete not discreet 
 dammit i always get those two the wrong way round 
 thank you 
 it sounds like your only concerns are the wikilinks if you will permit me i will change all the links for the politician and point them to the correct article 
 fyi rumours regarding david tennants personal life have been a problem with respect to that article for years now while many ips and new editors have added text about it there has not yet been a reliable enough source to support keeping the material before removing the mail link i did review it and also searched wikipedia for past discussions regarding the daily mail as a 
 thanks for this and for the history of edits to the article i take your point about reliability but there is also an article on the daily telegraph web site and i heard it mentioned on itv this morning i have joined in the discussion on the david tennant talk page regards

 hey there just letting you know that we have nominated 
 replied on the article talk page 
 thank you very much for your help on the article page of 
 i only have any firsthand knowledge of raf changi from around N but i have added the others to my watchlist and i will see what i can add thanks 
 moving on im looking for sources to cite the stowage of N xdN 
 is this any help or have you already seen these also see 
 again you have been such a great help cheers~ 
 dont apologize you did nothing wrong what precisely is the question that i have not yet answered 
 thanks for saying i dont have to apologise the bit about clarification on campaigning is where auburnpilot said i wasnt assuming good faith i think that meant i should have treated your why hasnt this rfa been closed as something separate from your activity on the rfa itself i saw it as part of the overall supporting your nominee thing thats what i wanted clarified but to be honest if you dont have a problem with what i said then dont worry about it i suppose what i am asking is if you would handle things differently when you nominate someone else in future 
 err i asked for a closure closure is important it gives us all 
 hello may i ask why do a hangon on this article it is a copy vio which i instantly recognized knowing a bit about him though it be from another just asking can we cleanup and keep copyvios 
 i agree that professor naghdi was very notable it is my understanding of copyvio that the copyvio section has to go and cannot remain in history would it not be best to completely rewrite the article not leaving the copyvio section in history which would make you the orginal author i could be wrong 
 there was a raf kingsnorth in wwi it was originally a rfc or rnas station which became a raf station in N and closed in N see 
 thanks for that mjroots but have you any references to confirm that there was a rnas base and it became raf in N but im not sure it was ever called raf kingsnorth i believe it was always raf policy never to use the same name twice for different locations i may be wrong but i have so far seen no formalreference to raf kingsnorth in wwN i have started a discussion about this on 
 now i would really like 
 the name lycopsida is a common error but incorrect under the icbn members of a group lycophytina should properly be called lycophytines as lycophytes implies lycophyta however i have not see lycophytines used in the literature 
 however i dont think that you are right in saying that lycopsida is to be corrected under the icbn says that if the name is automatically typified ie based on a family name then its ending must be corrected to those given in the code however the code explicitly allows names such as anthophyta chlorophyta parietales so i think that lycophyta lycophytina and lycopsida are ok as descriptive names note that if lycophyta is a descriptive name under the code it can be used other than for a division but the code is notoriously tricky so i may be wrong 
 i understand about descriptive names but lycophyta is not a descriptive name wolfplant is in no way descriptive if you look back at the early sources this is an error in ending attachment to lycopdiaceae and the name was not intended to be descriptive it is thus to be corrected under the icbn 
 if its clear from the author of lycophyta that it was explicitly based on the genus lycopodium and not on a more general application of the prefix lyco then im sure you are right and its correctable lycophyta seems to go back quite a long way was article N in the code then i wonder 
 clear by comparison across parallel items yes explicitly stated no as it almost never was in those days as far as your code question there was no icbn at the time there were separate european and american codes even as recently as the early N th century article N is not bound by date of publication 
 thanks for adding progaddafi to all N of my page entries i was just going to correct them and found you had done it already 
 isnt this table something more suitable for your sandbox the key information is already in another article using a well established format 
 also when doing this make sure theres a reasonable belief that the user is the subject of the biography for example why did you move 
 i think that usererin steel created frank garvey and where the names dont match i am careful to say copying biography page to userpage rather than using the term autobiography if i got mixed up and usererin steel was not the creator of frank garvey then that userpage should probably be deleted or be edited down to the userpage tag to avoid confusing the user truthbringertoronto N N july N 
 the same goes for the article about frank garvey if 
 hi please have a look at my comments at 
 you may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the 
 howdy there you might want to edit your statement in the afd discussion it was not dhartung who is the suspicious new user and yes i thought it very odd that a brand new account with three count em three edits was prodding an article and leaving maintenance tags on an article maintained by someone with over ten thousand edits i patrol the user creation log and although i may have been in the seafood section this time something smelled fishy to me 
 you are welcome heres the problem though i skate a bit too close to 
 i saw your response at the afd and im not entirely certain that i agree if there are so many books about air dispersion modeling either there ought to be more to say about the subject in the article or the books are largely redundant to each other and the value of the list is low on the other hand large bibliographies are positively welcome over at even for very short articles and right now there doesnt seem to be anyone working in your area of expertise 
 best 
 ok i wont make a big deal of it but how do you explain the existence of the firestop requirement under section N of the masterformat 
 hi i made a 
 sure feel free to spread information on vs this is after all a wiki 
 ok thank you so much how long have you been on wikipedia 
 since march N i believe uN 
 i restored the article but if there were copyright problems it would be better to rewrite the article with history deleted please copy the useful text notify me to delete it again and repost the content regards 
 N if you knew the article 
 theres also a longstanding policy that wikipedia is not a free webhost allowing vanity articles to remain in the userspace when the user in question has no other contributions makes it look like selfpromotion is acceptable in the userspace when its not instead of userfying you could also simply post a friendly message to the user who created the article result we have got rid of the article and the user doesnt feel bitten as much 
 oh and if you move something please use the move button at the top of the page so the edit history of the article stays intact if you dont have this button yet just wait a few days until you can or go to 
 N could i ask though that if you see an autobiographical article that doesnt belong in the encyclopedia that you consider moving it to the authors user page rather than speedydeleting it outright no this isnt myspace if its an obvious mistake sure but the ones you have been pulling this stunt with arent even close 
 seeing 
 personally i think the png version is fine as is but if you are going to change it to a svg version then please consider the above two points regards 
 okay scaling it down will be no problem though why N px in particular also i thought it would be better to keep the legend outside the image since it is basically text rather than graphics i really dont think representing text as graphics is a good idea 
 take a good luck at what is in the legend it is all needed to explain the colors etc if some user just inserts the image in an article and does not include the legend in the caption then confusion will reign thats why the legend is needed inside the drawing as for N px as i said before that is the largest size that will fit on an article page without needing to use horizontal scrolling if you make it much smaller than that the font may not be readable 
 also i will not change the image in the article until that bug is fixed since i agree it is no good without the arrowheads 
 hi m i see you are not a fan of the 
 if you feel strongly about this i suggest you make an attempt to have use of the 
 hi i am trying to expand on the 
 good luck and have at it 
 from a rather brief scan of the article it seems like a good start i dont have the time right now to go into it in depth i did straighten out the references and i also added quite a few more relevant see also links 
 i entirely agree the way i see it philippe here is my unofficial big brother i met him in a N rr warning and since then if i have any issues i go ahead and bring it to him otherwise i do some digging for answers to random things such as format policy images and all that fun stuff but see the fact that i do that searching is a good thing because instead of someone spoon feeding me the stuff i actually learn how to find utilities anyway i didnt want to actually vote in the mfd since i had a previous issue with ryry and i didnt want anyone to figure a conflict of interest thanks for your comments 
 on a completely seperate note i wanted to know if you had noticed that diligent terrier has a userbox that says that they perform admin duties but when i check the list of admins his name does not show there is he an admin or just masquerading its a little confusing cheers 
 i have been trying to wrap my head around a primary energy vs secondary energy problem you might know the answer or be able to point me in the right direction the problem is this if you add the upstream energy inputs that go into coal to the hhv of coal how does this compare against the energy content of the electricity produced or more specifically how much primary energy do you have to use to produce a given quantity of secondary energy using coal im looking for a rough thumbrule im guessing the primary or secondary energy ratio is about N to N cheers 
 found it N 
 thank you in advance and eagerly awaiting your reply 
 as explained in the 
 and you have requested adminship lord help us 
 substitutions turned these N characters into the ugliness shown above i changed my signature as soon as someone pointed out that it turned the edit space into the house of horrors im human i make mistakes sometimes i dont notice them right off the bat what you should be concerned about is how i go about fixing my mistakes and how i respond to someone who pointed out that i did something in a lessthanoptimalway 
 and what is your excuse for using childish obscene language in a posting see sh_t above does that qualify you for critiques of how articles should be written grow up 
 please stop being a drama queen if you want to attack the quality of my comments then do so on the basis of my comments not on the basis of completely inconsequential stuff physical mechanism and applications dont magically become referenced because the guy who said there were unreferenced said wrote shit in a colloquial way unless you want to address the merits and flaws of the article this discussion is over 
 young man whether sh_t is colloquial or not it still stinks that someone who has requested adminship should use it in a posting on talk pages in wikipedia this is no discussion it is the excuses of a juvenile who wont take responsibility for his actions and just say i was wrong and i regret it 
 could you try to say something else other than my dear young man when referring to other users as it can be seen as condescending and please try to stay more 
 i thought my edits to 
 please do not take deletion tags off of page if an editor thinks that the article needs to be deleted 
 i hope this explains the difference could you please revert the article to my version and make whatever improvements to that version which you think would be appropriate 
 sure but please be sure to expand 
 turns out your undo actually readded the nonsense word i guess sometimes 
 hi milton im very sorry to hear you are leaving wikipedia your professional and experienced contributions to the site will be missed 
 thanks for your many excellent contributions we have too few chemical engineers i hope you will consider returning after a break from the frustrations 
 i will certainly do what i can good idea to start it thanks 
 nice rewrite i changed my argument to keep and added a link on 
 good deal i couldnt find much per google earlier nice work 
 i may be wrong but cant an entry be tagged for both speedy deletion and proposed deletion in the case of 
 fair enough you will get no more trouble from me 
 thanks i have made a generic reply at 
 congrats i thought you were going to be away today 
 on the rfa i struck out that comment it turns out that my grandparents got dsl and i was bringing my computer anyway so i should be pretty active 
 let me know if you want help in resolving the disagreement but i think you can probably handle it by understanding the notability criteria are not personal apologizing for incivil or hurtful remarks or other personal attacks pointing out how the notability guidelines for articles on academic books are different from the guidelines for articles on general books and how the article this particular book meets those guidelines 
 once more thanks for trying to be helpful 
 ok thanks i will see what i can do about the article i think your last few messages have been exactly what is needed and i will see about putting them in the right place please keep improving our chemical articles i dont know the specific areas where wikipedia needs the most help in chemistry and chemical engineering but if it is anything like my area math then the answer is definitely we need help everywhere and having editors with more than a few years in the field is essential to giving needed perspective in these articles 
 mr beychok i never said that there was an issue with keeping the article if you look back my first edit was to the talk page where i provided evidence of notability in response to a post on the 
 i note that you had redirected 
 in my experience at wikipedia it wont be long before some environmental zealots will degrade the article into one lengthy diatribe against pollution they wont be interested in an article that simply explains what a pollutant is they will want it to include an essay on how horrible pollution is you will really have to be on your toes to constantly keep watch over the article 
 thanks for the feedback i did consider putting up the six epa pollutants and then it slipped my mind with regards to the epa link i try and be conservative with links and and use links that have a very strong relationship to the context the epa is linked from other links in the article so i feel that that is good enough i have many enviro article on my watchlist to guard against environmental zealots cheers 
 hi milton i proposed to merge the 
 for any further discussion you can email me directly using my wikipedia email i rarely vist wikipedia since i became completely disillusioned with wikipedia and transferred my energies into the online citizendium encyclopedia at citizendium for over a year now and have not encountered even one incident of vandalism nor had anything but pleasant collegial collaboration from other participants 
 a totally different paragraph different topic and different user hm 
 same article same day read the rule that was just a good faith warning 
 i dont know how to respond to your message about this article i listed it for deletion because its spam i dont think an unofficial name for a city is hardly encyclopedic besides the article was created solely for promotion of a nonnotable organization they already tried the article leaders of east orlando when that was deleted this page was created thanks 
 please read the wikipedia policy 
 well that is certainly an improvement can you tell me how it meets 
 good job now did you say so on the afd page if not just stick in there under my comment or under your vote cheers 
 mbeychock i understand fully what you say about people with no deep knowledge that edit contents just because they can do it i experienced it in the spanish wikipedia where i contributed most and it really discourages experts in a field to contribute it is a pity and wikipedia suffers from it it is probably against wikipedia policies but i would constraint the right to edit very technical articles to people who can probe expertise on a field meanwhile we can do nothing but see how articles which have been carefully written by an expert are mercilessly edited by laypersons nevertheless you can revert wrong edits and keep contributing whenever you feel like doing it you will be helping interested readers 
 jason thank you for your comment i now contribute primarily to the citizendium online encyclopedia where real names must be used and users must be registered to participate it is much more collegial and vandalism is practically zero 
 third its august N N please check my userpage for reasons why i really dont feel useful today ask another admin okay 
 done sorry i did not reply earlier i seldom visit wp any more 
 i removed the speedy delete tag and the copyvio tag from the article i note from the 
 done 
 thanks for the merge the article is much improved and notability is much clearer and mdash 
 i really dont know why i edit its not even about the hall talk page awaiting your input thanks 
 lost interest 
 shame i was expecting a proper discussion but glad you are not being stuffy 
 what does sock puppet mean if there is a dictonary of wikipedia terms could i have a link i am still illerate of many wikipedia words 
 a sock puppet is secondary account belonging to someone who already has one one where the account is being used to break wikipedias rules 
 further to your message i can see no reason why you are constantly editing out that 
 my edits improve the article without stating the obvious yours dont the style is well badly phrased poorly punctuated and frequently doesnt make sense other bits read like a womens magazine what more can i say dont try to read my mind you wouldnt like what you read i dont think its me who is incompatible or indeed sexist and i dont feel the need to hide my messages 
 ps you still dont get it do you 
 none of the above give you any excuse to suppress fact for the sake of it womens mag your attitude stinks you cannot change history live with it and move on 
 the external links you found do indicate a measure of notability imo his publications need to be references within the wp article 
 being a professor is an assertion of notability not a proof of it i recognize that some professors cannot be shown to be notable my point is that speedying them is almost always unwise 
 thanks and mdash 
 checking back it isnt as straightforward as i thought if an article has been deleted it wont show up in the users contribution list im inquiring on the admin board to see if there is a way to do this other than manually checking every deletion in the log and mdash 
 sorry if its been deleted its completely unintentional there was a paragraph which was removed so i added it back in it may have deleted some of your copyedit apologies if it has the write up i did for urbis was scruffy and rushed i wanted to jot down the refs i have collated then improve the write up regards 
 and i will note down changes in the edit summary if you wish considering you are improving the article simultaneously 
 i appreciate you are a meticulous editor more than the majority of editors out of interest have you got any improvement plans for urbis i do think that it is worth getting the page to ga status i was thinking to get rid of the listlike format that exists in the exhibit history section and replace it with text briefly explaining each exhibition 
 i am just a grumpy oldie who knows how to write a sentence a relative mentioned a glass building so i looked to see what it wasand wasnt impressed its a long way from ga and i have no interest in getting it there 
 hope its ok to butt in anyway i think ditching the list format for the exhibitions is a step in the right direction but where to go from there im not too sure it seems to have hosted in the region of N exhibits and explaining each one would be a lot of prose are they all really worth a sentence maybe the notable ones should be highlighted but then theres the editorial choice of which ones are notable i wonder how many of those exhibitions were award winning 
 norbert goeneutte was the eldest son in a family of six children as an aspiring artist he was placed in a difficult position when his father died in N leaving him to support this large family in N he nonetheless enrolled at the ecole des beauxarts joining isidore pilsuN s studio there he admired pilsuN s watercolour views of parisian street scenes executed during the siege after the death of pils henri lehmann became his new master during the second half of the N s goeneutte met marcellin desboutin who taught him to etch he also befriended many of the impressionists including 
 it is easily enough to persuade me that that while not in the very top tier of impressionist artists he is notable enough for an article there may not me enough source material for it to be very detailed but he definitely deserves a few paragraphs 
 daniel thanks they are very good sources i will get on with the translation and put in the appropriate references i think the best stuff will be mainly from the google books sources and so will dig more through them i will keep you updated but i think i will just get a page up then spend time working on it 
 how is my source unreliable 
 replied on the users talk page 
 you tagged 
 good job at the time i tagged the article it didnt really assert her notability but thats a great improvement now ~ 
 hi i have just written 
 not my territory at all just a neglected bit of industrial lancashire nobody else seems very interested in edit away you could never step on my toes 
 thanks 
 thanks for uploading so many good photos to wikipedia it would be helpful if you could upload these to 
 i have no intention of uploading to the commons as i find what i do simpler and easier to understand 
 ok fair enough 
 i see you ignored my request 
 what request i didnt interpret the message you left on my talk page as requesting me not to move them merely that you think doing so is unnecessary 
 well you interpreted incorrectly please do not move any more 
 sorry to intrude in this but i always look first on commons for photos to illustrate my articles it couldnt be easier to use you just put the commons file name in the usual pairs of square brackets and its there so it would make your pics more available to me but how to upload them i dont know but i would accept help cheers 
 the upload page for selfmade pictures on wikimedia commons is on wikimedia commons it is necessary to categorise images this can be a bit of a chore but i find that the 
 i have seen the commons upload page that is how i know i find it confusing so please dont point out the obvious to me it is not appreciated i dont use any gadgets and am bored by categories i just edit things i am interested in i really dont appreciate your help at all 
 that comment was aimed more at peter i vardy than you 
 go away and help someone else this is my talk page and i found it patronising 
 fair enough its no big deal 
 not to disparage or unfairly criticize my fellow wikipedian but i now understand your perspective on overzealous deletion much better 
 of course the article did not reference the national team part 
 and many times they have been deleted so this page should not only be deleted but protected from recreation i hope you understand why i am putting the tag up and will put a different one up shortly 
 well i dont think she really has a lot of notability just yet she was a contestant for a few weeks on the 
 good day how are you i just signed on roughly N minutes ago 
 im ok thank you how are you uN 
 in reference to your edit the csd was for a blatant copyvio not on the basis of notability thats why i used dbcopyvio not dbbio we still have copyright violations in the article history it would have been better for the article to have been deleted and started from scratch 
 thank you my worry was that the article might be deleted without someone starting over perhaps i should have renamed the copyvio file to a name like 
 just thinking that we probably should move some of the talk to the 
 thanks for your action on cyprus in this case i cannot take action against vandalism since i am the creator of the pages therefore it is inappropriate to use my adminship in this case but if you can act it would please me 
 i am not an admin see my unsuccessful bid at 
 hi just wondered if you have any comment to make on 
 as someone who is completely mesmerised by the category system i will have to think about it for a bit but i will get back to you 
 i thought i best bring this from 
 may i say to the anonymous author of the previous two comments that if s or he thinks that wikipedia is incorrect the discussion about this point should be carried out elsewhere it is not appropriate to continue on this page thank you 
 have you ever in your entire life voted to delete anything 
 yes 
 thank you for saving the stub on 
 i fixed it 
 hi i saw the flagged revisions as default on de wiki vandalism wants attention so the edit volume will go down after implemented at least i expect it i do not understand that it is not implemented yet on en wiki as on de wiki vandals are inverting the meaning of sentences the encyclopedia is worthless so you can have the impression that it is organized to get the encyclopedia meaningless get this thing live soon please 
 we are definitely working as fast as we can to get this up we are pretty close now as you can see at 
 regarding your statement that most parks are notable i cant find any policy guideline or precedent that says so can you point me to the page im overlooking 
 i was making a general observation rather than quoting policy in general a quick google search ought to turn up some evidence of notability for most parks particularly national or state or provincial ones even if no such references are listed in the article 
 anyway thanks 
 i have responded on the 
 hi i wrote the meglos source on the discussion page and didnt mess with the footnotes on the article page as i dont know how to do that so if you want to check it out and put it back if its considered an acceptable source please do so its near the bottom in the aregion N and N releases from N section if you see an update by me i will put it there unless i learn the footnote system angeloz 
 hi again i edited it once more with a footnote this time but am really uncertain if it was done properly angeloz 
 are you sure your edits are the correct way to do this would you please point me in the direction of a wp that explains this thank you 
 hello the columns that indicated that the characters were mentioned in other films were spanning all the remaining films in the series rather than the individual films so all i did was fix the spanning issue also separating the scream N column as at this stage we dont know whether these people will or wont appear the 
 okay i just wanted to make sure it was the more appropriate option 
 hi i have just seen your recent edits to the music inspired by lord of the rings article and your assertion that swedish titles only capitalise proper nouns ituN s interesting that you have chosen to do this because it had also occurred to me that the capitalisation may be incorrect so i checked with the swedish wikipedia the albums corresponding swedishlanguage article capitalises its title as sagan om ringen i was just about to change the capitalisation on the englishlanguage wikipedia myself when i saw that youd already done it although in a slightly different way now im no expert on swedish and i assume that you know more than i do about this kind of thing but surely if the swedish wikipedia capitalises the album as sagan om ringen then that is probably the correct way wouldnt you say 
 hi im no expert either but im pretty sure that my usage is right im wondering if there is some reason that theres a special case with the album only or whether the swedish wikipedia is wrong 
 oh ok we will leave it as is then uN youuN re probably right anyway can i ask why you have moved the article to music inspired by lord of the rings there is only one album with this title on wikipedia therefore under wikipedia naming conventions as outlined at 
 well i agree with you totally that the bo hansson album should be under 
 well although i do sort of feel that the article belongs at music inspired by lord of the rings i can also see that having that as a disambiguation page is useful because the album titles are so similar however im not really understanding your problem with simply having it at located at music inspired by lord of the rings there is no need to mention bo hansson in the title to disambiguate further because there is only one album called music inspired by lord of the rings on wikipedia the mention of bo hansson is totally superfluousespecially when we already have a disambiguation page to differentiate between the two similarly named albums im sorry if im misunderstanding what you are saying here but as far as i can see if the article isnt located at music inspired by lord of the rings then it should definitely be at music inspired by lord of the rings as per the manual of style for popular music by the way id like to get this sorted out as soon as possible because the article will shortly be appearing in the 
 and i have just realised that i didnt congratulate you on the article and thanks for being one of the most civil editors i have come across 
 thank you for your kind words and compliments on the articleuN i couldnt believe that an album as well known as this one didnt already have a wikipedia article and yet other more obscure bo hansson albums did so i decided to rectify the situation immediately initially i only intended to create a fairly brief stubclass article but then i got a bit carried away and ended up writing loads d anyway yeslets transclude this discussion to any relevant talk pages i will leave it up to you to decide where it should be transcluded 
 hi truthbringertoronto you might want to take another look at 
 you are right i changed my vote from keep to neutral 
 hi i have expanded the article a bit 
 good work thank you very much 
 why doesnt it get italicized like every other name 
 some british ship classes are named for the common theme (like the 
 ah that makes sense thanks do you know who is responsible for picking names the 
 i do believe it is the admiralty who chooses the names as to the guideline i will do you one better it is in the naming conventions 
 on 
 yes i do thank you very much i think that there is an article on the group in the hebrew wikipedia which you might also want to expand 
 the link requires a log in and so isnt really much good as proving notability so i restored tidy and prodded at the same time 
 thanks i will see what i can do with it 
 we have only three sourced sentences to consider so how about a merge to 
 sounds perfect to me 
 i noticed in your edit comments on 
 thanks for pointing that out i have now removed the prod 
 hey out of curiosity why is your name truthbringertoronto if you are in montreal former torontonian that escaped perhaps 
 no former montrealer living in toronto and going back to montreal fairly frequently 
 thats still saying it sold N in the rest of the world you could at least say N million + 
 replied on the users talk page 
 mmm sorry cant help you there never heard of it 
 thank you 
 why doesnt it justify its own article it has enough references and sourced information to become its own article its too large to just be a subsection of a film series article nff needs to be taken with a common sense approach 
 it doesnt need its own article just yet theres not enough information for it to need to be split from the main series page and can easily fit on the series page 
 about the school distract i deleted i did not see an assertion of the subjects importance i would read 
 ok i am inclined to undelete this article to a user subpage for you i am warning you the article as it is if you want me to undelete to one of your user subpages for you tell me where you want it undeleted to if you plan on fixing the article from its current state you have some work on your hands thanks for your interest uN uN 
 ok undeleted to 
 regarding please see 
 in this case would suggest you take it to the articles 
 yes i should have done that from the start rather than going via user talk pages please comment there the bulk of the changes in your revert are about date format changes but while numerous those changes arent very important since both formats are in fact acceptable the problem is that your revert restored a number of incorrect changes as i have previously noted 
 yes my main issue is with the date format the only other thing i can spot that my edit changes is replacing a previously moved reference for tangled and removing a future studio ghibli film which actually may not even be released by disney anyway 
 i have noted all of the changes in your edit at 
 okay with all the date changes its difficult to see 
 i understand that it was frustrating to see this being reverted back and forth as if they were just date format changes when i tried to point out other legitimate concerns im sorry if my general frustration about this were reflected in my tone towards you 
 sorry if i added to your frustration i was just going by the edit summary which only mentions date changes and didnt spot the others thanks for pointing them out think i have put everything back now or at least addressed individually the points if not then let me know 
 im glad we could work this out 
 the canada revenue agency web site confirms that this is a registered charity with business number N rrN if you think that the article could be expanded into a useful one could you please restore it 
 the only content there was an external link to the missions site and the talk pages content was an attempt to contact the mission this made them deletable under the third 
 thanks 
 i am not an 
 i see you have removed the tag i put on this article i added this because i can see no evidence of notability in the article however i do admit i know nothing at all about the band can you say whether it is notable or not if not i shall put it up for afd and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 at the time i removed the tag i thought that the bands multiple records and multiple reviews were enough to establish notability but perhaps the record labels arent important enough and the reviews are too brief to prove notability i wont be upset if the article is deleted but i think on balance that the band is notable 
 i believe that this particular article does not warrant a db but instead might warrant review under afd 
 regarding please see for context the user is trying to match the numbers in that 
 ah i see where they come from now i must admit i didnt really look into it i just assumed that the other editor was putting them in chronological context with the wdas series when the films are a subset of a larger set then this does cause numbering problems im inclined to agree that maybe these shouldnt have numbers as a chronological list would suffice in these cases 
 the sectioning is not appropriate first you are unnecessarily extending the table of contents and the sections just because you want each film by itself this is a franchise page its meant to do a very basic summary of all the films if people need to see independence then they should go to those pages the flow is much better as a single prose section instead of multiple broken up sections as for the links they are unneeded all the films are linked in the overview and in the navbox they dont need repeated links so close if you disagree then go to the talk page and seek consensus for something that is been around for a long time 
 there is no policy or guideline that says this is the way it should be the current structure has been around for a long while if you dont like it then you should start a talk on the talk page to see if others agree im going to work and will look forward to your topic discussion on the talk page in the meantime i would appreciate it if you would respect the history of the page and dont change it to your preferred version until a consensus to do so 
 i really think theres room to be a bit more openminded with regard to my changes if you look at a lot of other film series or franchise pages they are laid out in much the same way 
 damn can we just settle on a title for this section theres several articles that link to this section and im trying to fix them its really annoying 
 do you see my reasoning for not putting the brackets in though 
 yes i have no problem with your edit i wish they would confirm the title already same with the spiderman reboot 
 daniel thanks for your help with getting the page better organized is there a reason why the updating is not yet publicly displayed i think some people clicking over from some of the other wiki pages i added it to are confused 
 not that i can think of when you update an article the result is normally effective immediately even if there is a delay with the database it normally becomes visible within a few seconds 
 you need to stop editing articles on subjects in which you have an obvious conflict of interests if you do not then you will get permanently blocked i really cant put it more simply than that 
 please do not remove 
 its gone already btw what makes you come to the conclusion that the song is notable 
 please follow the 
 this isnt a requested move but redirecting a page which should never have been created in the first place as per 
 i dont know if there is a template or procedure for what you are proposing then other than opening another afd and #xN and nbsp 
 the discussion on the talk page is good enough 
 i think then it might be a good topic on the admin board when is a delete not a delete and #xN and nbsp 
 see 
 thanks for pointing that out and #xN and nbsp 
 hey could you come back over to the ga review you were doing for 
 i changed the status to on hold and added detailed comments on what still need to be done the issue you couldnt find is one i fixed myself 
 sure send them to johnadkinsN gmailcom thanks 
 thanks a lot these will be a big help 
 thanks for the headsup i thought i was helping i wont do that any more i do disagree though about simply moving the article to a userpage as that leaves a page on wikipedia with the same title just turning it into a redirect hence everyone gets his own wp page weehee any comments thanks 
 within a few days someone will usually remove the redirect wikipedia policy doesnt generally permit redirects from article space to user space 
 if you find yourself in an editing dispute use the articles 
 not really i was trying to initiate the discussion the other user was the one who was reverting without contributing please see discussion here 
 there is no exemption fromn N rr for contributing to a discussion the only exemptions are for clear vandalism or reverts of banned or blocked users using sockpuppets this is clearly not such a case 
 im aware of this but i havent made more than N reverts 
 i have reverted your redirect and started a discussion on the talk page we shall see outside opinions and decide from there 
 the speedy criteria aN has changed recently it no longer requires a copyvio to be from a commercial provider if you take a look at the page theres a clear copyright notice on the page could you explain why you removed the notice was it because the author wikified the page so it looks like he might have changed it to a noncopyvio thanks 
 sorry i didnt see your notice on 
 thats a bit of a nuisance i know that if you shrink the page it shrinks the other stuff because the infobox has a fixed width im not sure why at your lower resolution it isnt just taking up N per cent of the available white space though i think that table really is best suited at the top but i dont want a huge gap there perhaps there is some markup to change the infobox width 
 i will ask at the help desk they helped me with an infobox issue before if you dont mind though and if you are able to at work if you can send me a screen of what you are seeing so they understand itd be helpful 
 that would be fine supervegetaukN @yahoocom 
 thats what i see if i shrink my window down so it doesnt seem to be a resolution issue but the result of your reduced viewspace i will submit to the helpdesk and see if there is any advice they can offer as id really like to keep that table at the top but obviously cant have that gap there 
 noticed you reverted the deletions i made on the above page while im definitely not for censorship that whole chunk needs to be referenced because it sure sounds and looks like a pov not facts if you can ref credible sources im ok for leaving it there with more neutral wording im not for either side just need to be neutral and factual thanks 
 we definitely need to have some critical coverage in the article i am aware that it needs better referencing i have suggested to its original author that he try to find some references and he also recognises the need for this 
 lol i cant believe that people are still interested in this it all seems a bit well silly i would have liked to have seen them use the mediawiki software as a platform for collaborative art rather than focus on an aspect that seems to be little more than a provocation or a stunt with no obvious actual artwork resulting i know a lot of great artists have enjoyed pulling stunts but it takes more than a few stunts to be be a great artist i guess i should be seeing this more in a performance art context where the nature of the actual artwork can be elusive if it is on the wall of an actual art gallery then i can hardly say it isnt art without sounding like one of the twits who complained about carl andre and i wouldnt want that it will be interesting to hear what other people make of it no promises but i might try to drop by the gallery myself and see it all in context 
 while 
 thanks wasnt aware of that 
 do you think 
 i think 
 based upon recent discussions in several places i have begun work on an essay that seeks to clarify just how and when discussuion of a filmbeforeitsfilming would per policy merit inclusion in some manner or per gng even merit a seperate article please look over 
 im pretty much with you and like the fact that you highlight that these articles should be a rare exception maybe you could put something in there about seeking consensus prior to split not really related to your essay but a couple of opinions i have is that i think future film is a better disambiguator than film project and i dont see why future film articles should be treated any differently than film articles 
 you didnt leave an edit summary to so i am really at a loss is there a reason for this revert wasnt the film 
 the article is at 
 oh it was moved this morning reverted 
 you got me worried as after i saw the article was renamed i went and renamed it in many other articles so i thought maybe you had a source to the contrary no harm done cheers 
 the process wonkism to overturn the afd decision of 
 in the previous paragraph i changed 
 hi i just made some new changes to 
 nice work on the filmography hopefully some of the stubs can be expanded too 
 re your edit to 
 yeah was a bit stumped with that one it was part of a larger change for listed buildings and other buildings that were listed as being in east sussex but are in fact in brighton and hove but i appreciate that there are not enough windmills in brighton and hove to make a category in order to be factually correct as brighton falls within the 
 we already have 
 except for the fact that hove is in brighton and hove and not east sussex no but im not going to be too pedantic on this one as its not a big deal 
 btw brighton falls under the historical county of 
 no actually although brighton used to be in east sussex it falls in the historic county of sussex east sussex is not a historic county 
 just checked if the mill was built in N then it was built in the county of sussex although divided the county had not yet officially been split into two counties 
 and i make it that there are three windmills in brighton and hove i reckon we should have a category for that 
 i have given hassocksN a shout lets see what he says i still think three is too low a number to justify a separate category there are several demolished windmills which could have articles written about them which would fit in this category but they are not high on my current to do list 
 as i said its not really the windmills i was concerned about there were some glaring inconsistencies within the different grades of listed buildings and i was trying to sort out what i could when i came across something else that said east sussex in brighton and hove i tried to change that too still some work to do but hopefully the integrity of the hierarchy structure of the categories and subcategories is maintained 
 hello you may be interested in 
 like on my user page ok 
 what do you mean by this 
 nevermind i misread the as thought you were just changing the curly quotes to straight ones 
 welcome to wikipedia im happy to answer any questions you have about the site 
 uN having thought about this for quite a while im still undecided a category for windmills in sussex would not be appropriate which leaves the possibility of creating a windmills in brighton and hove categoryuN which has some merit although the windmills were classified as being in sussex or east sussex until recently a b and h category would be consistent with categories such as churches listed buildings etc in brighton and hove admittedly it would be a small category perhaps the only other possible entry would be 
 looking at this further i suppose we should be consistent with 
 im leaning towards against a 
 im not suggesting we rewrite those lists merely that the category should reflect the lists to some extent but do i take it we are all in favour of creating a 
 this looks like a reasonable outcome thanks to both for making these changes 
 also if you can read french the 
 maybe the jospin discussion page is the more appropriate one to discuss this issue im still a newbie 
 i should have thought of that category myself somehow i didnt 
 its amazing how much falls under culture i predict subcategories there eventually 
 judging by the edit conflict notices im getting it looks like we are both stubsorting on the same turf so i will leave you to it for the moment i should be in bed and i agree with your choices anyway o 
 oh pardon me i guess im not the only one who stubsorts when i should be sleeping see ya 
 hi i see he just removed all the warning templates again is it worth semiprotecting the page adn or or increasing the length of the block 
 already done 
 as i can now see i thoughtd you were probably doing it as i typed but always worth the occasional prompting especially as im guessing you are rather busy on wikipedia 
 see 
 a synopsis and a logo do not a film make but guidelines are there for a reason maybe have another look at 
 if you look at the bafta website you will see that what wwwimdbcom calls N awards bafta calls N awards you will see that this extends every year the winners are shown on the bafta site in bold compare with the reason for the confusion is that bafta gives awards for the best drama series in N in april N my understanding is that wikipedia does not consider imdb a reliable source clearly this issue is much larger than just the article on 
 your argument is sound maybe all the bafta pages should be moved back a year to match the bafta website do you want to request moves for these some undertaking though i guess i was lazily going for internal consistency 
 although im confused as the seem to be correct by your reasoning above these would be the N awards maybe this needs closer scrutiny 
 okay seems to be some inconsistency on the bafta website however i think the imdb have it right when you search the bafta website it shows the nominations from the previous year ie N nominations N awards 
 or thank you for voting at 
 i recommend the library i guarantee that a university library would have a book or two or three on the cultural effects of the cold war from those books you can write about the larger themes rather than just list individual cultural products discussion of cold war culture can then integrate the good list of shows and books and movies you have got already and mdash 
 okayso i did some searching found some stuff what i found is right there on the cold war page i havent read any of the sources though does that matter would i just put that list of things at the bottom of the culture of the cold war article also would i repeat some of the sources found on other pages for example the musical 
 the most current citing system is called citephp you can read about that at 
 somehow you have flown under my radar as a portlandarea wikipedian but now that i have found you are you interested in 
 im assuming the meetup will be on a weekend thats the day its been the last two times and thats a yes im driving up unless my wife decides we should take the train 
 could you please see 
 i will look into it and mdash 
 it seems that you added a copyright violation id be interested to hear what happened thanks 
 looks like it was added over two years ago within a month or so of my first starting to edit wikipedia if i recall correctly the text didnt come directly from britannica but by way of which is the first thing that comes up on a google search for hammon good catch thanks and mdash 
 i appreciate your frustration but if the means to an end language isnt something you are particularly invested in then perhaps it would go further to facilitate a solution if we didnt make that a bone of contention 
 im not trying to make means to ends a sticking point but i am concerned about not being allowed to use strategy in the intro the means to ends language is a subordinate concern to strategy as its the definition of strategy as you know steve has argued that strategy and its definition belong in the intro because strategy is political or a code word i dont think its a supportable idea to remove strategy from the definition of geostrategy because steve views its use as in bad faith and mdash 
 the euripides page has spitefully been changed to this phony bce or ce system i will revert it 
 uN 
 the timeline is screwy now his visit to the caravan was before the assignment of the pong project likewise the claim of seeing a tennis game in the N s is a much more recent claim and directly contradicts both ted dabneys and al alcorns statements that it came from the magnavox odyssey the current writing gives it way to much weight in light of that 
 i wasnt saying to omit it rather it needs to be presented in a neutral manner rather than defacto history the alcorn interview already being used in the article states what i was saying as well and nolan got the idea from that but its like the movie the producers because he figured wed rip off the idea for a game but so what its no good we are not going to sell it we will throw it away so what harm is there right so it didnt work out that wayuN they sent us a letter theres also the ted dabney podcast interview 
 i wont game N rr thats why i have withdrawn for now i dont know what the proper way to go is perhaps im following my heart and my instincts a bit too much perhaps i just need to go to bed right now what i know for sure is that they annoy the living daylights out of me 
 it would probably be the same village pump daughter where 
 i recently created some pages for 
 by the way do you believe great powers should mention the fact that they are great powers in the lead of their country articles 
 i say these things because i have been quite disenchanted recently being in the thick of a N + month long edit dispute with another user on an ir subject who openly admits to never having read anything about the subject but who nonetheless feels qualified to rewrite the intro text to redefine the subject matter how they see fit its absurd and maddening so in your endeavor which i would be happy to support (although 
 theres nothing wrong with the article being chopped down and drastic changes being undertaken i just think the concept is worth staying on wikipedia as an article thus blanking half the page is better than deleting because the other half is worth keeping anyway whats your view on articles like 
 i could go on but i hope you get the point the articles in concept are inherently flawed we cannot just keep the namespace and redo the articles without or because the very concept of the article is based on a subjective assumption about how the future will turn out and mdash 
 i agree with you for the most part anyone is allowed to add anything on these articles as long as they demonstrate power its just that i believe that the articles can be salvaged and have developed a better series of headings in my userspace which may set the foundations for such an improvement to the articles so on that front we will agree to disagree but i do agree that the current article is or and is too much primarysource based uN 
 about your rational for deletion why dont you put your criticism in thies articlesit seems to me that their place are therei meanpeopol that asuem this and that about the future would have less chance to read this critisism if the articles are indeed deleted see it like the article on creationism or flat earthyes they are very hum theories but they do the job in informing peopolin that sence evenjapan superpower deservers an articlesaying something like you saidor maybe an article like creationevolution controversy 
 anyway you won N keep votes were discounted making it a resounding delete result uN 
 its not over yet 
 not directly however the foundation is big enough to negotate a pretty good deal with any one of N tshirt makers 
 it doesnt matter if the concept is new or in flux wikipedia does not aim to write the truth about a topic it aims to represent all published reputable positions on all sides of an issue without favoring one or the other or presenting something as settled the article should not be written and then sourcedthats getting the entire concept backwards it should find its genesis in the sourcesbuild up from that base as such most of the article should be fundamentally rewritten starting from actual sources rather than the musings of random people who happen to have wikipedia user accounts and mdash 
 do you prefer to be called haunted angel or would you rather me address you by your first name whatever it is just call me nevilledad lol 
 if you go on my page there should be a link to some useless personal crap says there my name is richard call me that if you want i dont mind uN 
 thats the latest thing gralo and myself have apparently agreed upon i think it will suffice nicely once we get the expert opinion sources put in plus it will allow us to keep a definition for the states that fall underneath the energy superpower (see 
 potential is less problematic than emerging because the former has implications of supported fact whereas the latter is hypothetical any section on potential powers ought to a stress the hypothetical or speculative nature of section and b base everything on the secondary sources saying that a country does or does not have such potential and arefrain from marshaling primary source or raw data on behalf of or against such claims above all wikipedia must not have its own theory or its own position on these countries and their potential we must reflect the ideas of others but thats as far as it goes and mdash 
 i removed some yearonly links per 
 woops totally my fault i was using vandal proof and must have given your edit an underdeserved look and mistakenly deemed it vandalism i have removed the template from your talk page and you have my apologies uN 
 the word alleged isnt unecyclopedic it was its usage alleged specific it sounds startlingly like an oxymoron 
 agreed 
 ok alleged specific is no good true what about specific allegations seeing as thats what they are and some of them are manifestly not instances of secularization seeing as they never happened although the allegation did 
 b if wikipedia is not out to present the truth but merely all published reputable positions of an issue without favoring one side then what are we going to do should somebody from exxon mobil come in and quote a reputable source they hired to contradict the other scientists quoted on the global warming article we have this issue on the energy superpower page too because i have had a number of editors advancing arguments all over the place about russian energy policies how on earth do editors like gralo xdamr beagel and myself make certain that this article doesnt dissolve into a bout of pro and antirussian wikilobbying 
 wikilobbying is certainly a problem the key is to make sure the sources are attributed in the text so that the readers knows whose opinion they are receiving so rather than having a statement like russia is the greatest energy power we should make sure that sentences like that are rewritten to say ivan denisovitch from the all russian energy promotion institute writes in a N white paper that russia is the greatest energy power then present other sourced items saying more moderate things the bbc reports that russias energy production positions it in xyz way regarding the international market the doe says abc about russian energy production etc within the context of multiple sources the extent of the controversy will become clear to the reader and they can choose on their own which sources they agree with and mdash 
 i wrote on the talk page about the need for a criticisms section to address the many critical views of the term great power like you have suggested i also added a placeholder subsection on the main article page where sourced criticism can be added and mdash 
 hi there i invite you to ask a mod or admin to tell me or you to show me where on wikipedia it says that a reference cannot have multiple sources instead of continuing reverting you are the only editor that keeps reverting it so you must think that this is a rule when it isnt if you choose to protect the article i will ask the mod or admin to give me a reasonable explanation and or or make an account and continue including the sourced uncharted numbers thanks 
 replied on the users talk page 
 my mistake i was in haste in removing it as i thought that you were readding something that the user had previously removed im not accustomed to edit summaries for user talk pages which somehow led me to think that you had previously added the same section in any case though i have been told by a couple of admins that they have the right to remove warnings the removal indicates that the message has been seen and that the page history can be viewed to determine any issues i have seen a few legitimate editors remove warnings to their talk pages or just blank their talk page entirely with no interest in keeping the discussion so while i acknowledge my revert was a misunderstanding can you tell me what is the proper way to handle issues heres a couple of instances where my headsup messages were reverted and itd be nice to know if i can after all force warnings to be kept on user talk pages of disruptive editors uN 
 well if i were to be nominated for bureaucratship for example people would want to know what i have been up to and what disputes i have been involved in they could certainly go through the history of my talk page editbyedit to find everything but it would be much more convenient if all the content was still there this is why deleting talk page content is counterproductive people will want to know about that N rr block on me removing it from my talk page makes it look like im trying to hide something in general theres no reason nor advantage to be gained from removing things from your talk page remember wikipedia is not made of paper we have plenty of space and your talk page can get very very lengthy the best solution for those wanting to start fresh on their talk page is to simply archive the contents which is something that i have done for my talk page the guideline on user pages has a helpful explanation 
 the only reason i reverted it was because it was a drastic despcrption change without a source if you feel that fulgrim slew ferrus go ahead and change it to that if not we will wait until the book fulgrim is released uN 
 no worries though you could always tag it with a citation needed rather than revert 
 i suppose thats true although im always very wary of leaving unsourced info up uN 
 the ram being changed to rahm im cool with i can even understand that but the band till especially specificly pronounce it shtine rather then the many things i have seen over the years so if you must change it to the latter of the two examples you gave uN 
 well you see the problem lies in the fact that shtine can be pronounced in several different ways id prefer caps used instead since that seems to be a rather popular formatting style in most dictionaries that dont use ipa for their pronunciation guidelines 
 minor addition but for example look at the article on 
 im not sure how shtine could be pronounced differently but itd be a tad ignorant of me to say that i think with jpeg though because j is just a singular letter itd be more easy to get confused hence the caps uN 
 well words ending in ine can be pronounced as both or ain or nine and or in or mezzanine so thats still possible 
 ah well you seem to know what you mean so i will take your word for it uN 
 a note on my talk page would have been nice ive been handling seven mediations of my own and why would you base an editorial judgement on my inactivity or appearance thereof 
 if you are going to be involved in a mediation one might reasonably expect you to check in on it at least once a week you were making edits on a variety of pages every day over the past three weeks there was clearly little restraint on your available time essentially you were ignoring the rfm meanwhile i had one question for you five weeks ago which you have ignored several times now its disrespectful since you are the one who is demanding changes to the article text it is incumbent upon you when disagreed with to give some sort of explanation other than flippant oneliners why your changes are necessary there is no reason why the article should reflect misleading personal opinion while you ignore the rfm for weeks at a time with no notice and mdash 
 it was poorly referenced and promotional 
 i have no opinion on if it should stay or go but if you feel strongly afd is probably the way to go now 
 as far as i know if you tag something with prod or afd the notice stays until the timeperiod for consideration is up maybe im wrong but anons removing a prod tag without an edit summary smacks more of trying to protect the page by deleting things rather than a good faith effort to allow process to take its course and mdash 
 what you say i believe applies to 
 because the removals of the prod tag were edit summaryless i did not consider them at the time to be contesting the prod tag formally but merely engaging in the kind of processflouting that anons often do as such i will look into filing it for afd and mdash 
 hi paul after receiving no answer from silsor and being quite rudely ignored by arminius about the permanent blocking of gnaa popeye i have eventually written this 
 hi sam im not sure yet exactly what involvement i want to have in all this i do think the issue of possible abuse of administrator blocking powers is an important and serious matter as well as a possible attempt to stifle unpopular speech its also quite easy for me to imagine that gnaa popeye might have done things which would warrant an indefinite block i have asked silsor on his talk page to please explain to me the reasons and grounds for the block we will see where that leads regards 
 thanks paul silsor has now answered on the rfc page and i have good hopes that he will answer the real questions regards 
 well unfortunately i have to withdraw that quoting him i dont feel i need to defend myself any further as this rfc will be deleted in about N hours 
 thanks for the very thoughtful post you made on 
 regarding my semicolon box and mdash absolutely im sure you realize that nothing is mine on wikipedia in fact i stole some of my boxes from other users anyway you are more than welcome to use it or to create a 
 listen i need your help and advice 
 alright i took your advice in working solo in episode articles now im having a bit of trouble looking for some reviews for two episodes btw im working on will and grace related stuff anyways i was wondering if you can help with looking for some reviews now the advice i just finished

 sure email me with your address and i will give you my cell phone 
 what do you think im not sure that an article about an antipope is really about the papacy although in a broad loose sense i suppose it is the wording papacyrelated sounds a little awkward but not too bad and is probably more accurate if you have any ideas please let me know cheers 
 update and mdash you are probably not passionately interested in whether it says pope or antipope but since you were asking chooserr not to keep reverting the pope stub template back to the general stub template i thought i should let you know that the was undeleted last night i hope there isnt going to be a wheel war in any case i dont think there was consensus for deletion see for the last evidence of comments before that subject was removed from 
 i dont know if anyone has done a comparative study of the curricula of religious schools in the islamic jewish and eastern and western christian traditions 
 please note that there is a dc meetup planned for may N th at N pm though a place has not yet been set you are receiving this notice because you posted to the page for the prior meetup 
 i really dont want to translate that flame they are all involved and i dont have the will to determine who is more guilty i told them they are on all final warning and we will be blocking them for any future flaming 
 i wrote only in him discussion that i will withdraw his nationalist polish pov but ip uses true personal attacks nazi man nut trash man i wait on blockade this ip 
 after reading your comments i believe that it would be wise to put up a list like you said talking about the hormones and a note about the possible out comes of break up and such but i was hoping youd do it because N it would probably be a bit more neutral and N any edits i make will most certainly be reverted instantly 
 true but my concerns rest not just with enforcement but with the serious civility problems inherent in the current process as well im attempting to compile an 
 the poll is now open please see 
 im still really interested in the church and religion in general as a matter of history and as a window into the human mind and also to continue studying how and why i used to believe in it fervently as you know there are aspects of it that im critical of but i also take pains to correct people when they are unfair or incorrect in criticizing the church i think and hope my edits on churchrelated articles have reflected that interest in fairness and accuracy 
 who was your kirtland family i have much ancestry from the area as well 
 i will look at 
 im not going to revert it again but it is wrong of him to censor me i am reply to a comment how would you like it if someone removed one of your statements for no reason im not telling anyone to go to hell just stating that i find it odd that one person would join a religion and flatly ignore the doctrine furthermore im now accused of vandalism 
 i gave usercolle an example of what he is doingit is the same thing as me reverting jzgs comment about masturbation and N per cent of the population doing it i find that down right offesive but i can walk by it should i go there and revert that edit would that be right what if i get rid of his comments on fundamentalists vs conservatives is that right that offends me 
 thank you 
 please be advised that planning is now underway (see 
 check out the new things that the smithsonian is offering us 
 is there any way that you can firm up your plans we would like to include you in our count for dinner thanks 
 heres whats going on an editor appears to have deleted several threads outright miszabot then archived which the same editor undid two edits later i restored the archival but then noticed the additional missing threads and restored them my intent was to remove the threads that miszabot did indeed archive and i had removed two when you reverted me is there a better way to fix this issue thanks in advance 
 agreed i have inquired about their intent though im not sure what excuse there would be for such an extensive removal 
 no problem at all as you say we probably both did the same thing at the same time im going to go in and delete the threads that did get copied over to the archives but the version from here on out should have everything from before the removal thanks 
 i have removed at least a dozen threads that i can confirm were properly copied im sure i missed a few but worst case scenario miszabot can catch them on the next run thanks again 
 hey the final date and time for the first workshop has been set if you want to sign up for the team check out 
 dont feel obliged to but if you feel comfortable with the material on the workshop outline you will be fine as an instructor now on the other hand if you dont feel you can answer a good swath of questions on 
 i did want to know if youd look over hipocrites three revert violation i posted it on the N rvt violation page but no one is paying attention to it also could you look over 
 you are right i shouldnt have done that if you havent fixed it by now i will go back and do it 
 why are you not doing anything this is ridiculous 
 sorry im just getting frustrated the guy is taking on several hostile pov edit campaigns at once inserting things that can only be described as vandalism this is wasting so much time from so many editors here not to mention it is frustrating and demoralising 
 i see you deleted 
 please respond to this post 
 yeah no problem 
 thanks mate uploaded it 
 dreadstar couldnt count that day gives the best summary of it i can give in short dreadstar counted an edit as a revert that was not and treated constructive editing as edit warring 
 thats fine then though i will kindly remind you that rollback is for vandalism reverting only although i dont think i need to tell you that thanks for the explanation 
 i have to vent somewhere prolick removed our comments today and then altered a section based on my removed comment besides which our comments on his talk page have been altered or removed anyways im done venting now 
 agreed peoples talk pages are their own territory after all but the abortion page its not good to remove comments on a heated debateanyways i know to look for those source only sections now in there 
 please note this is an automatic notification by a

 how are you today i havent been on much lately and i hope to start back to my editing soon

 uN 
 if i may ask why do you believe this should be captialized 
 for the same reason the us army does if none other the capitalization is in the original source and should carried forward as an accurate representation of the sourcing uN 
 i completely agree that we should carry the appropriate title across thats one of the reasons i have been making so many edits to them because many do not have the accurate information but i do not agree that the capitalization must remain the same using the same logic if the whole title was in caps we would not leave it that way and i have been told by several that it is not necessary to maintain the capitalization of the reference title just the title itself a prime example is the individual names on the medal of honor website i previously reported them as caps in the citation because thats the way it is in the website and was told by at least three other editors that maintaing the caps was not necessary and it was in fact preferred to use natural capitalization for citations because its easier for some readers or editors to read do you have a wp guidline policy rule etc that states that we should maintain the caps it states here 
 well i have honestly never come across this situation before in all the articles i watch i have never had anybody change the capitalization from the original i think 
 thats totally fine and fair by me

 loads of love to 
 i have never filed an rfc and thus i would also be a firsttimer 
 im keeping in mind the rfc angle as well especially now that prolick is going wild on the abc hypothesis section or article after doing some preliminary googling 
 i know exactly how you feel its frustrating you feel powerless to act because everyone else is sitting on their hands i have had similar experiences with N and more recently g and e you are also the first person to describe me as patient not pursuing an rfc until this point has been less an issue of patience and more one of desiring not to rock the boat i daresay i wouldnt be confident enough to go through with it unless i had multiple user support

 many thanks for your appreciation 
 thanks 
 thanks for informing will look into it 
 thanks for the offer to join your new wikiproject i was kinda surprised because my only related edit was undoing a piece of vandalism on the coheed and cambria article funnily enough i was proud enough of that edit to tell my brother about it when i last spoke to him well thanks anyway cheers 
 no problem i saw you revert a load of vandalism so i thought you would be interested uN 
 i removed it because not only was it vague and confusing but also unwikified theres no need to be so aggresive about this i never claimed to own wikipedia uN 
 thanks for contributing and improving 
 thank you 
 this is a request that you follow official policy and synthesize the sources as opposed to voting for them judging them and arguing for and against them consensus is not determining article content it is made clear on the policy pages that article content standards are 
 ok im already on record saying that its not our job to make definitions of our own rather we are supposed to find definitions with reliable sources sometimes combining them to make for a more comprehensive balanced and accurate synthesis the problem here is that some definitions are incomplete making sense in context but not when plucked out and other definitions disagree on the specifics of how to phrase the same concept obviously the key issue right now is death which some definitions use and others do not i dont see how voting is particularly helpful except to gauge the amount of agreement that exists 
 prolick i havent once suggested basing article content on any kind of vote i agree with alienus statement above about the purpose of polling to gauge the amount of agreement that exists as well as to generate clear statements of reasons as for asking me not to judge or argue for or against sources no thats silly synthesizing sources involves critical analysis you would do better to use your mind more instead of asking others to use theirs less 
 yet you insist upon consensus in the group before changes consensus of what am i misunderstanding something is donanobispacems insistence along with several others ongoing repitition that it must be talked and consensus reached referring to their desire to comply with 
 today i have got a lot of nonwiki work to do i will try to summarize the state of the death argument when im done with my grading in a day or two if it still seems worth it

 the last onehundred or so of your contributions have been laden with the edit summary redirecting the title over to intended merge target to carry out afd result im guessing that if anything was worth merging it most likely would have been done by now i do not think that this is helpful at all to the encyclopedia particularly when there is a talkpage notice on the target articles using that tell you to perform the merge if it hasnt been completed already i think its much healthier to assume the content hasnt been merged at all check whether it has by looking for the content on the target article and to at least try to perform it yourself save the attribution history and the article content and speaking of attribution youuN ve forgot to document any related merges by using on the related redirects and or or use on the talkpages of the target articles to note the merges involved you really should read 
 this is old stuff that im cleaning up going through the backlog of old afd merges this is stuff that has fallen through the cracks and the material contains nothing that i can merge and still maintain verifiability 
 so did you in fact not merge the content from 
 done results at 
 any comments on 
 hey this is quite weird i have asked for 
 i have found that a lot of good articles and probably a lot of featured articles are abusing the use of copyrighted images on wikipedia would you be interested in helping fix this problem 
 well im not necessarily looking for people to help just wipe away half of the images i mean if an article has a good reason like in 
 no problemo thanks for the comments 
 please see 
 are reversions the worst thing perhaps perhaps not i had already decided good could get the last rv in just for nostalgic purposes 
 grumpy or not you are good people d 
 if not i guess i could get a screenshot from chandni or tiranga assuming that it is acceptable his being dead and all 
 id go the second option to get a noncostumed image from a film screenshot and a frontal image 
 i have sent an email to the nsd lets see how they respond 
 just added N to first paragraph discussion 
 andrew c saw this as a split looks better than repetition imo 
 i need to have jerry eckwood added to the list of arkansas razorback players how do i do this 
 i searched for the article but couldnt find it unless its a table its relatively simple just clicking edit this page at the top and find the place it needs to go amongst the coding again if its a table it can be a bit awkward its best if you give me a link to the article you wish to add it to as i had trouble finding it and i will add it in and show you afterwards how exactly it was done im sure you know that to provide the link simply type 
 again see the edit at the bottom uN 
 thank you 
 thank you for pointing out it was removed from the article due to erroneous albeit 
 the only problem i can see on this page is the flag which i have removed stop removing image and changing format 
 okay i will compromise as you have left the rest of the page per the mos i will leave the image in place 
 fair enough on a serious one though why do you always remove the picture i think it has its uses 
 im not sure id agree its obvious that there isnt a proper image of the player and that one needs to be included and just serves to push actual information about the player further down the page however its not the biggest thing to get worried about and its not mentioned in any policies however the flags and the italicising of loan is mentioned in various policies which is why when i see it in an article i remove it the process i go through is copying the blank template syntax from and then copying all of the information from the article into the new template then delete the old can we try to put any previous disagreements behind us im trying to do the same thing as you on wikipedia increase the amount of footballrelated info its not me that sets the policies about format or about which articles should be included they are set by the community as a whole and im just applying them 
 i agree its not a proper image but for people who may have a photo of said player and are not that up to speed with wikipedia can find out how to add it thus making the page better in the long run with regards to the flags fair enough i can really moan about that but messing with the template is petty is there really any need for all that space it looks stupid i am willing to forgive and forget but try to stop messing around with thing that dont need messing with 
 best regards 
 thanks 
 hello ekabhishek this is a message from an 
 mistake i didnt create the article though made some edits in the past as for the csd it seems to have been resolved already 
 if you like astrology then you might see be interested in these topics https or or securewikimediaorg or wikipedia or en or wiki or user_talkindu_#muhurtaN c_rahukalN c_chaugadia 
 please avoid posting such random links thanks 
 sorry for the trouble i dont get much time for editing and also didnt see much progress in the rahukaalams and muhurtas pages so i thought about posting links to people 
 to get people to your favorite articles simply take time and make them interesting it can even become a 
 are you really saying that you support monicasdudes accusations of racism 
 i dont know would you like me to say that would that help 
 it is too complex for me i will try and find someone who can do may be some irani or arab because this text is probabaly farsi or arabi 
 thanks an iranian user too found the calligraphy tough lets see 
 whats up is your completely inexplicable backing of trolls like monicasdude and pov warriors like deecevoice 
 zoe disagreeing with you doesnt make someone a troll i strongly disagree with monicasdude also and think that she is much too quick to accuse people of vandalism or bad faith sometimes makes keep arguments that are counter to guidelines but none of that makes her a troll monicasdude is a strong inclusionist acting in good faith not a troll please 
 im sorry i have to strongly disagree with you joshua that monicasdude is acting in good faith good faith does not remove prod tags on flimsy reasoning and then accuse others of bad faith for bringing the article to afd which is what is supposed to be done good faith does not involve accusing everybody who disagrees with you of being a vandal and a racist bacchus about your comments on my talk page admins are not supposed to be anything more than another editor according to the rules of adminship so theres nothing anywhere that makes me a role model im an editor who wants to follow the policies of wikipedia and when those policies are ignored in fact flouted then theres something wrong with whats going on and something needs to be done but if everybody just looks away then where are we why do we have policies if they can be ignored just because a minority of voters on an afd or drv can decide to ignore them 
 stop distorting my comments zoe i have commented repeatedly on structural bias and institutional insensivity on wikipedia not accused individual users of racism you keep fitting yourself for a hood and insisting that i forced it on you as somebody said methinks the lady doth protest too much 
 you will have to pardon me for leaving this on your talk page gtb but i cannot leave a message on mds talkpage without it being uncivilly deleted monicasdude if you have ever wondered why the whole world seems to be after you i offer you this solution perhaps it could be that you are in the wrong here i know how easy it is to have a persecution complex you have one without even realizing it that you accuse innocent editors of hounding you and distorting what you have to say is symptomatic in my mind of your approach to wikipedias community policy and your efforts to twist them to punish other editors while ignoring the fact that you fly in the face of what is civil or even appropriate 
 given that there are at least six comments from you on my talk page right now your statement that i delete all your comments is a clear example of distortion methinks the laddy doth protest too much 
 given that if you look at your history you have deleted no fewer than four instances of my comments on your page critical of you but by no means even toeing the line on being out of bounds in civility your claims of distortion are not as stable as you assert note also that i have neither been uncivil to you nor deleted your comments on my talk page even though by your rationale i could do so willynilly i personally think of it as an immensely disrespectful thing to do to another editor 
 thank you 
 image restored was removed due to good faith erroneous edit hence template removed thanks 
 this wasnt an edit dispute the user is question added his personal fansite his personal myspace and a fan petition to this article the article for the remake and vincent donofrios article 
 and when i warned him he added bogus tags on my talk page 
 alright i will inform him of this but im not going to block unless he continues 
 thanks much 
 you might like to go through 
 ps you received these suggestions because your name was listed on 
 awesome cheers p uN 
 its true i did go through a huge purge of the south park episodes removing trivia however i never once went and deleted all trivia from all episodes whenever i have deleted trivia i have done so in order to remove stuff which is either unproven irrelevant useless or something which doesnt even deserve mention as such more times then not i have left bits of trivia about to be integrated into the article later the stuff i removed were bits that would have no place in the article what remained in the trivia sections i aimed to merge into other parts of the article later after i have removed the first level of cruft uN 
 no worries uN

 compare http or or wwwlibvirginiaedu or clemons or rmc or exhib or N rayaa or elementshtml which is one of the articles deeceevice uses as proof of her claims against what she says in the article it says and you will see shes putting her own spin on things i have said all along that there should be an article about the robert farris thompson book she uses as supporting documentation but it shouldnt be used as the sole proof of her allegation 
 also see coyeps arguments at

 to theoldanarchist i have no good defense i did it out of N anger N not understanding how the process works at first i didnt know how to add comments im still not sure exactly how as for changing your post i apologise to you please forgive me it was wrong it made me angry that you referred to my imput as vandalism personnally i still believe what tom said about where he was born however i shall refrain from editing that point i wish you well once again please accept my apology 
 thanks ed apology accepted i do not wish to take up any more space on bacchus talk page so lets just consider the matter settled i think we both acted out of anger at least a little which rarely has a positive result 
 as a reminder yes all claims must be supported by inline citations 
 i wonder whether using 
 i really dont understand why some editors are so bent on damaging wikipedia and treating it as a game with a rule book instead of having a genuine desire to improve articles i guess its the usual human nature anyway im restoring the images for now lets see whether the destructive rulemongers will continue to wear out the patience of everyone else 
 you have an admirable attitude thanks its just frustrating when some editors seem less interested in improving wikipedia than in making others conform to various rules (which the guidelines are 
 the other thing that i noted in my administrator or vandalism note is that the user has at least two sockpuppets who have spammed with the same links before see at the time i gave spam warnings to those usernames as well 
 thank you for the information 
 the accounts involved have been tagged 
 i have also discovered that you can do it by ticking the top box then holding down shift and ticking the bottom one then unticking whichever one you want to im not sure if it works in all browsers though 
 ps and mdash have just seen that someone else was answering your query i think the 
 you are welcome its worth restoring i will find sources to support it 
 many thanks you are generous though the user is at it again 
 whats that move to or bad about 
 exactly what i was going to ask and mdash 
 there was an edit with someones personal info and i was getting rid of it at a different location so its less likely to be accidentally undeleted or even seen later maybe i should have mentioned it on the talk page but i was trying to call less attention to the personal info not more it should be clear from what i was doing anyway 
 oh i get it now theres

 both pages have their legions of povpushers standing guard over them to stop anything remotely npov to be added in the fact that they wont even accept a template pointing out the fact that page lacks a worldview speaks volumes for the antics there the fact that they dont tolerate editing wont tolerate international information being added in and wont tolerate templates to my mind defines the individuals responsible as pov vandals frankly if pages remain at dunce level for so long because of the appalling level of inaccuracy in them and a group of pov pushers prevent the pages being edited except by them then the pages might as well be deleted they are of no value to wikipedia and just undermine its credibility people wouldnt tolerate just antics elsewhere users are regularly blocked and banned for it but prolife and prochoice have become such pains in the backside that most people just avoid the pages like the plague 
 my suggestion jtdirl is that you tone down your disgust and hostility and instead join us in harmonious editing 
 uN 
 thanks 
 but i have explained repeatedly and been ignored on the rare occasions al deigns to discuss things it is to assume the prochoice pope position that users must convince him as though it is his article and he can vet other peoples contributions so he reverts to the version he wants deletes things he doesnt want and demands that he be convinced before things can go in it is up to him to justify the inaccurate mess that is his article and until he does some explaining for once rather than demanding everyone else do it the tags stay in 
 im willing to discuss but not willing to be bullied you really cant expect people to look upon you favorably when you consistently threaten to have them banned for no higher crime than disagreement as an admin you ought to know better 
 hi abhishek i want to add the english translation of the title uN fuN uN uN uN uN euN uN uN e uN fuN uN uN euN uN uN uN uN uN e to the bibliography of 
 hi hekerui was away and have added the english transliteration of the book title the title translates to one tune of mine one of the sarangi can we can add this since the book isnt a translation titlehope its ok good work with the article must add 
 thanks i asked because has the trans_title parameter so the translated english title can be inserted best regards 
 ok 
 on pages users disagree and discuss edits they dont delete chunks of text they dont delete links they dont delete factual information and they dont then delete tags inserted to say that the content is disputed users who do that are regularly blocked for such behaviour admins have let you away with things that they have blocked other users for elsewhere simply because it is the prochoice article and it and the prolife page both have a reputation as being the sort of place you dont touch with a barge pole in the past admins tried to enforce blocks on users highjacking the page on one day N people had to be blocked for the sort of antics you are up to in the end we all got fed up trying to do anything there apart from the odd joke about just deleting the damn pages altogether people simply avoid them like the plague your antics are typical of those pages they would not be tolerated at credible pages on wikipedia 
 it would be helpful if you offered something other than conspiracy theories your edits were repeatedly reverted because they were major changes that according to consensus made a radical pov shift in the article we have all tried repeatedly to get you to talk about your desired changes but you have been most uncooperative 
 we need your help in filling up the column of directors which you can get from http or or wwwcitwfcom or personN htm in the article 
 as much as i hate bugging people about stuff like this i felt compelled to now apparently an anon user put a speedydelete tag that was removed but the page was still deleted by an admin then promptly restored by another admin and protected the page is now being sorted out on 
 thanks for the warning i admit i made roughly the same comment to the handful of people who voted with me on that page next time i will be careful the reason i felt worried now is that because the page is frozen it took me reading the talk page discussion between gina and someone else to realize what was going on oddly enough the italian peppers page appears to have demonstrated that an article can be created

 i understand that the situation had pretty much resolved itself but i hope you werent referring to me as a troll i would like to know if i was doing something wrong sorry for any misunderstanding 
 um no not remotely nor did i remove your comment the edit summary was remove troll and i was removing a trolling comment from a banned user 
 ah now i see i cant find the diff that i thought showed a yellow box with my commenti must need a nap thanks for bearing with me 
 thank you 
 thanks 
 what is your exact stand on userboxes regardless of where the code is stored before transclusion or substitutionuN 
 perhaps thats a longer answer than you were hoping for 
 i understand your arguement about politics and being a teacher however i have had teachers who were very open about their beliefs and it did not effect their teaching i believe that the same can be true of an encyclopedia so long as no one tries editing articles that only show their belief uN 
 again with the teacher example yeah i could see a good teacher being open about their politics i have had those teachers too i still think campaign buttons or tshirts would be inappropriate attire in the classroom thus im super okay with people revearing their biases here but i think user boxes are a cruddy way to do it 
 i wouldnt chastise myself too harshly for a typo i am mixed on the whole catagories thing it can be used for good reasons but it also permits less desireable actions lastly i find campaign buttons somewhat tacky no matter the circumstances but i dont find userboxes tackyuN provided they arent ugly uN

 thank you for your words and would love to take on 
 welcome aboard have posted some links theyd help feel free to ask any specific question about wiki thanks 
 many thanks you are kind 
 fyi see 
 hey id like to ask your advice about this fellow if you look here at his recent contibutions http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlespecialcontributions and targetwalterwalrusN you will see that he has created a series of articles with the names of different individuals and then redirected said articles to other articlesone gets the sense that this is clearly designed to disparage the individual named he created one article entitled mother fucking homosexxxualthis article is already gone he also redirected the sweeney disambiguation page to the incredible hulk articlei have already reverted this and posted a message on his user page on the matter in general though what should be done about this fellow as i say i would very much like to hear your thoughts 
 thanks for your quick response i had a feeling after seeing the previously mentioned mfh article that he may have posted some other nonsense so i thought i would check what puzzles me is that his previous contributions seem to have been legitimate then he suddenly goes off the deep end as it were again thanks 
 yesterday you undid an edit of mine (on the 
 hi fabiena the edit you made which deleted a reference a 
 hi murgh thank you for taking the time to explain now i understand what is coi and how you might have thought it was involved in this case for me a N article is dated for showing notoriety on the web but i suppose it is my opinion cheers 
 im having a bit of trouble tracking down the edit that you speak of could you point me in the right direction thanks 
 ah i think i see what happened i didnt see what you did because my page had loaded and there must have been only a second or so between your edit and my reversion feel free to revert back but thanks for checking first 
 it was simply that with no edit summary i thought it might not have been true and was just more patent nonsense nothing more 
 oh no please you wernt bothering me at all sorry if i made it seem that way 
 hi consider 
 ok i restored your ip block exempt status as it looks like procseebot randomly nabbed your underlying ip uN 
 thanks 
 thank you for improving on my article i was going to subdivide the article just as you have done anyway thanks 
 thanks 
 thanks all the best 
 thanks for your message on my talk page re my aiv report what exactly constitutes recent vandalism or an active vandal the editor i reported vandalized four hours ago and i was offline when it happened the user has vandalized the same article repeatedly and already been warned three times how soon after vandalism must a user be reported N minutes an hour it seems rather arbitrary to say that N hours is too long and N minutes is not its almost as though if someone did not catch the vandal right then and report them for it then it essentially did not happen and they cannot get in trouble for it if this person vandalizes again and i miss it and no one else reports it then they will be in the clear seems odd to me im no stranger to rving vandals and to aiv reports but if you could clarify the policy on active vandals i would appreciate it you can reply here or on my talk page thanks 
 what i meant by active to my standards has at the most vandalised within the last N minutes blocks are meant to prevent disprution to wikipedia the vandal you reported is inactive and blocking the vandal serves no purpose remember blocks are not punishments it is used to prevent disruption to wikipedia 
 the vandal i reported vandalized four times on june N th and before that many times on june N st you say they are inactive but by that same token i was inactive for the last few hours until i got back online i really dont think this is a very rational approach and im wondering if this is your interpretation of it or an official policy all admins follow in the meantime i guess i will just have to hope im not offline the next time this person vandalizes after their last warning 
 the N minute thing is just a rule i use for myself and of course its just a number usually i just apply common sense the vandal is not causing any immediate damage as of now so there is no reason to block him for that right now however if the user continues on this trend then i would consider a block but so far the user made N edit after he received his last warning and there has been no edit since then block serves no purpose because we do not know if the vandal will vandalise again or not in this case its very questionable if there is a solid proof that the user is a persistant vandal and when it comes unquestionable that there has been previous records of vandalism and the user is not stopping then it would be approperiate to block without giving a warning 
 had i reported him right after his last vandal edit would you have blocked him sorry for beating a dead horse but im really trying to understand this 
 assume if you actually reported him on time then yes it will probably get blocked however there is another factor which plays in if we make this assumption if you have caught him eailier and he was online at the time he would of caught that his edit has been reverted if he did not continue after the revert he may be blocked but if this is the case the block itself really has no other meaning than enforcing a period for the vandal to cool down if he goes on and continues to vandalise dispite you reverted his vandalism then he passes the line which a block to prevent disruption would be needed in either case the vandal is blocked however in this case we do not know if the vandal will stop or continue thats why i did not block but as i said if the vandal later on starts to show clear evidence of not stopping then that is when i will block 
 thanks that does explain it better though im still not sure i agree with this way of looking at but no matter i will leave it there except to add a thank your for all your work dealing with vandals best 
 any and all comments and suggestions are welcome thanks 
 i would suggest 
 thanks please contribute to an ongoing discussion over this 
 hello ekabhishek as you are one of the most active members of wp india i was wondering if youd review this article against the

 hiya im currently helping out with wikiconference india N just wondering if you can spare time to help out with the programming team cheers 
 hi atg congratulations on your efforts and my best wishes to the team 
 hey am bit confused the main article page says that it was the N st company to screen a film in an international film fest right but was it the pioneer in producing films in all these N languages or have the dyk guys just misread it 
 it was the first company to produce films in all four languages till then companies were usually restricted regionally 
 with 
 thanks shirt 
 the main issue is its not that id consider those cartoons profanity against my belief but it is clear from the article and the many cartoon removals that many people do as you might know the english wikipedia gets primarily written by christian american or british editors and muslim editors are a minority since you are an admin you can still look at 
 gtbacchus i would highly recommend you pay close attention to 
 dear tedickey i made a small edit to the geography section with inline references which was removed by another editor with a totally unreferenced edit i do not wish this to expand in any way would you please look at what i did i think it was a quite sound and appropriate edit and i am a little shocked to have it so cavalierly reversed by another editor thanks 
 i thought it was a bit long for the given context the wlink to 
 thanks for the input the text sentence itself wasnt much longer than the original the footnote ref was long because i figured people wouldnt have the proceedings of the wv constitution conv i should have used mcphersons battle cry of freedom instead which said pretty much the same thing as my edit the voters overwhelmingly endorsed a new state but the turnout was small pg N there is basically the only sentence on the southern united states page that deals with statehood and what is there now is just stuff not informative at all anyway i will drop the whole thing thanks 
 no problem 
 thats better 
 thanks 
 gtbacchus despite your best intentions if your goal is to improve wikipedia and not get tangled up in conflict i would highly recommend that you disassociate yourself from 
 your 
 having left this on the talk page for so long and had no disagreements i trust there will be no objections when i change it 
 just looking at the change i reverted something that made the old or new dates the same back to about N days difference looking now i see that the visual effect of the change made the years differ but not the date so i do agree with that will revert 
 hi i remember that you put forth your name as a friendly admin at 
 ps please delete the talk pages too and thanks again uN 
 could you please tell me how my external link was link spam thank you 
 looks like all you are doing is adding links to another encylopedia site spam according to most people 
 my understanding of the policy is that the question should be whether the external link adds additional helpful relevant information are you suggesting it doesnt or are you arguing that links to another encyclopedia site are by definition spam according to most people 
 your editing history shows that you made dozens of links no more than a minute apart its improbable that there waa any attempt to make constructive changes spam as noted before 
 do read a reliable source rather than interpreting rules according to your own preference for instance any of the state government sites will give the information 
 the edits are promotional and the site doesnt offer useful content to readers 
 is this your own words or are they someone elses polite dialogue moves mountains just grabbing a shovel and attacking the mountain makes you look like a hothead why invite conflict when you could invite cooperation read meatballwikicoldblanket please gtbacchus N N june N if they are your words i would like to ask you if i could put it on my userpage 
 thank you 
 it really annoys me when i have seen policy but no longer able to find it working families and other buzzwords have a name an ism name if i recall correctly and wikipedia is not a place for them the fact it is a buzzword or buzzterm afaik does deny noteability 
 are you thinking of the guideline 
 thats the one this page in a nutshell a new term doesnt belong in wikipedia unless there are reliable sources specifically about the term uN not just sources which mention it briefly or use it in passing so just to bring the term out of a straightdeletion it needs wprs articles discussing the term itself and its noteability not simply an article saying how much rudd has said it or an article with the term littered throughout which is not a case for noteworthyness 
 thats just my point timeshift this particular neologism did havereliable sources specifically about the term i remember for example reading a couple of crikey articles specifically discussing rudds use of the term and its significance to the campaign 
 those arguments would be valid at an afd but id like to see what the wider community has to say i tend to agree with hesperian that it should be reinstated and debated there 
 i would have no opposition to any admin doing so although i reserve the right to vote delete at the appropriate time 
 indeed melburnian having turned up that other page i believe i would vote merge 
 on the basis that you had no opposition to any admin restoring i have done so i think the recent debate with the swan putting all sorts of people into the scope of the term is hilarious and shows that it isnt a temporary phenomenon at all it has survived the election and will be a feature of at least this budget there are indeed many reliable sources about the term quoting the treasurers attempts to define it no less and not just in passing moreover the article was referenced please take the debate to afd if you want to but speedy in my view was not appropriate for this article 
 i have no objection to a merger 
 have a good one 
 thanks 
 gawd as mine creeps too close never said it from me oh well another year etc 
 will you be attending the wikimedia conference 
 check out 
 hc do you mean wikimania 
 i corrected the list of metropolitan areas to be accurate the current list is a mix of some msa populations and some csa populations which makes it inaccurate using the csa gave for example raleigh a much higher standing than if the msa population had been used i was going for consistency and i think mine made more sense 
 you removed the given source replacing it with a page that didnt support your edit please try to make a constructive change 
 i mistakenly messed up the source but in the process of attempting to fix it you reverted my changes i am going to change it back with an accurate source listed 
 sure if you give a source we can decide how it fits 
 sorry i have got the correct link and information but have forgotten how to get the title in the reference list to show accurately you can revert it again if you want i have got to run and cant work on fixing the title right now sorry 
 hi tony are you still living in portland theres a meeting in town next week that you might be interested in oh yes it also involves free food and drink 
 a group of us are getting together to participate in the party is at ray kings house whom i met at recent changes camp earlier this year its to encourage bloggers wikipeople and assorted geeks to talk to each other heres the i can give you a lift if youd like 
 as long as your friend is part of the target audience i dont see why not 
 i appreciate the note thank you i should mention that this incident certainly began 
 thats what i get for trying for brevity eh sorry yes i began with good faith but his actions caused me to lose it hence his it out the window 
 im looking for a reliable source do consider finding appropriate sources 
 hi i actually already completed that survey yesterday when you sent me an email nevertheless i look forward to seeing the results of your research regards 
 problem is that the translation from old serbian to modern serbian is in progress the whole document is about N pages the translator is the only one professor the enthusiast he has finished the volume one after N years of work he published it recently and announced the volume two soon than his assistants will translate it in english and put it somewhere on the internet why nobody did it in the past because serbia was under turkish domination from N to N than two world wars than N years of communism than N civil wars on the territory of former yugoslavia sorry we were just a little bussy please pardon my hard language in the previous message try to understand me we the serbs are rising from the dead we try to tell the world that we are alive we had very noble and glorious past and we still some documents monuments and giants such as novak djokoviuN and jelena jankoviuN yes i am a big fan of tennis anyway lets go back to the subject direct citation from st savas nomocanon in english would be the best proof for my statement since i cannot provide it i will remove my sentence about comparison with magna carta are we cool now by the way if its not a secret where are you from greetings 
 okay my point is that specific claims of notability have to be sourced to distinguish them from purely promotional edits 
 thanks 
 mediation is documented at 
 tony hasnt indicated either way the user page tsmed is just a draft it isnt official until we file it at requests for mediation i hope he will but i dont know i dont think it hurts to try it and see if he will 
 is this fine for the wikipedia standards 
 that looks fine 
 i will try to improve them 
 thanks 
 hi noticing you reverted some edit of this article id like to ask you what do you think about that ip keeps adding that link to this article in spite of the fact that it contains few information i have already removed it three times and gave that ip two spam warnings regards 
 id remove it per 
 your comment on tony sidaways talk page about not wanting to lose a battle of wills is exactly on point the guy is utterly convinced hes right and he will trample anyone in his missionary zeal now do you understand why im so adamant about the userbox war ending in a true compromise as things stand especially if tN applies in user space tony will have won his battle of wills and thats the same as giving in to a bully which is exactly what i refuse to do fwiw im considering adopting an obnoxious signature just to piss tony off 
 however since he appears to have the support of those whose opinions really matter and its apparent mine doesnt thats not going to happen apparently the project thinks hes more valuable than those he will run off thats truly sad 
 okkay suppose i decide not to let tony set the rules i load a set of userboxes on a subpage as proposed by the german userbox solution tony comes along and deletes them now what the simple fact is that he has lots of power on this site and nobody appears to be willing to rein him in i have next to no power on this site that means that he does get to set the rules at least until someone with even more power tells him not to hes not listening to you why should he care the slightest what i think 
 you may well be right if your view is proven by future actions i will apologize humbly 
 either a blunder or an instance of wikipedia presenting incorrect information in the diff at the moment i only recall that i compared and saw a chunk that was overlooked and did the revert based on that the diff today doesnt show any chunk that i should have reverted on 
 hi can you explain edit please i thought citation request applies to existence of confusing and this fact is confirmed there in a first sentence maybe it will be best just to take off citation request 
 the edit added a pointer to someone who was asserting that theres confusion as a preamble to providing a meaning which was not in use before that point to make it nonpov it might be better to remove the sentence entirely 
 provide a reliable source looks like thats a missing element from all of your edits 
 dear gtbacchus thank you for contacting me the definition i use as to what userboxes are acceptable in userspace is based on the arbcom ruling on the subject at 
 im making this request that you restore those templates and take them to mfd out of deep concern for the wellbeing of this project we have a chance to not start userbox war iii please lets take that opportunity to do what jimbo actually suggested instead of what hes continued to recommend against i warmly encourage you to trust me on this and to put your good faith behind a different approach to dealing with the userbox problem i look forward to your reply 
 faith in the german solution as i have outlined i dont think that permitting oppositionrelated userboxes is the manner of solving this conflict but i will follow your request and will permit the german solution project to run its course without interference from my administrative actions in the future in the spirit of goodfaith attempts to end conflict and i hope you will accept my apologies should my actions to date have been eviscerating the good work you have been attempting to achieve through the project i regret perhaps my principles of neutrality as regards statements of pov by user have extended too far as i consider that we should really be working in a completely npov environment and i appreciate you may well have a better grasp of the situation than i i hope you have the best of success with the german solution despite my doubts as to its ability to mitigate the controversy and thank you very much for taking the time to talk to me about this best regards 
 ps by the way i have written a brief essay on my idea for more neutral wording of pov userboxes at 
 i have been working on 
 thanks i did notice will read closer and comment as needed 
 hi i noticed that you reverted some updates from N by saying not a novel although i agree that this guy went a little over the top on 
 actually it appears much the same sort of edit focused on things that look more like extracts from a historical novel than a history text it would be nice if you can improve it 
 hello your comment above mirrors quite closely what i have been feeling recently and while it mightnt turn me into a hard core deletionist i can appreciate where they are coming from i do worry about the compromise and whether it will turn out to be a true compromise or stepping stone to eventual removal of userboxes or will it end up being give an einch take a mile i have a sinking feeling that it will be the latter from the initial reactions that now that userboxes are in userspace that they are immune as i commmented in the drv earlier sometimes a compromise is not a good solution for example when one side is what wikipeida ia and the other is what wikipedia is not im also not sure that fds are working as if according to policy something should be deleted but it has lots of popular support then one of two things seem to happen either the result is keep by the numbers or the result is delete by policy and its taken to drv where its overturned by the numbers and round and round we go so right now the deletion process is broken as it ends up keeping material that is popular but against policy so i can fully understand those that think this is going to argued on fd probably argued on drv as well and might end up being kept on pure numbers not policy as well as causing huge amounts of grief in the process so so why not just speedy it for a similar amount of grief but to save that waste of time and be sure it will end up deleted although while i can understand it i think its a risky strategy but the only long term solution is to make people very aware of policy so fd is argued on policy not personal preference but i dont see that happening in this case do you regards 
 a risky strategy i guess that depends what you mean by risky some people think its pretty safe im not on the verge of going rouge yet though there are still good conversations happening and some of us have to keep up the dialogue side of the equation if only for the sake of damage control 
 the problem is how do you resolve the conflict between consensus and principle or how policy normally gets set and how it has been set in this case it is derived from fundamental principles around what the wp project is and from statements the founder and chief policymaker has made rather than based on what popular sentiment at the moment is i am starting to get increasing sympathy for those that delete outside process i must say gt your you know what touches on this 
 one cant continue to not talk about the 
 i have closed against the numbers as you say several times i think that all but one of them stuck without too much drama as to the three examples of failures above i note they are in chronological order and that i think we have handled it a bit better every time partly through process but partly through experianced admins and editors knowing how to handle it in every one of those cases my opinion is that an effective request for comment system could have handled it possibly with a deletion discussion at the end as to noise getting things kept the way for that was paved with schools where are they now 
 summer vacation 
 if you do not want this userright you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time 
 hmm thanks 
 there was a spate of edits linking to that topic a while back consensus was that they werent keeping since the intent was purely promotional 
 there are lots of promotional pages on wikipedia this one doesnt have a lot to recommend it since its little more than a list doesnt delve into criteria comparable awards or anything else not much more than a list 
 what drives links to pages like that of course is reasonably apparent but without a suitable section in the topic that explains how the distinction was earned its not very useful to the casual reader you will find very few topics that provide that type of coverage 
 that would be an improvement 
 im a bit new to wikipedia editing but i did read the external link guidelines and was wondering why you removed some of mine im adding the links to the ccel because i work here and have been assigned to add links to wiki pages so that more people will know about and use the ccel its a great and credible resource please let me know what rules i have broken thanks 
 your talk page contains several comments addressing these issues 
 could you please stop undoing them thank you 
 they are not they are injecting opinion into a factual topic providing advice which is neither pertinent nor accurate looks like simple vandalism 
 yes they are many for example php developers could use the knowledge that this is messing up their scripts please stop preventing people from knowing the truth 
 hi wikipedia isnt a blog nor a forum its for presenting reliably sourced information you have not started 
 sometimes they come back this time from marked for speedy deletion of course can we get this blocked against recreation 
 i guess i can add one to the list of 
 its here have you heard it d 
 haha yeah listened to it not ten minutes ago p its pretty damn good uN 
 hi gtbacchus i have been thinking that 
 cool i figured as much i also assume that if we can agree to something it might have a shot at moving things forward a little bit i will let you know when theres something to rip apart 
 here is a draft 
 ps im not convinced great scott 
 hi could you please stop deleting the pop culture reference i listed for the grapes of wrath the boy meets world episode me and mrs joad specifically is about that book cory and shawn do a strike inspired by the book without realizing the price one must pay to do what you think is right this reflects the books overall plot and moral perfectly and theres no good reason why it should not be included if the source i did cite was not acceptable then what would be one
 to be an acceptable source the reader should be able to find all of the information that you have added without your having extended or interpreted the source 
 thanks for correcting the problem on the 
 the boldface was odd i wouldnt have expected a selflink to do that 
 thank you for your attempt to get through to pschemp but i dont think theres much chance of success not only did she show no remorse over deleting criticisms instead of replying to them but she falsely accused me of personal attacks which is in very bad form moreover her buddy lar wrote some nasty things on my talk page and romarins including threats of blocks im just going to politely write off both of them as bad admins its a big list already but theres always room for more 
 alienus thats a rather interesting definition of nasty i must say i stand behind those remarks and dont really think a reasonable person would see them as nasty i suspect you are not going to get much further along this line before you are politely written off as a bad user so you may want to choose a different road 
 i made some additional changes to the securecrt article including following your suggestion on the talk page could you please review the updated article and remove the tag you added if satisfied thanks 
 yes i saw that and will followup this morning 
 followed up on this some more last week mind taking another peek
 seems id forgotten to log in 
 is this as good a place as any to link to my latest meditation 
 thank you that was interesting particularly the part on ipprofiling im not sure if i agree entirely but it gave me food for thought 
 thats actually a bit that i didnt write but i think it makes sense 
 hi ixbN d like to know why are you constantly removing all information i put in your scm comparison about plastic scm donxbN t we have the right to show there our information as the rest of users 
 comparison or list topics arent the place to start advertising your product which appears to be lacking notability 
 why should we be advertising our product if we just fill the available fields with the same information about our product that the rest of the products in the page this is called comparison not advertising and a comparison to be real must have all the existing products to compare so whatxbN s the problem 
 the other products have topics associated with them which help to establish their notability eg by providing useful thirdparty sources discussing the product which you havent provided in any of your edits 
 dont threaten me i will discuss this as i believe the articles should stand thank you 
 thank you for discussing the matter if you do manage to establish a consensus to keep the articles i will abide by that 
 my note in the edit was intended to make it clear link provided disputes its justness but recognizes the iraq war as part of the war on terrorism and critocizes it likewise it was therefore innappropriate to place there as it contains critocisms of the war on terror after this i received my final warning for disrupting wikipedia to make a point and now i see the attempt to block me was made i hope that this was only a misunderstanding because i honestly do not see what i did that would warrant a block or even a final warning 
 rangeley are you ok with the word being there without the link 
 the last i looked all of the other items in the table have wikipedia topics and have established 
 not really i would actually prefer the entire thing to be removed for the time being because i do not beleive the discussion to be at a point that we can consider a conclusion reached but with hipocrite bringing the discussion itself up for deletion and infact wiping out a large portion at one time unilaterally i dont know if the discussion can last i posted an incredibly lengthy response to why we must not compromise truth simply because some dont beleive it which you may have seen 
 im very encouraged that you are willing to take a long view of the situation in preference to edit warring im working on a reply to your post at 
 hello it looks like you put a removesection template on 
 i put a template on 
 hello tedickey i reverted your edit to 
 the linux console is part of the kernel sources and is (aside from 
 no the term console terminal is generally known to refer to the terminal which is associated with the actual computer rather than something which is separate the term may be confusing to people who are unaware of the origin of the term see for example 
 environment is irrelevant lack of sources establishing notability is the point a quick check with google showed me that its unlikely that you are going to be able to achieve your goal of establishing notability 
 well you want notability of mt newswatcher how about these two links shows N downloads and shows N downloads considering how little the usenet is used and the relative scarcity of mac vs windows systems id be willing to bet that its almost N per cent of mac usenet users that use mt newswatcher 
 hi i was very suprised in the way the administrator 
 without regard to this user in particular there is an excellent 
 i dont know what to do about it but those are most certainly not the issues attempting to be addressed 
 its not really important i think he is trying his best but the whole thing was misconceived and is not going to change the facts the white house describes the invasion of iraq as part of the socalled war on terror and this statement can and should be included as a fact in relevant articles a vote wont change that 
 the straw poll has no bearing on the issue other than to gauge oppinions of the conclusion proposed the issue at hand is not the mere fact that the iraq war was stated as part of the war on terrorism but that it infact is part of the 
 mmmm 
 indeed 
 can you help me and take a short look at tkwww article either i or 
 ok i will take a look 
 would you look over the tkwww article again and evaluate if the article based still on primary source if not would you remove the tag 
 i like having someone who can interpret stuff like the signature squabble for me keeps the discussion from going entirely off the rails 
 thanks tony im glad when im able to help out 
 i think we got off on the wrong foot i respect you i want to get along does that work for you 
 i suppose will see 
 sources are one thing your comments which go beyond the sources are the reason for removing it 
 you might start by reading 
 well since you have already read it you are aware of the points in which it applies to your edits 
 i took the whole edit and its context into consideration and noted that the point of the source was to demonstrate that gmus program was ranked in the top N and that there were additional sources that might have been given 
 i see do you attend gmu seems a more apt explanation particularly since you are making an accusation of bias 
 i disagree accusing someone of bias is a personal attack regarding your personal experience as usual a reliable source is needed to accept your statements as a fact 
 i thought this proposed solution might interest you and im interested to know what you think about it 
 i have just replied at the discussion thanks for the headsup 
 hi ben might you look into 
 on 
 thanks ben actually the quotes were just the latest bit other previous edits by him left the infobox broken and strange and dubious information was introduced best 
 okay i went in and dropped them a quick note encouraging them to give 
 thanks very much ben 
 hey i know its been a while again but heres some more userboxes you can delete
 thanks those went really fast not many links heres batch four 
 those were fast for me as well heres batch five 
 and heres batch six 
 for taking care of that spamlinkage i came across it earlier today as well the difficulty in figuring out the ownership of the referring website was an issue for me 
 i noticed it yesterday and it was something to watch definitely spam 
 google shows only about a dozen hits on the site looks like a series of promotional edits discuss on your talk page if there are useful facts 
 theres no wikipedia topic see 
 i believe you are mistaken there is indeed an article since N and i had it linked besides thats not the reason you originally cited 
 sure its an advertisement theres so far no encyclopedic content in your edits 
 for additional reading add in 
 im still confused what exactly do you see as an advertisement the 
 please elaborate why you think my edits arent encyclopedic i simply provided the same information provided for other products 
 you didnt the other products all have wikipedia topics where someones taken the trouble to establish notability notability is unrelated to advertising a product 
 okay i have edited the 
 better actually i mistook the entry in the comparisonof topic for one of the ones without a topic to avoid that i took out the unnecessary external link from the column which is used in other cases solely to point to the relevant wikipedia topic 
 thats the north springfield page not the political page for xyz official 
 well perhaps not ugh but a mixture of almost laughing and being quite dissapointed in things it appears that the consensus here 
 and just as one would expect people are capitalizing on the no consensus decision 
 dont worry about how long it takes you im not moving all that fast myself anyway heres batch seven 
 and heres batch eight 
 my edit summary was accurate and noting that you have an apparent conflict of interest would be suitable to read 
 one link would be considered versus 
 hi gtbacchus i saw the conversation on alienuss page and just wanted to let you know that was moved to on N may see discussion 
 this caught my attention when a seeming spa an external link to this as the very first external link on the 
 i reverted at least one of those edits spas with a lesswellknown product are likely using the edits for advertising so id revert any that dont point to an established topic 
 aha they spammed the link to the c shell article on the N th i caught and reverted it and then browsed the history for the ch article on the N th then got distracted on other stuff before getting around to asking your opinion in the meantime you spotted it too and tagged it on the N th i missed that heres the essence of problem of reverting those spa edits if you do theres nothing left 
 i usually take a look at the editors history wasnt much to do on the N th except keep an eye for further activity 
 i appreciate your comments on reflection i decided the simplest thing was simply to hat it for 
 good call on your edit today 
 i like the stubs you are making (like 
 thanks man im glad you appreciate them 
 caught your comments on 
 just for the record i dont consider him a troll either however i wouldnt blame anyone for interpreting some of his edit summaries or talkpage edits that way 
 it turns out that im more of a hobgoblin than a troll just thought youd like to know 
 see we have got room for hobgoblins at wikipedia it turns out some hobgoblins anyway despite the superficial resemblance to trolls are quite good to have on board 
 this is more like it passiveagressive and whatnot 
 i want to point out that hobgoblins are much smarter than regular goblins and also smell better than trolls 
 thats pov 
 i have numerous citations to support these claims 
 your comments are uncivil bordering on libel suggest you amend your comments 
 i notice you occasionally use that remark in your edit summaries i understand simple stuff like r and c what does awai stand for 
 its jargon 
 uhm okay but what does it mean where does the term come from i have never encountered it before 
 in the context of wikipedia its the equivalent of counting to ten 
 and heres batch eight 
 finally finished that bunch heres the next batch 
 could you zap 
 heres batch ten 
 and number eleven 
 why are you removing interwiki links from lots of article with no explanation please stop uN 
 i will undo them but from here they arent going anywhere 
 i have not checked all but for example the one at 
 sorry am reverting 
 or best wishes from 
 i will add in my best wishes and 
 if you could come on irc for five minutes at some point to talk to the researcher id really appreciate it 
 not yet shes hopefully calling on monday 
 irc 
 we talked on monday they are hopefully coming to the uk next week and we will arrange something then 
 hmmm trying to think of a simpsons quote to get you to come to irc but cantlol 
 would you mind weighing in on this topic 
 done 
 i apologise again for bothering you bacchus and hope i havent been too out of line 
 i appreciate your invocation for freedom and against censorship and i applaud your dedicaion to these ideals i would point out though that freedom doesnt mean an encyclopedia is a web directory and applying a guideline thats entirely consistent with our mission to be an encyclopedia doesnt amount to censorship just to editorial standards 
 greetings your message was received however i am here to assure you that i have nothing to do with 
 theres an edit from N with that ip perhaps it was reassigned in the intervening two years 
 i have talked to 
 i dont think of it as humoring anyway for nescio theres a very specific argument that hes choosing to not respond to the proper noun misnomer argument by analogy to the 
 thanks and please alert me if you see this sort of ip range messing about there again id like to catch them myself as well
 certainly 
 i noticed that you have reverted that attempt by an ipidentified editor to add an external link a couple times i agree its not that great a link so im not questioning the reverts but i think you may have been a little harsh in labeling it vandalism in your edit summary i looked at the site and it appears to be genuine and intended to offer a helpful summary of vi unless theres something i missed id be inclined to assume good faith thoughts 
 some people have different opinions but mine is that all of the variants addressed in 
 i agree with all that but even if it is his own page he could be a newbie who doesnt yet understand wp policies re notability and selfpromotion and so on he could be wellmeaning but ignorant 
 according to his page its unlikely that hes merely ignorant theres been no attempt to discuss the edit there are a lot of these 
 by now you have probably noticed i requested pp to stop him 
 yes i was thinking along those lines 
 ouch i just realized how dumb i can be i only just now realized that i had only looked at the last few reverts not the N or N before that by you and mindmatrix and others earlier today oh my this was one determined individual 
 yes usually an ipeditor like that sticks to one address and will generally make change comments no feedback so far 
 an admin decided to 
 i see 
 for being levelheaded i have a problem in dealing with people who are willing to act unilaterally like this especially when they have no real desire to communicate as you being the most levelheaded my question is this though if they cant properly explain why we get to ignore policy in this and other cases what do we do with the article whether or not the topic is notable i cant justify its keep unsourced and it doesnt appear if they are about to let me ensure that only properly sourced material remains 
 and as i expected he stopped responding to my questions as i still dont believe thats a valid reason and unilaterally closed the afd N days early 
 i have unprotected your talk page lets talk there 
 what is there to talk about either you will unblock my account as per my request or you will not i was the one that requested it be blocked now i want to use my account again 
 what is there to talk about i dunno how about whether or not you agree to refrain from doing what got you blocked before 
 hey haunted hows it going i noticed you changed coheed to hard rock the profiles coheed own such as purevolume and myspace both say progressive or alternative so should it not stay as progressive see and i think if they say they are progressive we should call them progressive p hope you agree uN 
 oops it appears that i reverted someones edit back to hard rock rather than from it my mistake i do apologize for the confusion i thought i was reverting the edit back to progressive rock instead of hard rock but i guess i wasnt really concentrating lol apologies again mate uN 
 but how userdefax is obviously not an admin why is he writing the blocked template to userpages if he cant block them and why are the users being blocked when they have no edit history am new at this and would like to learn sorry about the improper block will now unblock him if he hasnt been already 
 defax is probably just tagging blocked users that admins forgot to tag i see nothing wrong with that 
 no of course not right of course sorry totally my mistake i unblocked him at once and apologized and hope hes not too put out sorry im quite new at this aspect of administering i totally jumped the gun what happened was with a gale warning out for sockpuppets i saw an editor with redlinked user and talk pages slapping blocked templates i thought it was a perhaps a ploy to slip in an account with blocked templates but that were not actually blocked for later use and some of the accounts didnt have inappropriate names i assume an editor with a redlinked talk page is very new and didnt think that a new editor would be starting his contributions in that way if i had been correct it could have been a mess to sort out so i acted without properly checking the block logs at which i am still pretty hamfisted bad administering lesson learned again sorry 
 no problem im a relatively new admin myself and am in the process of listing some pages i protected a while ago at 
 if this person or publication meet 
 the ch interpreter article has been listed for 
 as usual we are looking 
 heres batch number eleven 
 again no need to worry about getting these done urgently but heres batch twelve 
 i notice you reverted my last edit to 
 sure i looked at the page found nothing special about it and realized that 
 also the licensing on the page detracted from the site keep in mind that there are better sources 
 when you say that 
 near the beginning which links to 
 i know this may be problematic to some particularly given the incoonsistency of some of the manuals et al but to remove the information as you have obviates the template and cannot possibly provide visitors with an informative perspective about this and that in the star trek universe thoughts thanks 
 inferences are from canon or semicanon sources for example the aft torpedo launcher on the saucer module we dont see it in any episode but is in the sttng manual ditto for the captains yacht specs for the defiant are in the dsN tech manual my point as long as information is sourced there shouldnt be a problem in verifying it please take the time to do this before your deletions 
 yes sources should be elaborated upon see 
 actually you are mistaken you removed almost all the information without discussion have you even attempted to verify any of this information where is the discussion regarding this nada if you cannot take the effort to validate information and discuss it before deleting it just as i did when restoring the information dont do so otherwise this will proceed to higher channels 
 lastly im willing to work with any user to round out and enhance articles and source them not to emaciate them as you have if you cannot contribute positively and enhance the information which many trekkie wikipedians have contributed and have a stake in then i will gladly escalate this i doubt you will overcome that 
 i get it fine thank you 
 great thanks for your cooperation if anything our engagements have been a reminder of the importance of continuously improving these articles that can only be a good thing 
 please read and consider changing your mind about whether or not i was fishing for an ip confirmation 
 so you are saying you hadnt caught any yet i mean the comment you linked to could quite easily could quite easily be taken as a last ditch attempt to get a confirmation that its his address how is that not fishing how is talking about which ip addresses might or might not go with which contributors not fishing i honestly dont understand how you are thinking of this 
 its not fishing because there was evidence being considered that both mongo and this ip address engaged in innappropriate behavior thats what the whole evidence page was about in fact but forget it my good faith use of wikispace to organize evidence rather than rushing into an rfc and creating potentially unnecessary wikidrama is only giving me grief believe whatever you wish at this point respectfully i must agree to disagree with you and your consideration of the circumstances in general and i wont bother you anymore about it i hope i have not accidentally conveyed any animosity i have just been so frustrated over this automatic rejection of an unorthodox goodfaith rfc consideration 
 no worries i hope i havent conveyed animosity either wikipedia can be very frustrating sometimes 
 why are you issuing repeated warnings to 
 those were in a topic which was deleted deleted edits dont show up in the editors history 
 oh right i see them now i was worried the warnings were for deleting their own talk page but clearly that is not the case sorry to trouble you 
 no problem 
 i notice that you put ncurses into the category of software programmed in ada if i understand it right ncurses is almost entirely written in c and the only part that is written in ada is the binding portion so imho characterizing ncurses as an ada program doesnt look right but it could be reasonably considered as an ada library thoughts thanks 
 yes i happened to notice the category recently but the ada binding is a substantial fraction of the ncurses source between that and the examples which are written in ada i thought that the category was applicable 
 i was wondering about this myself when i saw that change go by i just didnt know the package well enough to want to show my ignorance by asking i can understand your rationale but i personally would interpret the category definition more narrowly based on what the core functionality of the package was written in not what language bindings might be available as wrappers 
 yes but the name of the category seemed to fit it wasnt something like ada programs or ada libraries not counting the documentation thats about N k lines of source code on the other hand the c++ binding is a minor part of the sources 
 actually the category is free software programmed in ada which probably wont have many topics linked 
 looking at 
 im a bit surprised by the amount of discussion here anyway it seems from the foregoing discussion that the definition of software written in ada is somewhat illdefined i guess in the future more examples will appear and then we can refactor the category i will let tedickey decide since hes apparently the maintainer of ncurses although i personally am inclined to agree with msnicki regarding the scope of that category i agree though that more ada examples should be included in the category 
 hi tedickey you participated in 
 thanks 
 hello tedickey there has been a 
 i see i did read through the site dont agree with jensens blanket approval however hes prone to that type of thing 
 there are two problems with your edit ordering and promotional 
 ulysses isnt an entire retelling but a kind of paraphrase where the mapping between the parts of the story is at times arguable and which as you note is rather obscure 
 so i hope i have managed to get that idea across with something resembling clarity please let me know whether i succeeded in making any sense 
 the greater problem to wikipedia and the one which i feel is clearly giving people the wrong impression is the perception of admins having aboslute power and complete immunity how many times will tony continue to act in such a beligerant manner and be reprimanded for his actions yet not have those actions automatically reversed and his priviledges taken away how many people need to leave wikipedia in disgust at how admins are acting before wikipedia is left destitute people people see it as an admins personal playground for that matter which causes more damage a user box on a user page where someone has to actively find it and then pick a specific user box out of a sea of thousands or a disgruntled user who has been burnt by admins who leaves the website emotional and tells anyone who will listen about how bad wikipedia is i think in the grander scope of things userboxes are far more benign than the current issue of admins and the way in which they choose to work that they are supported by fellow admins and purposely subvert the rules in order to get their own pov across the fact they use divisive and inflammatory as the reason for their speedy delete clearly shows tehir own pov yet they claim they are neutral wouldnt a user box in their own page stating i hate user boxes and will speedy delete it whenever i can get away with it be appropriate in such a case 
 thats mentioned in 
 as my change comment said the source wasnt 
 thats an improvement 
 do you know what the problem is im running 
 is mozillabrowser installed you may be running a version of the gre that is incompatible with your build of gecko# too the apis are in flux constantly so you may just have to wait to get it working 
 you introduced a claim related to rcs that is completely unproven and in addition was published by the author of rcs please do not start edit wars but rather follow the wp rules and use the article discussions where we did already pointed out that rcs is not faster than sccs 
 i already pointed out that your benchmark was deliberately chosen to be biased and misleading furthermore it doesnt address the statement that you find void finally of course your recent edits have the appearance of selfpromotion usually lacking a reliable source 
 your claim lacks a reliable source your claim is based on a missinterpreted toybenchmark from N with N deltas really impressive 
 thats a further claim than you made on the talk page and probably needs a reliable source in place of your selfpromotional edits 
 hello you appear to be involved in an 
 i made one revert today after several days i have made several edits on the talk page but have not gotten a credible response 
 let me just add that 
 i have noticed 
 be careful ip N most likely belongs to user chire who has a long history of edit wars and who tries to stay anonymous since a while when being involved in edit wars you mr dickey are of course also know for a repeated insisting in claims that have been proven incorrect it also looks strange that you try to move a discussion to user pages the discussion belongs to the discussion page of the related article wouldnt it be more apropriate to have a fact based discussion where it belongs you have the chance to give us facts if you have facts please give facts 
 your comments are uncivil not the first warning have you anything to contribute to the conversation than attacking other people 
 please be more careful when tagging article for speedy deletion that you do not overuse csd criteria gN you recently tagged 
 as i was using 
 blatant lie really isnt a csd criteria because what may be blatant to you isnt necessarily obvious to anyone else in this case you could have used aN or possibly aN if the article was a hoax and neither aN nor aN applied afd is a better idea because some hoaxes are notable as hoaxes and some things that seems incredibly implausible are actually true 
 no context i usually saw as a lack of actual information but i suppose thatd be no content as this was just some joke it appeared someone had made up i htink afd would be a bit much but thanks i will keep what you have said in mind uN 
 your arrogance will only get you banned im afraid changing their genre so ignorantly without prior discussion as metallum is not the governing factor on metal in the world will count as vandalism what makes you so sure of yourself i dont know uN 
 well if you look on the cradle page that is how the layout is now extreme metal is the closest genre we can get to without going into pov and we now have something along the lines of 
 fyi i moved the text about the pdpN price from the dec article to the 
 my error for some reason i was thinking of pdpN and misread N as N 
 no problem i changed it back 
 i noticed 
 neither edit was referring to a wikpedia topic the first made an external link to sourceforge the second added the content back without the external link the usual practice is to (see 
 hi gtbacchus im trying to find someone who can explain why the article on encyclopedia dramatica was deleted if you are willing to discuss it with me could you explain how an article on ed wouldnt be able to not violate 
 you commented on a conversation i was having with 
 sorry for taking so long to respond i havent had much time to use the computer except for school work 
 my reasons are perfectly valid and your unilateral changes not necessarily consistent with any standards or wp policy are justified again your changes have not been discussed or agreed upon at least mine have feel free to propose and discuss an alternate system on the wikiproject page first 
 no thats but one type of referencing more to the point 
 as well you imply uN through your edits and approach uN that they are the only ones or are superior and should supplant others without proposing presenting or discussing any of them perhaps you should modify your approach not be so condescending and propose wholesale conciliatory changes to the plethora of star trek articles before going ahead and just implementing yours you may get more buyin and collective assistance to implement them 
 not exactly inline 
 believe me im not trying to shut you down and want to work to mutual advantage but to use an adage you will attract a lot more bees with honey than with vinegar 
 of course i noticed that my points are both should be there not one or the other and you should discuss or propose such changes first before doing them otherwise the articles will remain in a perpetual hodgepodge state 
 my point remains though that you took it upon yourself to make edits that are neither here nor there is it your intention to transform every star trek article in the style and format you propose why dont you propose this on the wikiproject page until then 
 yes a style not the only style and for the last time you need to change your approach 
 as well there are some N N articles in wikipedia so this style is used on only N per cent of the articles therein this is hardly precedentsetting 
 well whats good for the goose may not be good for the gander i dont have any uncertainties about the function of that particular section given the wealth of information about characters a summary section listing highlights and milestones aides understanding why dont you or we combine the milestones and aref sections that would kill two birds with one stone 
 of course not however im just as able to edit as you are and you still dont seem to get the point about collaborating 
 in your opinion in my opinion your additions or stylings colluded and muddied the article what am i talking about case in point did you even read or consider my suggestion about consolidating the two sections until you do this discussion cannot proceed further good day 
 to that end i propose we consolidate the references and milestones sections into one at the end actually thereby making it an endnotes section wikilinks should remain throughout the article as currently or similar make sense 
 im not reinventing the wheel in academic writing an endnotes section includes citations and extra text like episode summaries or highlights references is too narrow a description in this regard a reference section generally lists or cites appropriate works solely im not suggesting we dont include it and that policies do not apply to the st articles but we need to do so descriptively and practically there are a plethora of articles or pages that use varying terms for such a section so the st articles are no different in that respect 
 he he no problem thanks for your input 
 reintroducing a dead link on 
 do read the link its interesting and nonpromotional it might give you some insight on editing style 
 i added citations which point to the facts about both features which are quite uncontroversial claims dont add tags just because you want to win an argument 
 on the other hand you might respond to the points rather than dismissing them unique and notable in context are promotional and you are not noting that 
 unique and notable are not inherently promotional terms thats nonsense besides what is there to promote a free open source app that no one makes money from and i dont use its just one of the many little text editors we have articles on and its important to distinguish whats different about them 
 um your response in the change history is 
 by the way if you have something useful to discuss for improving a topic its polite to carry on the discussion in the topics discussion page 
 i went ahead and did the move because i saw it there and checking amazon its easy to see that we are just correcting an erroneous title here and that nobody seems to be opposing it feedback is welcome it seemed to me like a good corner to cut 
 thats fine with me 
 hi i just want to check with you is your history merge from 
 to the best of my knowledge the histories are correctly merged 
 replied or acted at 
 many thanks for your reviews and kind words much appreciated 
 hip hop groups by nationalities dont go directly into their hip hops nationality category they go into the hip hop musicians category of their nationality i noticed you improperly switched it on 
 the reason we do it this way is so that someone can be looking at 
 i have a difficulty and am seeking advise the problem i have is in getting along with a small group of editors whose edits could be characterized as willing to use poor quality secondary sources willing to leave important things uncited with everyone else i seem to get along fine if you are willing to comment i will list out the problem in as much detail as you direct me to 
 sure i will have a look are we talking about a particular article or articles 
 no harm in having a look but you might wish to take a look at 
 theres always more than an opening statement might suggest im not the type to jump to conclusions i see we are talking about scientology so im putting on my asbestos suit now whats the current dispute 
 i want to thank you for your work on the hong kong sections i just think its a good thing 
 thanks i guess that i just edit and create articles in wikipedia whenever i found subject that interests me i havenuN t done much though compare to some hyperactive hong kong wikipedians but anyway thanks for your appreciation it is really cool especially for a message from one of the editors of the 
 thanks for your compliment in turn i would like to talk to you about a few things especially concerning your post below could you drop me an email at zach at ostensible dot org 
 on N sept N after fred had retitled and made edits to the article and to the talk page appropriately 
 terryeo thanks for the outline and links im looking into it and i will post an opinion presently 
 i would say that if you violated 
 thank you what you said makes sense to me and i appreciate it also you said it in a manner which i can apply widely nice of you to have made a comment to feldspar as well have a good one 
 now terryeo could easily have asked the same question without that judgmental poorly titled there was absolutely no need in the middle of what was supposedly a question to insert a slap at the titling of the guideline an issue that was already being discussed it was completely gratuitous and yet terryeo chose to do it anyways nothing productive was accomplished by his decision to insert that slap at mangoe and yet terryeo chose to do it anyways yet when i remind terryeo that such behavior also falls under 
 again im not certain what point you were driving at in your above post so if i missed it please let me know 
 why dont you ask me i have tried to establish communication with you a number of times not to mention that almost all of the above does not comment about what you said to me but comments about what i said to someone else as if you said something to me because i said something to someone else which you felt moved to step into the middle of 
 do you think that is a right of yours terryeo to which you will always be entitled no matter how badly you abuse it do you think that no one can discuss your behavior without addressing you and seeking your input if so it simply illustrates once again your double standards it certainly wasnt you who alerted me that you were discussing me here on this page you might as well have been trying to keep me out of the conversation entirely but here you are complaining that i am daring to talk to gt as if somehow it was a horrible offense to you that i be allowed to do so 
 antaeus i dont see anything in terryeos comment above that says you arent allowed to comment here i see him asking you why you dont talk directly with him i think its a good question maybe you could read something more negative into his post but i dont see how that would benefit the situation do you terryeo asked me whether he had really been uncivil and for advice which i gave hes been very polite about it maybe you guys have a bad history but i suspect the first step in getting past that is to stop lashing out at one another 
 antaeus hi im expecting company in a minute so i cant give you the thorough reply you deserve right now i will reply in this space as soon as i get a chance 
 thanks please read 
 as a result im going to nominate the original for deletion and should therefore leave a note here smurrayinch
 since you have a better version why dont you simply overwrite my version why bother going through the precedure of voting 
 because i cant overwrite a gif with an svg as far as im aware the software will only let you replace an image with another one of the same file type smurrayinch
 oh i see yeah thats good dispose the old pic and add a better version thanks 
 thanks for the quick block of was getting anoying reverting the same stuff within minutes of the last revert thanks again 
 no problem 
 i thought about a longer or indef block but i normally give shorter blocks when an editor looks to be repeatedly trying to get vandalism past the edit filter as a cool down period if you want to make it indef you can douN after reading his amusing unblock requestuN 
 were any of the words in the unblock request spelled correctly in any case the user is indefblocked as a vandalismonly account 
 since you have been commenting on the subject i was wondering if you had an opinion on whether the 
 i just wanted to make certain i understand what you are saying on the wizard talk page if i go through and disambiguate all N links to that page and find a majority of them dab to the 
 i think so but do ask around to make sure there must be other places you can ask as well 
 sorry i was just asking for clarification on your own opinion since jcN was asking for clarification on consensus he obviously values your opinion on the subject and you are part of the discussion and thus part of consensus im already quite certain the redirect should point to 
 hong kong on the other hand is a different story the prc government can at any time make laws to override the basic law in accordance of the legal principle of parliamentary sovereignty the sinobritish joint declaration cannot prevent that from happening this is another example that prc has effect control over hong kong 
 even without the principle of parliamentary sovereignty the prc still has final say as it has the power to interpret the basic law any way it wants 
 yes but the wording limits the interpretation however with parliamentary sovereignty they can legally do whatever they want with hong kong 
 hi da vynci would you be able to add something about the chinese origin of uN uN to the muchdisputed 
 i dont know if should upload the above theory coz depite it is logical but i seems cant find reference to support it 
 yeah it is also used to mean orangutan in japanese too but the japanese wikipedia page says that the legendary creature comes from china your interpretation makes sense but until we can find some citable source i suppose i should just remove the comes from china phrase thanks 
 it is like saying the term never includes the democratic taiwan the status of the freedom of territory really has nothing to do with the definition of mainland china i would suggest if we can remove it from the definition so it is concise and easier for people to understand 
 manwhy do i see you wherever i go fine as long as it says excluding hong kong and macua i am cool with it 
 you like to visit articles in my watch list i guess lol i will remove the largely selfgoverning bit thank you 
 could you reconsider and my first thought was it was someones joke but you dont seem to be making jokes in other edits do you areally think someone is going to get these confused or if by some stretch they get to the wrong article that they will remain confused or think of it another way i see words in articles that i think should be linked but there is this idea that too many links spoil things so i dont link just everything i think of 
 hi thanks for your message lol of course i dont think all reader who is reading about 
 also the sentence you have been adding about how it is tradition to serve rice in bowls is not necessary for the understanding of the section about using chopsticks to eat rice out of a bowl which is why i have been removing it its a detail that would be better incorporated into a different article and mdash 
 you can either eat in the chinese way or the western way the western way is out of the scoop of chinese etiqutte moveover the almostneverservericeonplate traditional custom deserves to be noted 
 while theres no blanket ban on linking to youtube (see 
 i am interested to know where on wikipedia guideline says youtube videos are not be used as a reference henever possible your claim about the instability of youtube links and copyright issue may not apply to that particular vidoe because is owned by the crown please see details on the articles talk page good day 
 well im not going to apologise because i think you are overreacting however i reiterate that i wish i had made a more appropriate choice of words a useful lesson here is that edit summaries are in fact just as important as the edits themselves i also think there may be a wee element of crossedwires here you seem to be offended by the word naughty which where i come from is almost exclusively used in a lighthearted and completely nonadversarial context and is very unlikely to ever cause offence perhaps this is not the case elsewhere in the world as described above shouting down was a poor and illthought choice of words which did not accurately convey my intended meaning that one was down solely to my own poor use of language i certainly did not mean to cause offence although i confess that from my perspective given that you seemed to have reversed your position within the space of two edits it did seem that you were perhaps being deliberately contrarian for no obvious purpose if editors wish to refer to afd as a vote and especially if they wish to refer to individual contributions as votes i think its perfectly reasonable and frankly pragmatic majority vote and vote are emphatically not the same although if you say that many editors mistakenly transpose these terms then i cede to your greater experience since you dont seem to agree you might at least consider stating your opinion in a more subtle way rather than bluntly stating afd is not a vote just a thought for the future all the best 
 i didnt ask you to apologize i think you were totally within your rights i accept that everyone misspeaks sometimes and i have no problem with you at all ^^ thanks for your thoughts 
 sorry i should have made clear the above was in response to thanks nonetheless for the kindly message 
 i am british although im not english dont worry at all crossed wires happen and debate does get too robust on here at times no harm done whatsoever im quite certain no offence was meant on either side now lets wait and see how the substantive debate ends upa wikipedia without 
 despite it is a japanese manga uN bN b is definitely a chinese surname not a japanese one even says so where the third line reads uN eN duN fduN auN uN buN buN uN cuN buN dN uN euN eN uN uN it even cites uN bN buN fuN aN a as example 
 could you undo the edit but explain why in your edit summary that is for everyone else to know 
 thanks for looking into it 
 im in ur wiki leavin u messages <N 
 im thinkin u dont love me anymore snuggums ur not leavin any love on my talk page im in bed with the laptop and no panties and im oh so lonely heartiez 
 i got ur msg sweet thang i just wanted you to know in that pic the only thing im wearing is that sheet sweet dreams gt <N <N <N 
 hi there im sorry i wasnt trying to say that you were making personal attacks i was trying to say that the argument you were making was not justified based on the same logic as personal attacks i completely disagree with your example regarding new york for the same reason editors from anywhere are of course encouraged to write about new york or hong kong or wherever so long as they are putting in appropriate material now im not saying the editors you have a problem with are putting in appropriate material but your opposition should be phrased against the arguments they are making not against where you believe they come from if they are consistently making edits that are biased counterproductive or simply wrong you may be able to get an admin to take action against them but the argument you cant edit my citys article because you are not from here is clearly not valid on wikipedia 
 i see your points and the issue in that article has been settled by discussion but it is interesting how u repositioned my arguement i remember what i said was similar to those who havent actually been to hong kong should listen to the opinion provided those who actually are living there that is quite different from you cant edit my citys article because you are not from here 
 i have a question are there any concerns with how multiple user accounts and threats 
 apparently not 
 hmmm i like the idea i suspect the article has a lot of content that would be difficult to cite but its definitely worth a try im away from home just now checking in from a friends computer but when i get some more time i will have a closer look 
 thank you for experimenting with {{#ifbritish museum or the page 
 that was not an experiment british museums stolen artifacts are well known in asia please take a look at 
 so you made an edit that states that every single item in the asian collection is a stolen item something that is not true 
 i didnt type the words every single item so please talk to the person who wrote that instead well if that appears to be a problem u can well remove those words and replace it with most items or many items but the words stolen has to stay in the articles 
 what neutral references do you have for them being stolen remember this is wikipedia and all such claims need to be verifiable from proper neutral sources 
 hello theres no need for that other uses tag on the titanic articles because the titles of the articles make it fairly obvious how to get to the page to which you link if someone lands on 
 i wont revert you i think the otheruses tags are just fine but its not worth arguing over 
 i agree that its not worth arguing over so i hope we both leave this discussion happy 
 oh an example of when it is useful 
 you seem to be applying a criterion that makes sense to you so yeah im happy i confess to not understanding why an otheruses link is helpful on 
 oh i was just saying someone else has real problem reading my writing lol i wasnt referring to your username 
 i knew you werent referring to me 
 as im sure this is a fairly thankless task you might want to know that its appreciated thanks and mdash 
 you are welcome thanks for the comment actually i find page moves kind of meditative and pleasant sometimes low profile is a good thing in fact i think i will do a few now 
 it is a form of respectful address just as respectful when colipon said da vynci i respectfully ask you to refrain from making more judgments on me those respectful words helps to keep the conversation civil if colipons exact same words have been used to you and say things like areadin i respectfully ask you to refrain from making making more judgments on me and interpret my writing in a scarastic way how do u think it sounds 
 fine we all make mistakes ha ha ha ha ha glad to give you some chuckles 
 thanks

 its been a while hi again the usual closer of deletion reviews 
 i hope i did that correctly i have never closed a drv before i dont think 
 thanks for closing it looks like standard formatting to me it seems like xoloz closes more than N per cent of deletion reviews so everyone else is out of practice and we sometimes need to solicit alternative closers im just glad the drv volume is low enough that we dont need more than one regular closer that says something about the quality of our afd closes though something good

 take a look at 
 im going to wait til i hear from you til i proceed any more 
 it is my view that the best way to handle this is to move 
 i suggest that further discussion on the merits occur at 
 not much pops hows it going 
 are you down with ten of the trades why dont you comment at my editor review please thanks in advance boyo 
 im down with ten devils up on the downstroke and pretty much over the rest of it but thats all nonsense theres not much to reivew at this point see if you can add some sourced material to some articles thats the best 
 truth is that the number of people on the net who speak the 
 kseferovic the vast majority of montenegrins say they speak serbian 
 i dont understand anything you say could you please elaborate plus what does the serbian population of montenegro surely believes that the language is serbian mean also bear in mind that you are talking to a montenegrin right now 
 i know it sounds crazy and counterintuitive but gfdl and ccbysa are not compatible see also the long discussion at 
 replied on my own talk page p 
 in an unrelated note i have noticed you have used one of my created userboxes 
 well i am actually serious about it i believe hk shouldnt have been given to china or at least not all of it because some parts we didnt have to give back 
 that is true however there is another faint possibility and that is a hk rebellion and declaration of independance from china then request to become a british territory again whichi do accept is equally as unlikly as the possibility that the uk breaks the treaty 
 london was never a us territory given to the uk 
 got a start of it going 
 i took a look and it looks very good and has the emphasis on creating an account like it should be i have a few thoughts i will try to add or comment on later not much editing time at this moment thanks for working this issue 
 why are you looking for references for all the other nicknames except portland fucking oregon 
 good luck 
 is your thesis done or should you extend this break i see a bunch of contribs from you 
 i will probably take another wikibreak when its time to whip the final draft in shape which had better be sometime this month for now im safe to spend a few hours on the wiki 
 with regards to the leaving town issue id say that leaving town tacked another N years on to my phdand while i wish it hadnt i dont regret the move 
 could you explain how my edit on 
 wow just wow i ask you in a way i think is quite unoffensive why you feel the image should not be resized and i get that being of the belief that an image being a little bit smaller for the overall benefit of an article merits the need to take the fucking thing off and such an action is spoiling it for everyone else is quite stunning its quite clear you cant be reasoned with so good day to you 
 why does it always have to get like this i feel me and you betweeen us probably edit most of the conference we both seem to have a love for our respective teams but i just feel you cant let me do things without having the final say and watching over my every edit i upload great pictures of the players which take a lot time and effort to do and i know they would be sadly missed if i didnt put the time and effort in i dont think im being unresonable its not like im spamming the pages or putting uncited details we should work together not against 
 work together we should and the best way to achieve that is through discussing things and concluding what the best option is id like to make it clear that my qualm with the sizing of your images in no way reflects any negative opinion toward them they show the players in question clearly and i dare say without them those articles would have remained without images im sorry you feel that you cant edit without me having the final say although im not sure on how many ocassions we have actually engaged in any significant edit conflicts i feel the best way to resolve this issue is by raising it at the talk page of 
 hi sorry about not looking at more carefully before reverting it although i recall the and the message i left you here i dont recall even making the second one so im not sure how that happened mea culpa in answer to your however yes material needs to be sourced in each article in which it appears there is no centralized parent article to which readers are supposed to go to for references since each article must stand on its own even if its a listtype article thanks 
 the citation of kings assistant on the official forum was not for the N synopsis from marvel spotlight but instead for the statement that the plot details of the novel have changed kings assistant marsha defilippo does post on the official forum of which she is a moderator under the name ms mod its a wellknown fact thought im not sure how to provide a verifiable link for that if you look through ms mods posts of the official forum it will become evident 
 liljas library is indeed a fan site as is indicated in however while writing a book in and of itself does not automatically qualify one as a reliable source the fact that his book is indicated to include over N interviews with king and is published by a nonvanity press publisher may qualify him i have started at the reliable sources noticeboard to get more feedback on this if others indicate that its a reliable source i will restore the material in question in the meantime however you say that most of the material sourced to that site actually comes from kings site if thats the case then why not just cite kings site do you have the urls for that material thanks 
 news items mainly either came from the front page of stephenkingcom the official message board or bev vincent a published author and king scholar whos close to kings office for instance the cited newsitem about the voting process on which book king should write next is no longer available as the poll has been taken down from the front page of kings site the text as far as i can see only remains at liljas library 
 as to you comment on centrxs talkpage no even if the vocal majority would want to make wikipedia to be their free webhost it would not become one since a free webhost is not what wikipedia is but we are not talking about that what we are talking about is to which point wikipedians are allowed to display their own opinions especially with the use of userboxes i agree with you that blatant adverting userboxes vote x or attack userboxes y should be killed have no place here on wikipedia at the same time i believe that showing support something should be permitted also it worries me that the deletions of political userboxes might be only the start take the animeotaku userbox on my page for an example an admin might argue that it is not helping building an encyclopedia and delete it i feel it is both an expression of personality and helping build an encylopedia it tells other users that about this intrest of mine and they know that i might be willing to help out improving anime related articles alas im slowly growing weary of this constant tug of war all i want is peace and a satifying compromise for both side and yet it seems at every corner the compromise we tried to build is attacked if its not an inclusionist hardliner who wants to go back to the old status quo its a deletionist admin that seems to try to inflame that old wound the voice inside me that says its not worth it just delete your userpage and leave has grown stronger lately maybe i should heed its call 
 as for the tugofwar i suspect im on your side despite my personal feelings about pov userboxes i voted to overturn that deletion and would do it again for the sake of ending the pointless drama 
 you know i have always had the greatest of respect for you mate i now also start to agree why it might be better without political boxes if it is the price to keep rabblerousers and blatant political advertiser at bay it might be necessary to pay it and still the sordid actions of few during the userbox wars have left me scarred have destroyed my faith in the administrative community of wikipedia i know in my mind that all admins are actually good guys and gals but the way many of the admins merely looked away and did not intervene in addition to the brashness of a handful have take away faith that should again a handful of administrators decide all userboxes must be gone this time in userpace too that they would meet strong enough oppositon to avoid another userbox war i fear that if we allow the removal of those political ones this would be the wedge other less userbox friendly and more brash administrators might try to use to archive what they believe is best for wikipedia and they would not face strong enough opposition to deter them and thus the wars would be ignited again only even more vicious this time as users would feel attacked at their hometurf in userspace in this tug of war i feel our objective is that neither side lands facedown in the mud 
 i understand the of 
 hi i got some responses on the reliable sources noticeboard i think you should read 
 hi again someone posted a new message in the rsn discussion and mentioned a web reference archiving site called i thought you should know so that you could cite posts from stephen kings official site if you want 
 thanks for going through and deleting the useless redirects in trying to revert the editor who moved the article N times all those pages got created feel free to look through mine and that editors logs to see if anymore redirects need to be deleted semper fi uN 
 i think they are all gone now 
 big thanks semper fi uN 
 have fun er and there was i thinking this was something about innovative homeimprovement in that case good luck 
 about as constructive as threatening wikipedia users id say 
 short of clearing the battlefield theres very little any admin can do in this situation i dont think blocking N or N people is a useful nor a calming measure and wont solve the problem as it will resume the moment they get back there are over N admins on wikipedia and at least two others actively watching neither of whom have any questions of coi and neither of whom have blocked any of the present participants over this matter 
 protective admin are you making further wrong and baseless accusations 
 again if you wish to make accusations please back them up with some evidence rather than insulting me thankyou 
 any chance we can end this insanity i will reveal here i have been chatting privately and separately to each of you and i know that each of you knows the allegations you have obliquely levelled against each other in the above section are false as you are both so convinced you are right im not even going to hope for a retraction but i would remind everybody in the john howard case of the usual 
 the reason why im moving the series tabke into the infobox is because its done that way in the other rivalry articles and ndash 
 i know but with this being such a longstanding rivalry it would look unwieldy in the infobox a separate table is easier to grasp and comprehend at a quick glance it gives a great and clear overview i believe 
 hello gt i appreciate the inquiry i got that graphic directly from the main just about a week ago the graphic is still there now but im not sure if that particular slogan is mentioned anywhere else such as in their stores or tv ads or anything but it is prominently displayed on their home page from when i contacted them via phone they claimed it is a direct replacement of the word christmas so as not to endorse the christian holiday and mdasheven though its a very awkward sentence and mdash 
 replying at 
 what do you think of this idea and mdash 
 thats something i hadnt thought of actually i think its a good idea i will try to implement it as soon as possible hopefully it wont make the table too large also the forgotten tales of love and murder book was added by another user i purposefully left it off because i was unsure about how to present it since i wanted to adhere to order of writing and i dont think thats known for some of those stories 
 if a magazine story was never released as a book you can leave the book title and book date columns blank for that entry however im not sure what to do about a story that never appeared in magazine form but was published solely as a book should the original title and first publication be left blank for such things or should you include them and just make them identical to the book and mdash 
 thanks a bunch 
 no problem 
 looks great d 
 i made the text at the top of the infobox white i would wait to add the actual color to the list of official colors official word so far has been blue silver and white 
 all right thanks 
 i left no nonsense on the reagan page if you could point out the socalled nonsense that would be great the only changes i made was the fact that he was born above a bank not a bakery and the book noonan wrote entitled when character was king the story of ronald reagan none of these constitutes nonsense and your kneereaction was completely unnecessary 
 how is it you are blocked if you can post to my talk page your is empty huh oh well i will have a look at the btnh article 
 thanks ~ 
 note aol uk ips are now owned by carphone warehouse so dont be surprised to see their name when checking for hc sock ips 
 the mo of that anon vandal seems similar to bambifan but that ip resolves to michigan bambi does the majority of his nonsense from alabama however if you even so much as think you smell this guy please let me know his destruction and damage is nearly incaluculable thanks for letting me know and believe me asking about something like this is not a bother 
 you bet it was a pleasure hearing from you you may find 
 hi marnette im really sorry to bother you but i dont know many people here on wp and could do with a bit of help on talk page archiving i moved my talk page to 
 i really appreciate your help with that nice to know there are some good people on wp willing to help out thanks 
 when you have a moment can you take a look at this article 
 thanks for your quick reply off i go 
 done and done 
 to my mind the synopsis is a summary what you might get in the blurb on the back of the dvd the plot has much more detail including stuff you wont want to know before watching it plot often has spoilers synopsis shouldnt have many if at all 
 hi again r thanks for acknowledging my edit summary as i went through the classic series articles i kept finding the two terms used inconsistently some articles have only one or the other of the headers and some have both when i started here N + years ago we had a synopsis in the lead and then the plot section below that that disappeared somewhere along the line i think my next mini project might be to go through and try and make them consistent on another note sometime in the last two or three years someone seems to have started a restructuring of the format of the classic series articles but they ran out of steam somewhere around the end of the N nd drs or start of the N rds era on another another note i am a bit concerned about this we have renewed the series for N episodes we arent going to have any new episodes in N and we might not have any til the N th anniversary in N i wonder if there is something going on internally at the beeb that we dont know anything about yet one more item it is a nice coincidence of the calendar that the N th is on a saturday wonder how they are gonna do that the eleven doctors episode 
 so with my stack of books by dicks or haining or cornell or day or topping or howe or stammers or walker or etc i can try to keep a lid on the classic stories which brings me to my main worry are the activities of readding the stuff that you are removing as unsourced trainspotting etc 
 thanks for your note i will try to respond in order i still like N drs as it was the first time they attempted to bring the shows history together N drs has its problems most due to what has come to be described on the dvd commentaries and making of segments as jnts showmanship over content proclivities but i do remember how exciting it was to see it at the time and to be seeing it before it was aired in the uk remembrance was fun and i liked it better that the official N th anniversary story silver nemesis which suffered from having too many plot beats that were just like remembrance you are right about leap years being the determining factor in day or date matchups the quickest they can happen is N yrs and the longest is N which we are currently in btw i too gave up on editing the new series articles ownership issues are always a problem with them i stopped several years ago after trying to cut back on an absurd amount of repeat info in partners in crime and then i was told that because it was a ga or fa it couldnt be edited it read like a N th grader who has to write a report of N words repeating the same thing paragraph after paragraph i would know because i probably did that all those years ago the promotion to ga or fa status was closed after about N or N editors had commented and the ep hadnt even aired in the us yet you are right about the problematic nature of the trainspotting being added at the moment the editor does seem to be sourcing some of it but the rest is mostly or and synthesis i was thinking of letting it be for small period of time and then going back through it but dont wait on me if you dont want to one last note did you get to see this edit summary during one of my repeat viewings of hands of fear years ago i noticed that the N th dr says in here you cant hurt us and we cant harm you there is no further line stating whether the in here means the entire tardis or just that control room so i thought that my idea was a more elegant answer to the conundrum than the one given to nyssa ah well i have taken up too much of your time so back to editing and have a great weekend 
 i was wondering whether itd be possible to get 
 actually scrap that sorry 
 ok i was just gonna say that if theres any way to mention a particular meme in the N chan article (need a 
 vandal 
 thank you for the notice seems he was hit by an autoblock 
 do you think hes going to stop this behavior because his most recent message to me makes no indication that hes going to 
 it is no bother at all i am not sure that i have any solutions my understanding of nfcc is less that nil my one suggestion is that if future pics come under question that you get other eyes on the situation by going to whatever wikiproject that might be involved with the article in question if it is something simple then the picture can be saved if it cant be saved the best thing might be to move on to the next bit of editing i have had hours and days worth of work that has been deleted for various reasons it is always a total drag on the other hand there is always vandalism to fight and the occasional thing to add to an article that might enhance it have a better week in this upcoming one and cheers 
 thanks for your help with the moves of the korean olympic pages 
 no problem 
 hi re i dont think that your suspected sock is correct the most recent actions of mine that might enrage another user concern my posts at 
 hi again thanks for the update if you have seen the top of my talk page i have a note from a few years ago about hc who was a true pest it is old so im sure that you are right but that is where i start from i am always happy to have a tag that i add changed to the correct info and i see that you have already done so i remember seeing that name in the last few days so i will add it to the memory banks and keep it in mind im sorry that you are under siege by this person cheers 
 hello intelligent life in the universe i recently read the dmoz article and it prompted me to see more about the cool popular new site aboutusorg which is truly open there was no mention of it only the old dmoz is listed and aboutusorg was googled and shown to have N million search results since its opening in august N imagine how upset i was to see it up for speedy deletion i requested help and was told i was self promoting please visit the new beginning article and defent aboutusorg thanks 
 i cleaned up the article a bit and removed the speedy deletion tag after which someone immediately added a proposed deletion tag which is the correct next move in the deletion process proposed deletion takes N days during which time the article could be cleaned up significantly i suggest reviewing our policies of 
 at risk of sounding argumentative have you ever seen this movie and lets forget about that for a moment the majority of directors involved are independent film directors if it doesnt say that in the article well thats not my fault but it is at the very least an independent film and there is no category for independent films here if you want to leave it like that fine im not gonna fight you over it but just consider what i have said 
 i have seen it and own the deluxe dvd set this kind of film has been done before 
 followup both of those terms have the problem of subjectivity also just because a director is independent that does not mean that the films the make are avant garde or experimental 
 i saw your edit summary i didnt categorize it that way because of its vignette format and when i say independent im referring to the style marked by mostly aesthetic sensibilities but that is interesting what you said about 
 thanks for the followup if you want any input on getting a wikiproject going i can recommend posting at 
 thatd be great i was going to do it myself but if you want to help me out what do you mean posting im not up on all that lingo plain english please 
 basically 
 no you didnt have to help i just didnt know what you meant posting but thanks 
 lol 
 wikipedia is both emotionally taxing and addictive its true welcome aboard and please let me know if i can help answer any of your questions 
 in response to your question re why two templates i created templatepowerbookgN tiger first but then discovered that that would not work in a babel box so i created templateuser_powerbookgN tiger if the former can be removed then i will edit it with an afd 
 umm oic if you have a look at the original edit you will note that im drawing your attention to some uncivil behavour on another users talkpage this has little to do with whatever is occuring offline the fact that timeshift wishes to bring it to wikipedia is largely an issue of your creation by providing him with confidential information however this is largly bytheby and i am willing to continue to 
 how about concentrating on your own edits rather than others as well as stop making implicit offwiki threats i know which is worse the question is do you 
 please consider refactoring your uncivil edits also please cease and desist in the accusation of implicit offwiki threats as no such implicit offwiki threats were made unless invented by either yourself or oic given that you are engaging in uncivil behavour it is appropriate that it is pointed out to an admin oic prehaps an or i is a more appropriate forum 
 go for it 
 the comment i was directed to was no better and no worse than i see every day looking around wiki im not sure that any admin would have seen any cause to act on it as for my allegedly inventing things i have made my view known and resent such accusations i never accused shot info of threatening anybody and dont believe that he did anyway i reiterate i think this needs to end somewhere and here is as good a place as any 
 thanks for the clarification over who is inventing the accusation given that i have had no correspondence with timeshift other than directly on wikipedia it is quite clear that his accusation is a fiction of his own creation with regards to the directed comment i concur to your opinion however must note that prehaps an uninvolved admin viewpoint is pertinent as similar comments made outside of the australian political spectrum were noted to be uncivil (cf 
 as i suggested at the other talk page yesterday the problem is always when you raise a concern that you are not causing the same concern yourself in another location a parallel from my own occupation its like when the boy runs into the teacher yelling he hit me and you bring the other boy in to talk to him and he has a black eye the original complainant cant explain coherently translate that here and you see the admins problem 
 i am quite aware of administrators problems which largely stem from a lack of support from arbcom and other admins sometimes when one is an advocate of iar they actually need to 
 yes and my view of the vu situation in particular is well known wp did not handle that situation well at all however those macro dramas have little play here this is trivial stuff that could be resolved except nobody seems to want to there is no critical issues at stake here like the pseudoscience wars its just people who cant get along fighting over anything they can find an excuse to fight over when im asked to fix ones transgressors while ignoring their transgressions im just not going to act on that and youd have to find a very unusual admin who would be willing to ignore the complainants own erratic and at times provocative and inflammatory behaviour when deciding what to do 
 ok will leave it for an or i in the future thanks for your time and for clarifing the information above 
 looks like duja is not online could you help him out see 
 in the case of a normal user such actions might be just being bold but in the hands of an admin they seem to be in clear violation of the content and spirit of basic wp policies and since an admin knows that cutandpaste moves hide the history and prevent normal users from restoring older versions it would seem morse not only violated wp policies but in effect destroyed community efforts which definitely is vandalism 
 i couldnt care less what makes you conclude that morses move was vandalism i will not entertain that conversation even if you are right its not a productive line of argument it is very clear to me that morse believes that this page should be located at 
 in addition hes advocating something that clearly falls under 
 please dont take my annoyance on that talk page personally i know you are doing good work here and that you have to deal with some difficult characters the wiki is full of them the best strategy i have learned is to eschew any kind of accusation of bad intentions no matter how obvious they may seem the trick is to just focus focus focus and resist the urge to call foul when all else fails get more people involved we have got policies and guidelines to fall back on to prevent anyone from getting far without consensus let those policies stop pov pushers and vandals without ever having to call them povpushers or vandals its remarkable effective and you avoid a lot of distracting and inefficient offensetaking escalation namecalling etc 
 thanks once again for excellent advice i guess i got upset because this same page move contrary to the very recent and exceptionally wellsupported consensus decision has already happened at least twice could you please create redirects to block all those other possible synonymous page titles that violate the established consensus actually i could do that too but it seems they get deleted and then reused for this pov pushing there is nothing wrong with spending time discussing even with people that have very strange ideas its when they are able to affect article names and create a need for timeconsuming admin operations like your N steps and rms to move the article back that it gets on my nerves i also of course dont have anything against a new rm that attempts to move it back to a title i disagree with but i do believe we should all conform to an existing rm decision unless a new consensus has been found 
 it was one of the more involved history merges i have dealt with there may have even been a more efficient way to do it anyway i look forward to see what kind of reply we get from mr morse 
 if you are going to pull the discontinuity section you might as well go ahead and pull the response section too 
 not to play dumb but how so they are two different things response sections are often apart of film articles errors or discontinuity sections are rarely part of these articles per wiki policy the information isnt really encyclopedic 
 it seems like a block is in order would you investigate thanks 
 hello spanglej and thanks for your message i let the admin that i have worked with over the last couple of months in this situation know about this new ip just before i logged off last night you can see the thread and their response here 
 i did notice your first selfblock but according to the block logs you did so again gtbacchus plong night huh 
 yeah i got hit with an autoblock now at least i know what kind of screen comes up when you try to edit through a block my record is no longer spotless ( i have gotta be careful clicking on block links in page histories 
 oh come now gtbacchus im sure spotless record or not people are aware of your good intentions even the questionable iwanttoselfblockmyself onesjust kidding anyways wish you a nice wikipedia week 
 however the recent bbc radio N serialisation of anthony darlows life gives anthony maurice as anthony goldschmidt is maurice a pseudonym or should the article be revised regards 
 hello j i found a couple items that might help with you question this link goes to a website that you might already know about playing with google i came up with this this might not be who you are talking about but if it is then the answer to your question might be that he didnt use his last name and since it might be to germanic for a country at war there might have been a good reason not to use it for a period of his life i can recommend that you ask 
 please restore this article i had reviewed it while deleting csds and the nominator used rollback to undo my decline of the speedy i will go to drv if you choose not to restore 
 i apologize that i did not notice that and probably would have suggested prod or afd if i had i was looking for earlier versions to find a nonpromotional version and couldnt find one but didnt notice that the speedy template had gone and reappeared can you suggest a version that is not promotional to restore 
 thanks i dont see any of them really as being the exclusively promotional that qualifies for gN speedy so i cant recommend to you any of them over another 
 hey when you get some free time would you want to help me get smithers up to fa i have no experience on any character articles even to the ga level let me know if youd like to help me with this or if you would rather stick to episodes thanks 
 ok i suppose i can wait 
 in other words the one eyed guy with one arm that came to kill tuco in his bathwater i figured it out that was one of the bounty hunters in the opening scene what threw me is that he really didnt look much the same in that later scene and also to be honest in the opening scene even though that character fired off a shot in the air he fell down unconscious and seemed like he bought it tooand died thats why i was wondering why the article said that only two died instead of all three because it really seemed that that third one got killed also and again he didnt look totally the same in that later scene where he was talking about learning to shoot with his left hand lol do you believe that after all these years of knowing about this movieand seeing it that just now because of your revert did i finally figure that out that guy about to shoot tuco in the bath was that bounty hunter from the opening oh well now i got it thanks 
 you are welcome it also took me several viewings over the years to figure out that it was the same actor i think one of the extras on the deluxe dvd version points this out as well but i cant remember if it is the commentary or in one of the making of documentaries i know exactly what you are talking about when thinking some part of a film is one thing and it turns out to be another i saw the film 
 regarding your recent edit to the rocky marciano page where you removed gene tunney as being an undefeated heavyweight boxing champion along with rm i would argue that point gts only official loss came in a light heavyweight bout (as can be seen if you go to his 
 i have gone back and reworded it to better fit the facts but would still like your thoughts on the wording 
 the rewording is fine and good job i was tracking an ip whose edits were problematic at best and who was just messing with articles by adding unsourced factoids i glad that you fixed anything that i left behind and cheers 
 moved ryuN bkyuN b islands to ryukyu islands per discussions at mosjp see talk page for details that vote has not be concluded yet there are new votes coming in even now the poll is supposed to last two weeks please wait until at least december N th which is when the vote is supposed to come to a conclusion thank you 
 hello you initially reviewed some of the ryuN bkyuN b vs ryukyu poll there is debate over the results of a poll and how to proceed with those conclusions would you please take a look at the 
 thanks for moving 
 ta for the info certainly a strange bunny taking up a lot of other peoples time whatever its about mental health stuff best wishes 
 seems to be making much the same adds catholic cats also but with a different pattern 
 i think it may be time for an spi to be sure given ip N s use of the disney name in the past noted by span above and at 
 ok im absolutely convinced that disneychicago is the ip N editor check out the history at 
 bacchus im sorry but if booyaka is allowed to get away with this there is inconsistency in wikipedia policy 
 i dont understand are you arguing that we should keep unverified material are there no publications in which nonamerican wrestling is discussed 
 im arguing that verification is more difficult outside of the us because there arent many members from other countries with such interests booyaka is paying that no heed at all and to your question the answer is no there isnt and thats part of the problem even with proof he still wants more ridiculous 
 are you saying that nonamerican wrestling should be an exception to 
 it would appear that this would be booyakas reverse argument im not claiming an exception im claiming more flexibility which booyaka has refused to give the pcw australia article is a great example of this 
 so how do you think we should handle the verifiability requirement for nonus wrestling articles do they need to be sourced or not in your opinion 
 how is the pcw article not verifiable for example it is the cutting from the newspaper is more than enough verification surely if its not then i query your interpretation of verifiable sources anyway i have added in the deletion nomination a source that can not be used for the reasons i described but it still exists 
 i didnt say the pcw article isnt a good source i was just trying to figure out what you meant by more flexibility 
 what i meant is that coming up with third party sources in australia is much more difficult because pro wrestling doesnt get anywhere near as much coverage in the electronic media as it does in the us as an example so the demand for verifiability has to be more flexible due to local issues i hope i have cleared that up 
 hi i wonder if you could have a neb at 
 i took a look imo the mention is of dubious notability but when another editor is so insistent you have to decide how far you want to go you might post a thread expressing your concerns at 
 thank you very much for your thoughts i rarely have been involved in long ranging disputes so no this is all useful info i did post it on the blp noticeboard but there have been no replies i have found this editor to be an uncivil grump with everyone it doesnt seem worth pursuing third opinion is a good idea thanks for all your work have a good weekend 
 hi jon i have repeated your request at wpschools on the article tp the article looks very good already probably due to your experience in working on fas i will not do much to it because its the sort of thing i would pick out of the gac list and i would like to remain neutral if i were to review it i will be watching it closely though 
 thanks i will have some other editors look it over and see what else they would suggest before taking it to gan and hopefully more editors will have a look at it 
 i have finished my review you obviously put a lot of work into the article and i appreciate its neutral tone i have placed it on hold 
 i ran the dead link report and it flagged the two refs as problems the third ref should be marked subscription only i agree that the lead paragraphs should summarize the article however fine details like the school colors are not sufficiently important to be included the lead of the abraham lincoln biography can certainly mention that he was killed but should not describe the decor of the room where he was shot see 
 where do we stand do you have any further specific questions for me i will reread the article to assess your changes thanks 
 g sort of i mean does flexible mean we allow a bunch of unsourced information to sit in an article for a week a month indefinitely what does it mean better than writing an article and then talking about being flexible about waiting for sources would be to write articles only after you have found sources because you are writing them from sources and not from personal knowledge if the content in these articles didnt come from reliable sources then where did it come from 
 ps evidence has come up that all but prove that booyakadell is a sockpuppet of jbN take a look at the rfc for him and see what you think 
 you mention information that would otherwise be rightfully placed in an online encyclopedia such as wp why would it rightfully be placed in wp without sources wps mission is to provide sourced information why is it rightful to violate our basic policies 
 btw the issue of sockpuppetry is important because this is clearly a case of ban evasion the issue has become clear on the rfc with booyakas latest edits giving away the fact that he is indeed the banned jbN take a look at the rfc and in particular the talk page 
 ps if you are truly concerned about the ban evasion you should bring it up with maybe the 
 im going to have to address this on my own talk page because i need to dissect this 
 since i see you are doing gans do you have time to review 
 i dont have any in gan at the moment im looking for additional eyes to go over the article 
 i will be glad to look at the high school article have you opened a peer review for it if not can you please let me know where to review it it will take me a few days 
 i carried out the changes on the article that you requested i uploaded a fair use cover image and did some c or es have a look and see what you think regards 
 that being said i find it darkly ironic that ed claims it mocks drama when it generates so much pointed mockery of something almost always ends up engendering more controversy than it makes look silly and the attitudes of some offwiki people who also edit on wikipedia arent helping in my humble opinion 
 all that said you are probably right that my comments wont make mongo feel better about whats going on making him feel better in the shortrun isnt my intention with those comments nor is rubbing his face in what he did wrong what i want is for him to stop feeding the drama and then he will feel a lot better when it actually goes away because he will be no fun for them to troll anymore if he takes some constructive suggestions on board then we all win 
 you should weigh the fail vs hold decision carefully it takes N months for a reviewer to get to an article so that leads me to lean toward hold if the editors are willing to work with the reviewer since you have failed the article i would suggest letting someone else have a chance to review the article that decision may automactically impose a serious delay some articles need N or N ga reviews before making it and the article benefits from having different reviewers weigh in thanks 
 uN 
 do you keep your brain in a jar is your iq subzero the answer to both of those questions is no i respect you you seem to act in good faith and you are not attacking anybody no by apologetics i meant that pile of screeddancing bullshit at ed thats supposedly listed as factual as if saying its fact excuses the blatant asshattery they have committed i respect you but there isnt any reason to bother trying to reach out to those people they are nothing but a community of either trolls immature children hypocrites and sadly people who should know better than to frequent a place inhabited by the above but continue to contribute out of what i dont know why you and badlydrawnjeff and others associate with ed none of my business but i do know what ed has decided to do and this goes beyond wiki with other pages they have made is wrong 
 thanks for the clarification i suspect my willingness to associate with ed people makes me a mystery to more than one wikipedian but im comfortable with that i will see you around 
 no you must be beaten with socks for your betrayal of the wikiwiki grins i dont care what people choose to do with their time gtbacchus but i found it vastly upsetting that some people at ed somehow think they are helping situations with their trolling outing people who dont want to be outed is havery very bad anyway have a nice day 
 while i do appreciate that the distinction is made at the beginning of the article i do not feel it is sufficient enough i also feel that the names of leaders of any religion other than the church of jesus christ of latterday saints should not be included in an article titled list of latterday saints there is a reason why there are other articles titled former latterday saints community of christ rigdonite etc it would be entirely appropriate to include those names of leaders on their respective sites and it also means that the lists i have been trying to delete are not lost on wikipedia forever i understand that they are related and the fact that each one of these movements is identified on the article for the mainstream lds church does not bother me because it pertains to the history of the church but these leaders are not famous lds members or former members i would even understand including the very first leader of each separate movement but not each leader those movements have ever had because once they made a distinction between what they believe as opposed to what the lds church believes they would no longer consider themselves latterday saints either please if there is someone else i can communicate with let me know because i am fairly new to this but i do feel strongly about this that i would like someone to consider my opinion 
 there is no controversy as they are clearly visible in the pictures that are in the article 
 razed is a perfectly good word in the english language answering one of your comments wikipedia does not have to be written to be understood at all age levels and education levels that would be the razed is more specific to buildings than demolished is and has a stronger sense of intention 
 i did not say it had to be changed i just said that you guys are arguing over a synonym and it is not necessary to do so i was just annoyed because the two of you are just going back and forth and making it difficult for me to find your talk page as with the enrollment issue it should be clearly cited that the statistic is for the N year and not current it confused me so i am sure it has confused others i just happen to know for a very certain fact that there is one less adolescent to grace rhs with my smile every morning 
 my point is that changing a word for the sake of changing it is not a good reason and yes after the enrollment number it says so that it is clearly dated 
 it may be cited as being from a N report but please then edit it t reflect the fact that the actual reported number is from last year the enrollment of a high school fluctuates drastically from year to year and this may cause confusion i am not an expert with the wikipedia rules so i do not know how this edit should be made but i am asking you to make this change for me you seem to be the editor of the page so i am submitting a request for it to be clarified also once again please do not talk to me about changes being made by this qwetry guy i dont care what you guys talk about but i am trying to discuss the enrollment with you and you are blowing me off 
 again in the infobox after the number N there is a to indicate that the number is from N in the article itself the sentence reads as of N that is standard for wikipedia and for any published source that uses a type of population number the enrollment is never static but to constantly update it would be overly picky and unnecessary the point is to give an accurate not necessarily precise view of the enrollment as for changing drastically every year it really doesnt its largely the same year to year within N either way N years ago the enrollment was right about the same as it is today drastically would be something like dropping or going up by a large percentage changing from N to N is not drastic the last drastic enrollment change was in the N s and N s when kents population increased by a large percentage 
 the text of the article is clear that it is N the problem is that the infobox parameter is different although technically compatible with the article many states have an enrollment census on the first week of school and then do another a month later with the second being used to compute state aid i suspect that even though the report was dated N it was probably based on sept N or october N data the best solution would be to add a footnote to that infobox item thanks 
 the text of the article states through the N school year meaning after the school year nothing in the report states exactly when the enrollment data was collected so we cant speculate based on other states or situations it is also labeled as average daily enrollment suggesting it is not a beginningoftheyear census the bottom line is that if anyone dated the data it would be dated as N since thats when it was released personally i think its geting a little picky between having N or N in the infobox the point is to let the reader know how recent the numbers are if you feel there is a clarity problem between the text and the infobox id just change the article text i wrote through the N school year to avoid another use of as of N which is already quite frequent 
 whatever way school roll is counted in the usa let us not forget that there are also tens of thousands of articles here about schools in other countries the rational presented by jon is logical and is the same that i apply to the hundreds of school articles that i patrol repair devandalise update and write i tend to round the figures up and down using common sense as seen from an encyclopedia readers angle anyone needing more precise information can contact the school or the local authority 
 this makes adding a ref to the enrollment parameter of the infobox all the more important 
 i disagree because it is cited in the body of the article citing in the infobox isnt necessary im not seeing what the problem is here to be honest 
 also in regards to the N to me it looks awkward in the infobox the number in parenthesis should show the year the data comes from it would be one thing if it were a N report released in N but this is a report that was completed in N therefore simply putting N is more than sufficient the fact that some of the data was collected at the end of N is more of a detail rather than an important fact if people want to know the finer details of the state report cards the link is available 
 it makes the adding of a ref to the infobox even less important an infobox is provided as a quick overview it should not offer any information that is not treated in depth in the article approximations are fully in order for infoboxes and it neither necessary nor aesthetsic to clutter them up with references because the ref will already have been supplied in the text and supplied by either the local authority the state school inspection board or failing those the school itself if a school article is complete and well written its history will mention the evolution and growth of the size of the school over time it can be taken for granted that the figure in the infobox was correct at the time the diff was posted if the author was doing his or her research correctly 
 i did not participate in this discussion but i just read your sandbox analysis and i am deeply puzzled i dont have time for a full response right now but i must mention that your interpretation of concision seems especially contrived to favor some predetermined preference in this case i mean concision is clearly defined to mean that shorter titles are preferred among those being considered how this does not favor the one that is clearly the shortest gandhi is beyond explanation of course a full name is concise too but just a surname is even more concise come on there are other similar problems in your analysis but thats probably the most obvious 
 nothing is contrived to favor some predetermined preference because i have no predetermined preference therefore its impossible that i would contrive something for that reason if you think im a biased closer please say so quite directly and i will request review of my close at 
 i have requested review anyway because this is the second challenge to my close 
 i chose my words carefully in particular i did not say anything actually was contrived i said seems especially contrived seems means gives the impression and thats the impression i for one gotwhen you say concision means titles are not supposed to be overly long i believe you are thinking of 
 no i was certainly not thinking of precision i was thinking of concision you seem to be giving the weight of law to the words titles are expected to be shorter rather than longer those words are just something we wrote down one day they were not handed down to moses and its almost entirely certain that they are not the best way of expressing the principles involved to me it is extremely obvious that our policies should not be read legalistically its very obvious that a full name is not a problem under concision its obvious that i didnt ignore concision but that i think of it in a less strictly bythewords way than you do its obvious that my thinking of it that way is reasonable and in line with the intent of the policy regarding the relative weights of criteria those vary from situation to situation in this case none of the titles was a problem under concision so concision weighed nothing also in this case mahatma won under recognizability however the weight of that criterion is diminished by the fairly high level of recognizability of mohandas karamchand gandhi which is very familiar to a large proportion of educated people on this planet 
 ps your warning remember that im in a very privileged position regarding knowledge the original intent of the authors of the principal naming criteria smacks of 
 i dont own it bN c i just know what happened i was there i know that consensus can change but its not clear that it has changed in this case one person interpreted concision according to a strict reading of the words that doesnt mean that consensus favors a strict reading of the words it could just mean that people are easily led by overly rulelooking language we certainly know that to be true its not at all clear that consensus has changed to demand strict literal readings of rules here ie that the lawyers have won it has never been consensus to treat our policies as statutory law because iar still stands as far as the review i always ask for review when my closings are challenged no matter what the challenge looks like its not an escalation and its not a big deal its just what i always do 
 can you provide evidence that someone else somewhere at some time interpreted concision to not mean that shorter is preferred but that titles not be overly long that when none of the titles in contention are overly long even if one is significantly longer than the others that concision does not indicate the shorter title is preferred heck can you provide any evidence that even you ever interpreted it that way before this case 
 no i dont know of any evidence like that maybe i will think of it or find it later but i dont know when this has come up before this experience will provide some evidence of what the community thinks of my reading of the spirit of the policy so far i know that one editor finds it reasonable and one disagrees with it no more have commented yet on that particular point 
 thanks by the way for motivating me to fucking quit working in requested moves i wont because im one stubborn bastard but thats what im getting from this interaction right now i think you should close about a thousand move requests deal with all the static that comes up and then come back and tell me im fucking everything up spit wikipedia is not made of rules and it never will be that is a beautiful thing and one day you will understand this for now just think about how your words come across to other people nobody here is just a screen name we are human beings and we react in predictable ways think about it 
 regardless of the argument and despite the profanity nobody here is just a screen name we are human beings is a profound statement yesterday i too was wondering about the same thing are we just virtual beings with a username 
 i have reread this section and i honestly dont understand how i became a bee under your bonnet or what this has to do with whether wp has rules i simply question your interpretation of the concision criterion to mean that a persons full name is concise and thus the full name 
 i see that none of those titles present a problem in terms of concision im not talking about concision in a vacuum im talking about it as it meaningfully applies to article titles here and the difference in concision between mohandas karamchand gandhi and gandhi is not anything we need to be concerned with neither name falls afoul of the concision criterion i look at gandhi and ask is this concise enough and i answer yes i look at mohandas karamchand gandhi and i ask is this concise enough and i answer yes the point of the concision criterion is not to distinguish between cases like those its to distinguish wordy titles from reasonable ones a full name is not wordy to an extent that we need to be concerned about at all i didnt say that gandhi is no more concise than the full name if all we care about is the definition of the word concise however i dont care one bit about the definition of the word concise except insofar as it applies to article titles on wikipedia in that sense the criterion does not to my mind based on my observations of community decisions distinguish between those two choices if you had never seen a concision criterion written down would you look at a persons full name and say oh thats too long the point of the criterion is to avoid things that are too long the other examples are of course each their own thing madonna louise ciccone is considerably less recognizable than madonna same for liberace both names for bush are fine none of these options that you have presented falls afoul of the concision criterion to my mind based on my observations of community decisions when we wrote that criterion down we werent making a rule we were making an educated guess about de facto naming standards that we were trying to abstract from a thousand varied experiences we with N per cent certainty got it wrong those criteria are guaranteed to be wrong neither you nor i nor anyone has ever actually seen a correct set of naming criteria what i was trying to abstract when i wrote concise on that page was not the difference between mohandas karamchand gandhi and gandhi it was the difference between wordy titles and titles that just get to the point the letter of the law is a terrible approximation of reality and thats why reading policy pages around here is like huffing rat poison its a bad idea if you literally ignore them like the policy recommends and read the community instead then you will be much more on the right page 
 this helps this not a case of literal interpretation which i abhor im just trying to establish what the words means i suggest the current descriptor titles are expected to be shorter rather than longer is overly simplistic inadequate and misleading im sure we could do much better even avoid wordy titles is much better i suggest 
 oh i didnt notice this while posting below i agree that the criterion could use rewording now we are playing the right game use your knowledge of community standards to correct what the rules say and then try not to believe too strongly in what you just wrote down 
 normally id list this request at the requested move page again but really its fairly obvious that the title isnt in line with naming guidelines you yourself moved 
 im about to be inbetween cities for a few days my quick take on this is that we ought to ask 
 thanks for your note on the talk page its a crowded page and i hope the next admin that comes along sees it i am frustrated right now that we have been unable to build consensus on article names on this and a handful of other articles do you know of any admin with extensive experience that can read through the arguments presented and help to decide one way or the other what is the correct name according to wikipedia rules i think we are running into disagreements over the reading of 
 im about to sleep then wake up and catch a flight and then i will be a guest in various homes for a few days before im planted at another net connection so if i dont get a chance to address this concern for a few days please understand that its just life distracting me from the wiki 
 gt i just thought i would come back here after the jb or booyaka situation was resolved and the user banned to let you know i now know which rule i was applying without realising it 
 iar does not obviate the need for verifiability verifiability is nonnegotiable if by preserve the database you mean you want to keep original research on the wiki im afraid we are not going to agree that you are doing the right thing i think everything here needs to be verified or deleted thanks for the update anyway 
 hi you closed the dicussion after someone moved it to 
 got it 
 hi jon i have sent out a friendly request to everyone to continue talking about this school on its tp its not fair using your kitchen as a chat room and anyway with so many people involved the discussion now needs centralising 
 thanks i did already post there though there really arent that many people involved its you me and racepacket kentN eva hasnt edited since the initial edit that i reverted and qwertys edits were not related to the enrollment they were mostly centered around the use of the word razed in the history section if you look at the edit history of the article and the discussion that followed kentN eva was simply editing the enrollment because he no longer attends the school not because of any type of disagreement with or questioning of the source 
 hi jon i meant it generally not necessarily for any specific topics that may arise about the school its just that as you did such a magnificnt job on it you are the magnet for any discussion it used to happen a lot on my tp too until i put a banner on the top what im secretly hoping is to drum up some support for the 
 ok thanks for clearing that up im kind of surprised this particular issue has even come up it just seems so trivial to me i dont see the point of changing it from what it was 
 i agree entirely and yours isnt the only trivial issue thats being discussed to death theres also one here 
 wikipedia is full of trivial matters i have noticed im all for accuracy and clarity but sometimes we get a project or a preference and think thats the way everything has to be thanks for your worki was kind of in a semiretirement maintenance break until the edits came up on the roosevelt article i try to update and help articles as i see them the roosevelt article is the first article i ever started from nothing on wikipedia so im sure some would accuse me of article ownership even then the edits by kentN eva and qwerty didnt surprise me but this has not only that it initially happened but that its taken this much time to explain 
 thanks i saw your note at the cities project talk page too i guess the benefit of it coming out over time is that we wont have to update all demographics sections all at once we can update them as each data set comes out fun fun 
 damn the arb case was closed before i could post a response but 
 mmmmm shoe 
 had some experience with that huh fortunately i dont wear a hat nyuk nyuk 
 we try to cover controversial issues in the neutral manner you describe if you can see where our coverage can be improved we certainly would welcome such contributions im not aware of another website that attempts to provide evenhanded discussions of all sides of controversial topics but then again im here working on wiki and not out there looking for alternatives 
 thanks 
 thats done cheers 
 do you plan on doing a few more as a group nom or are you discussing consolidating the existing noms i would say that the existing nominations should stay separate since theres discussion on those already for additional nominations if you are thinking about doing a groupnom i would wait and see how the current ones end up doing before proceeding if you get all delete results on the ones that are already in play then you should massnom the upcoming ones if you end up with mixed results nominate individually 
 or 
 i just wanted to stap and say welcome to the project please let me know if you have any questions commments or suggestions 
 an ip is complaining that im violating policy by removing unlinked nonnotable band members from the notable natives and residents section of 
 given the notability of the band wouldnt you consider them to be notable natives or residents thanks for your input 
 if the band is notable then the band should be whats listed and the facts that the band was established in new albany that several residents are from the city there needs to also be a reliable source linking the band to new albany an example in 
 i agree with your edit the band should be in the list as the band your interpretation matches my original interpretation but another editor changed it first to delete the entry then to list separately as individual people i will leave it as it is now thanks again for your help 
 as long as its properly referenced in the article it doesnt need to be referenced again i would however recommend just having it mentioned in notable people the arts and culture section is more for events and places people in the town go and do unless those specific events resulted in a number of notable performers or groups then you keep the people in notable people since those people really arent a part of the arts scene in the town as it stands now we have the entire section devoted to things to see and do then a random mention of a band that came from the town notable people is where the towns notable success stories can come into play eventually the section could be written in prose instead of a list (see 
 has a problem it seems to have two smudges a larger one just above an a bit to the left and a smaller one to the left can this be fixed 
 there you go it was a shadow from the big star 
 i havent the time to waste emailing you as i said anything that needs discussing can be done here there is far more to black metal then those two factors cradle is far to accessible to be true black metal seriously buy 
 thats fine but that sentence isnt clear rare were the reviews of her love dont live anymore cover doesnt convey any information about the quality of her performance on that song it just says there werent many reviews why not just cite an actual review or two 
 for 
 i knew they were releasing it in stages so i was checking to see if they had released more thanks for the link many states are listed but not all yet like ohio for instance is not in the drop down menu so either ohio is no longer a us state or they dont have the data glad to see some of the local data is finally coming out thanks for the reply 
 about to find outthanks for the heads up 
 ok i see where you are coming from now its not clear from the way those lyrics are presented that they are supposed to be examples of good writing instead of being further examples of bad writing i understand that you cant say they are good in your opinion but as it is its just unclear whats being said finding a review will be the best solution 
 uN 
 thanks i was just planning on manually updating the sections when the data becomes available the demographics sections should be more dynamic than the raw census numbers anyway according to wpuscity and in most recent fas 
 in my case i have no choice as there is virtually nothing about ohio out in cases where limited info has been released its not an easy choice i want to say update where you can but if you do just be careful to date the info i would also point out any significant changes in demographic data between the last two censuses significant is probably a matter of debate but i see significant as something more than at least N per cent up or down 
 hi timtrent i notice that things have gone quiet on the sea cadet discussion page this is just a courtesy note to enquire whether you have put the discussion to bed after your changes were reverted again i feel strongly that the image is of benefit and the fact that it is from my book of tN pictures is irrelevant i have removed the external links of course i will N per cent accept any formal licence decisions from wikipedia thanks for starting the debate des 
 are you actually aware of image policy restricted use images are not allowed on wikipedia that is why these ones have been listed for deletion they will be removed unless deskN removes restrictions 
 that they will be removed if they are against policy is a given it is not up to the nominator to act as judge jury and executioner though 
 you are welcome to answer your question the only time a title would need something in parenthesis is if there is another article with the same title for example the high school i attended is theodore roosevelt high school there are several schools with that same name so is added to the title in that case (
 sigh i take it you resign your argument just as well uN 
 it has covers on it though we cant say this album is mostly made up of covers where the last one wasnt as it only had two because then wed have to start drawing lines as to where they become mostly cover albums uN 
 im sorry my edit summary didnt adequately explain the purpose of the change i made its to bring this template into line with many other similar ones with the intention of removing the rather fragile dependency on a link to a subheading within the 
 in any kind of notable alumni or notable people lists the general rule of thumb is to wait for an article to be created before inserting them into a list if there is a question about notability these lists arent the place to find out the point of lists isnt to fit as many people as possible who may be notable or have been successful but to connect articles that have an underlying theme in this case the school or town that person is from of course its not an absolute rule but remember rare feat or even highly accomplished doesnt necessarily mean notable player of the year is definitely a rare feat and a great accomplishment most college players though arent notable unless they win several highprofile awards have significant media coverage and or or go pro most division ii athletes dont fit that since division ii has very low visibility even the very best could the player achieve notability sure but be sure to review what 
 being inducted into a local hall of fame is not notable for my own high school the notable alumni section is far smaller than the number of people in the schools hall of fame and every year the latest hall of fame class has an article written about them local hall of fames usually honor a schools most successful alumni but as i have said before being successful doesnt automatically mean notable also with significant coverage did it last long was there ongoing coverage of his career in more than just the local papers notability is also not temporary so having a local story about the poy award is expected even a mention in usa today having a hof story doesnt mean his notability is established because of a time limit either im guessing the story was a local story and no one outside his area knew or cared because many newspapers will publish stories from other sources often times being covered in multiple papers isnt necessarily a guarantee of notability either if you believe he is notable why not start an article or go to an appropriate wikiproject (
 i am willing to accept the removal of the phrase quartercentury reign if you are willing to accept once considered a powerhouse and nbsp for the latin club section both were properly sourced but i see how from your pov that at some point to can become too much lets compromise 
 just in case it wasnt already clear the powerhouse quote was on the page nearly a year 
 on an unrelated note i saw your name on the progressive field scoreboard on tv behind bruce drennan on sportstimeohio 
 as for the quotes i know they are sourced but this is another one of those keeping things in perspective and encyclopedic things bottom line is clubs arent that significant even ones with awesome runs like stow latin taking the roosevelt article through gan showed me that they really dont like a whole lot of details on the clubs since most school clubs have almost no visibility even within their own school its basically highlight significant clubs minimal info about any accomplishments and thats it even though i have kind of cooled off really editing major sections i still will likely trim more out of the roosevelt article before taking it through fac in this case simply presenting the bare facts is all you need to get the point across and keep it encyclopedic using journalistic quotes gives it well a journalistic feel instead of an encyclopedic feel having one journalist using powerhouse rein in an article just seems a bit much to make into the article i would be more supportive if the terms had been used on a much wider scale in the end the N consecutive is impressive on its own so the estra quotes didnt add anything beyond trying to make it look even better let the facts speak for themselves 
 so yes or no you dont agree with me here likewise i dont agree with you im asking for a compromise 
 also you are combining two different quotes from two separate sources powerhouse comes from the beacon journal in N reign comes from cincinnati citybeat this past fall i have removed reign and the cin citation b or c i respect your perspective 
 forget it i have removed both quotes 
 its in no way meant as a sign of disrespect for you as an editor or stow latin club and their accomplishments but the whole gan process and then several later discussions about school clubs that have arisen on the schools wikiproject have really shown that lots of details about school clubs arent what the consensus is looking for in the long run thats not to say we shouldnt have anything about them but for the most part lots of details about specific clubs or teams are going to get removed or at least toned down the reason i didnt edit it until now is just how it worked out i was looking over the page after your most recent edit and felt the quotes werent all that crucial in understanding the main point and came across as unencyclopedic and promotional to be honest i dont think listing every year is really needed either but i will leave that to you while its no ones article you have put far more work and effort into its development 
 quotes are gone the years for certamen titles stay lets move on to more editing and national anthems 
 remember wikipedia isnt a democracy so it really doesnt work simply by compromise content is either appropriate or it isnt consensus is not the same as compromise im not going to go and do a whole bunch of edits to the stow hs article because overall its really not a huge concern or priority for me i make them only when i feel they are absolutely necessary but if you ever want it to progress beyond the cclass article it is i can tell you now that eventually most of the details about the various clubs are probably going to need to be pared down one potential option would be a collapsible chart though thats no guarantee the info would stay through any kind of good article review thats based on my own experiences in many school articles and discussions not just the roosevelt one 
 i know i know i know i just wanted to settle the latin club section between us for now are we settled for now 
 nevermind 
 of course we are settled im just trying to give you some advice to help make the article better 
 and again cheers 
 im going to be taking a break from wikipedia dont feel like theres any rush to complete the assessments alone we will finish it all in good time 
 that one made me smile honestly its like the puppy references i used to exchange with 
 you were right as usual i guess i have finally learned the meaning of sleep on it 
 here its simple but has the target emphasis 
 hmm not quite what im shooting for but its a good start do you think you could create one in the 
 is this too offensive 
 yeah probably the name of vs has already been called into question this kind of icon would probably not help matters 
 how about this no people in the crosshairs 
 hello 
 sorry i havent got back to you right now vs is pretty much on hold during the school year maybe we can talk in the summer 
 thank for your help in moving the article 
 i believe i have merged the old history into the new article if i made any errors that need fixing please let me know cheers 
 looks good thanks 
 and for fixing the redirects too uN 
 see 
 im guessing you dont have anything else to say about grandpa gohan being moved to grandpa son gohan am i right are you at least convinced or moved by what i said on the talk page 
 please be patient im reading your and desirecampbells explanations now 
 okay whats it gonna take to end this senseless dispute a couple more days maybe listen if you were to notice all of the 
 patience grasshopper we are close try not to get wikistressed over it i think we will work something out and its complicated now because we want it to be something that will stick and not just be another headache on another article in a months time thats why its worth it to sit back and carefully think about our reasons for doing things everyone will be better off when we deal with the naming question once and for all i have seen 
 would you like to help improve wikipedias coverage of topics related to the national archives and its incredible collection this summer the national archivesuN which houses some of americas most important historical documentsuN is hosting me as its wikipedian in residence and i have created 
 i have replied to your questions on 
 no problem im in no hurry thanks for the note and i will reply presently 
 hi i replied again on my talk page to your last comment thanks 
 i know this is a lot of favors to ask but can you do some things for me in ibox ty current is there a way to correspond what you put in the winds and what comes out in the current storm status so you dont have to put type and category for the hurricane one is it okay if you add the convert templates in that infobox like in ty current and possibly add the corresponding thing do you understand what im saying if not message me on my talk page thanks 
 yes thats pretty much what i was asking and N more thing i thought about i really feel like the current storm information paragraph is redundant for storms in the nhc or cphc aor can the N kt and N kt wind radii be added to the ibox hurricane current 
 why did you move the page it was against concensus + it contradicts with the name of the city at use english doesnt mean do not use diacritics most of those books cited that use ushak date back to preN s ushak carpet gets N hits whereas uuN fak carpet gets N hits however those that use ushak are predominantly very old books this can make a good case for 
 you are certainly welcome to seek broader input on the question of this particular move the 
 followup i have posted a request for review of my closing in this requested move 
 im just wondering on how you made such a cool signature if you dont feel like answering then thats fine im just wondering on how i can make a cool signature thanks 
 hehe id be happy to help first off go into your my preferences section and make sure the raw signiture box is ticked then but whatever wiki coding you like into there for example if you wanted to make it all small just put metal to the max in there and your sig would come out small its basically the same as just normal wiki coding i usually make my sigs in my sandbox before i actually put it in the preferences so just mess around a bit first until you decide on what you like if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask uN 
 hey sorry for the slow response havnt had the internet all week a load of basic wikicoding can be found at 
 ok sorry to be a bother but as u can see from above the sinebot has been on my back about my signature how do i put a link on it
 i dunno if you have figured it out yet but in case you havnt add four tildes to the end of your talk page comments and your sig will automatically show up to link to you user page you should have something along the lines of 
 hi gtbacchus a user who has been making a lot of edits throughout wpabortion articles recently cited himself (see email listed on 
 hi im the user who has been making a lot of edits thanks for your comment re 
 thank you for weighing in at 
 thanks and more power 
 thanks for the note normally i would just complete the move you suggest as uncontroversial but noting that 
 thanks for the reply anyway i dont think much discussion will be needed since i have found some more evidences that indeed it is officially named asian winter games and it wasnt the other way around not a single edition these articles infobox shows the emblem of the first ever edition 
 i have fixed a lot of your missharpened plant stubs over the last couple of weeks i appreciate you are only trying to help but if you dont have sufficient background knowledge around the various taxa and classifications i humbly submit that it would be better not to do that particular job 
 the abandonment of lamiales is news to me apweb has nothing on it best to take it to our friends at 
 im writing you because we need admin help and you seem to hang out on 
 thanks a lot 
 im trying to contest the speedy i dont understand how a model with N magazine covers movie roles and tv spots a recording contract with blue note records all before creating a hair care line that is still popular with african americans after she sold it is unnotable what gives i have all big name sources for this 
 i have six sourcesgive me examples of what qualifies and i will see what i can find i looking for online copies of magazine articles published about her product unfortunately at the height of her popularity the internet was not commericalized ( so its taking me a minute but im looking 
 regarding your comment that its an entirely trivial question and an unbelievably lame edit war and everyone involved should go to a bar and get a shot of perspective i will point out that the edit war pertained strictly to the cutandpaste nature of the renaming had this been an actual page move i wouldnt have even reverted once without discussion and mdash 
 i still think a drink is in order 
 sorry about the typo with 
 i have replied to you on my talk page regarding 
 looks great thanks 
 hi you removed 
 ok i moved 
 thank you ~ 
 hey im very late here very very busy in rl i just now ran across this thread kinda by accident i really hope you are doing well you are definitely a bulwark of wikipedia best wishes in all things 
 agree with all of the comments above get well soon 
 hey thanks for the move block out to blockout much appreciated 
 no problem 
 please notice that lists of species or genera and alike are not alphabetical but 
 reply to your message on my talk 
 is editing the same articles in the same way that blocked ip N did yesterday 
 i wonder also if this report is correct i can see no evidence of the link between these two ips 
 sorry i have just noticed my typo for the second ip it should be N the particular edits were considered vandalism 
 thanks for coming back but edits of current ip do not seem to be vandalism and even more specifically they are edits from N 
 totally unfair question from a newbie to a more experienced editor i can make some images in autocad that would be an asset on the 
 im not very knowledgable about image file formats i would probably go to 
 note that any nonfree images not used in any articles will be deleted after seven days as described in the 
 marios im afraid i dont know brian mcclair personally i met him some years ago and took a photo to which i uploaded on wikipedia my suggestion would be to contact manchester united directly might be worth starting with the official website http or or wwwmanutdcom or regards 
 im just sick and tired of these anon users making ridiculous and useless edits chances are they will never become constructive wikipedia should make everyone have to register before editing that will definetly take care of people who just want to mess things up 
 i understand your feelings as i am an rc patroller and deal with vandals most of the time but please 
 hi gtbacchus i recently opened a featured article review for 
 no problem cheers 
 i think you are getting too caught up in the taxonomy of literary forms the relevant part of the essay tag is not this is an essay it is it is not a policy or guideline 
 well refraining from tagging it at all might be sufficient tagging it as an essay makes it clearer i can see a new editor coming to the page and if it has no tag wondering what exactly it is i dont know having no tag does have the advantage of being a sort of compromise i guess 
 oh well im not going to war over it if thats what you mean im not up on the current history of the page although i did know it was protected for a while 
 sorry i didnt mean to be redundant i thought it was a totally different area that was not directly linked with the discussion page please delete these pages speedily my bad im having problems finding sources for the coptic articles i went to the pages in search of some good coptic sources i could add to 
 i replied to the following on the articles discussion pages this article has been rated but has no comments if appropriate please review the article and leave comments here to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the article and how best to improve it which i did i dont see why it was deleted because feedback on the articles is requested twice even on the top of the page you should actually remove these request for reviews from the discussion page if they are going to be deleted as soon as they are written 
 no problem i was just sort of frustrated about not finding any coptic sources 
 hi there i was just making my way across wikipedia and stumbled into the tempest over at 
 i guess thats my summary sorry if its longer than you hoped for thanks again for the opportunity to collect my thoughts in one place 
 btw in light of your recent words please take a brief look at 
 just informing you that alecmconroy has filed a 
 its already on my watchlist i may comment there soon im just now writing a comment at 
 id hate to fall out with you over this although im puzzled at your very mild disapproval of behaviour that hurts and humiliates other human beings and at your support for the people who engage in such behaviour i still have a great deal of regard for your kindness of which i saw so much evidence before this very painful case began i ignored your last message to me not because of the content but because of serious issues in my personal life you may have noticed that i disappeared for a month around christmas time anyway id like to email you and id prefer to do it through outlook express which leaves a copy in my sent folder rather than through wikipedia perhaps you could send me a oneliner email i want to say a few things that i cant say in public i did receive an email from you once but its in my old laptop and i dont know if you are using the same address 
 check your email 
 hi thanks for moving three of the brussels municipalities could you move 
 i dont know how i missed that one its done now cheers 
 thanks 
 hi as you were one of the first to assist in 
 sorry and ndash did not realise you were on holiday and ndash ignore this post 
 addressed at users talk page 
 learn not for the sake of simply having knowledge learn for the sake of furthering your understanding of what it means to know anonymous 
 dont worry about it mate we all make mistakes from time to time and hell i have made plenty on wikipedia including misunderstanding rules and such believe me you dont look like a dumbass in the slightest theres been many stupid things i have done on this site so i wouldnt worry about it if you dont make a mistake you dont make anything p uN 
 hey its more than likely that someone else is using your ip address if your computer is used by other people then they may have made such an edit if not its possible that you are using a shared ip as in its an ip used by other people on a network as i believe you didnt make the edits to see what edit was made then its best you just ignore the warning i gave you uN 
 if im being honest i dont entirely know the extent of ips and how they can be shared so im at a bit of a dead end here however if there are any edits of vandalism that i notice coming from your ip i will let you know uN 
 would you like your talk page archiving also with the michael jackson revert you performed id say leave edit summary as it is and warn the user with uwdeleteN template which can be found 
 #for ips who are new to wikipedia i think its important to give the reason for reverting or undoing in the edit summary as well as on their talk page this is especially important for dynamic ips who might never pick up the talk page message however i got tired of typing the same thing onto the end of the standard summary so i have started using the version i used on the edit summary you picked up 
 i have replied to your comment on one of my uncontroversial move requests at 
 thats taken care of the new content at 
 yeah sure i saw it thought it was a nasty comment and remarked accordingly it was certainly visible to the next person who would edit the article and to anybody with the article on their watchlist or watching recent changes if you werent addressing those who would actually see your comment who were you addressing wikipedia is not for hidden editorializing it turns out 
 thanks for weighing in on the dispute over the capitalization of son of god with a note of sanity im guessing you are the author of the note dated N N march N on the easter talk page 
 not sure why you put a warning on my page i havent made more than one edit in any given N hour period anyway i have better things to do than worry about someone injecting pov into a wp page so i have unwatched it 
 ok no problem if you want to send me a draft of your proposed rewrite i will be happy to give my feedback i agree this exercise was largely a waste of energy and im sorry i got involved i really have no particular interest in the topic and i was only watching the page because at some point i had gone there to find out how the date was computed found the existing explanation confusing and rewrote it in a clearer fashion best wishes 
 i have dropped a message on the users talk page asking if they are aware of the move process but thought id contact an administrator about getting some of their questionable moves undone and or or having an admin give them a correction thanks 
 thanks for the headsup i actually reverted the truman move myself when it happened so i guess i have run into this editor before (
 im not sufficiently familiar with the conventions of wikipedia but wouldnt it have been better for you to have done a page move of 
 sure if there had been an edit history worth retaining however it was created shortly before i found it up and moved the content 
 having checked ipni it looks as if passiflora flavicarpa has never been published and it may just be slopppy usage for paasiflora edulis f or var flavicarpa im not convinced that the name even merits a redirect 
 see bernacci et al rev bras frutic N N 
 even though it was listed at uncontroversial moves i have moved 
 cool 
 uN 
 responded on 
 nice job on rm how on earth do you move so fast i dont even have the pages loaded in the time it takes you to finish five moves whats your secret 
 its all about the tabbed browsing thanks for the shoutout d 
 i would signal you the behaviour of 
 been dealt with thanks 
 hi ventolin sorry to say that the c++ is an abandoned unfinished experiment the only working version is the php one 
 i would much appreciate if you took action against this user he has obviously no intent of changing his behaviour around for the better because he thinks no disciplinary action can be taken against him 
 also he was warned about N rr on his account talk page by 
 in the future id encourage you in similar cases to take the lead and state the justification for your reverting on the article talk page this will encourage the other editor to reply there which is generally a step in the right direction away from editwarring and towards discussion 
 thanks a bunch id just like to point out that i did try and take a lead and justify my reverting on said users talk page but on the other hand the revering business had been going on since a while before i wrote that and there should have been discussions on the talk page earlier i realised this from the start but i was just too tired to get into it and hoped that the anonymous user would stop reverting when that didnt happen i posted on his talk page 
 do you think you could add a variable to your geohack to allow the inputted lat and lon to be converted into a

 should be fixed now 
 thank you for fixing and thank you for your great tools in general viele grxfcxdfe 
 could you move 
 i dont know how i managed to forget the talk page thanks for the reminder its done now 
 it wasnt clear to me why 
 huh according to the second paragraph of

 thanks its in

 hi you keep popping up on my watchlist as providing great photos for some of the 
 i will try those after i have gone through my current candidate list if you like feel free to with geographorg as the source 
 thanks for doing some of them i have signed up but when i try to use the automatic upload i always get the error message tusc verification failed and mdash 
 did you get a account for commons and enter that data in the fist form the toolserver doesnt allow me to ask for your commons password so i have to roll my own user verification scheme 
 yep did that and seemed fine until i tried the automatic upload but i will do it again and mdash 
 i am extremely disappointed with your moderation of user pages i dont understand why you believe that you are special and have the right to edit other peoples user pages and talk pages without permission even after reverts have been made you need to rethink what harm is done both by what you are changing to and what you are changing from just because someone involves you in their talkpage doesnt give you a right to moderate it i normally do not take a very active role in wikipedia but on multiple occassions i have been disappointed with your moderation i can only hope you do not let your personal feelings get involved in your moderation please refer to http or or metawikimediaorg or wiki or don per centN t_be_a_dick 
 can you please provide some diffs of this behavior i honestly have no idea what you are referring to 
 spreading the same link across multiple articles is generally considered spam also please see

 your feedback is greatly appreciated 
 i just wanted to take a moment to thank you directly for so quickly responding to my page move request of 
 no problem thank you for helping out with the article 
 hi magnus im a big fan of less edit clutterjs but i think i might have found a bug in it look at these the reference names were removed even though i didnt edit the references section sorry if this isnt the correct place for reporting this and thanks for all the work you do for wikimedia cheers 
 thanks for the feedback i believe i have fixed the issue though it would help if you check as well cheers 
 it looks like it works now thanks a lot 
 hi magnus i have noticed something else in less_editclutterjs which probably wont take so long to fix images at the top of a page appear in the header templates and images only if one uses the image syntax they remain in the main text box if one uses the file syntax thanks again for your work 
 should be fixed now i didnt try it though please tell me if its still broken or if it broke something else 
 looking good thanks 
 you changed the title of the page but did not alter the spelling on the actual page what have you done changing the title for convenience but allowing the diacritic on the page for precision clarify this please also you left links to discussions about diacritics in titles but it does nothing to clarify whether to use them or not it does both and in this case so should reggaetxfN n the accent is essential just like the accents in the uN rxeN sumxeN uN page 
 as for changing the spelling within the article i would have done well to change it when moving the article and you are right to point that out to me i will fix it now 
 you shall be corrected i found many english pages searching for uN creggaetxfN nuN d on google the first page and more the second page and many others third page has a lot too you werenuN t searching right if youuN re going to argue in favour of the anglicised spelling uN creggaetonuN d on the page youuN re going to have to debate that so far you have no reason 
 excuse me but im not trying to argue for an anglicized spelling im just trying to get the page titled according to common usage i have no stake in what this page is called and dont care which name turns out to be more common we got different google results because you included quotation marks and i didnt not realizing that they would affect the results for a singleword search i was using the best information i had available look at my search results you dont need to tell me that i have no reason as if i was somehow acting in bad faith im giving my time to help maintain this resource and i dont appreciate being talked down to alright 
 i have started a new section at 
 hmm looks like i left your talk page on my watchlist after leaving a comment above but i left an explanation of the effect quotes have on single word searches on the reggaeton keep up the good work on the page moves 
 talk archives cant be deleted for gN 
 it wasnt a talk archive it was a redirect 
 the logic still applies for a redirect as well as the further explanation given at 
 bollocks the redirect is utterly useless nothing links to it noone will ever arrive at the target page via it you have restored it not because you think it is useful because because you are unable or unwilling to step back from the ludicrous absolutes you have been uttering like redirects for talk page archives should never be deleted i couldnt care less that you have restored it but please dont try to pass it off as you correcting oics error 
 uh what as someone whos done a lot of work on other wikis i can assure you that i have restored because i do believe them to be useful forgive me for my earlier comment as i meant to say they should never be speedy deleted redirects are cheap they are convenient and we cannot track offsite links im annoyed at the systematic deletion of redirects that are there for these very reasons if you have taken that as me having some talk page redirect complex then im sorry that i gave that impression 
 nice to see you editing in article space we have been chipping away at your compiled obi list can you believe its almost done 
 N biographies sounded a lot at back then i think i will help writing the remaining ones even if its only longer stubs has kind of a fullcirclefeeling about it 
 hello i was working on the article

 you are welcome to let me know about similar situations i have been doing a lot of page moves for the last few months so im fairly practiced when it comes to history merges and the like posting requests at 
 looks like this matchbox twenty thing is going into overtime after all is there any way to get rid of that unless it is unique bit in 
 yeah the unless it is unique phrasing isnt even clear i noticed there are already a couple of talk page topics about that sentence but i need to do a little more reading before i dive in

 could you add gxeN oportail ign to geohack the problem may be to link geographical coordinates and zoom level to a coded line parameter to geoportail example municipality of 
 sorry magnus i couldnt resist taking a look at this one turns out its a long baseN encoded parameter where the scale value is between N and N from wikipedia scales thats something like logN i put up a redirecting tool on the toolserver with that logic and hope the reference grid is the same as here seems to be working at a few test points at least 
 please have a look at 
 solved it was a redirection problem at spanish wikipedia thanks 
 oh im not faulting you at all im just worried that we are only just starting to air out our arguments and suddenly theres this N daysleft time bomb and i know its just an informal survey to see where everyone stands but im concerned we might have people on either side say oh my side won N we are totally moving it to matchbox twenty but i appreciate the idea id just personally have wanted a bit of a longer wait in a few days we may well have all the arguments clearly laid out and then i will feel comfortable make a vote cheers 
 i definitely dont think of it as a binding vote and no decision will be made based purely on numbers i also wouldnt worry about the fiveday limit we are pretty flexible with that sort of thing at 
 thanks 
 i appreciate the change you make when i try the ajax preview w or refs button it works 
 would you say qualifies as deliberately creating history 
 i cant really say it isnt but whether i would actually say it is in order to exploit a loophole in some arbcom decision no i wouldnt say that i would just rfc the page and tap into the community which is either broadly against eccentric typography or else we ought to know that the climate has changed which would be a shame imo 
 sorry about that that was more for my purposes than anything else just that lately i have done quite a bit of cleanup vandalism fighting maintenance etc and been falsely accused of breaching N rr twice 
 hi we have a problem with your bot that could result in featured pictures getting deleted your bot has moved 
 hi durova first i am traveling right now will be back at home next week second i am very sorry if the bot ate some text do i understand correctly that the problem stems from someone using the bot to upload an unsuitable image to commons i can block or allow images with certain templates for commons transfer i just need to know which ones also the bot has grown to a state where the current freetext parsing doesnt cut it anymore i am working on a successor bot but im generally busy with other things so progress is slow 
 im all in favour of not humouring trade mark holders and if someone notifies me that there is another requested move on that page then i will express that opinion i am well known for not liking funny foreign squiggles on words but yesterday i did not move 
 yeah you seem to be taking a stand for bowing to consensus over guidelines i try in handling move requests to pay attention to a broader consensus sometimes than is represented on the talk page in question in this case as i told tj spyke above i think it would be appropriate to set up an article rfc to get a wider opinion on the matter because im pretty sure the general consensus is against such renderings of titles 
 i have a question regarding is it possible to pass a parameter or argument in a url that will automatically untick use wikisense to suggest categories and tick aremove existing categories i already use url to pass a few settings 
 try 
 that works thank you for the help 
 gracias for being impartial on the reggaeton situation if you look at the evidence that i have presented over the last couple days along with that of other spanish speaking contributors i think you will find it evident that the articles title is presently accurate as it relates to common and popular usage since you are an admin i will have to ask does using a sockpuppet to vote warrant a banning since that seems to be whats going on over on the talk page anyway thanks for being a good admin 
 you really need to quit making such libel comments you have no proof of what you claim and iuN ve already stated the truth however you can be banned or blocked for starting an edit war which is exactly what youuN ve done despite being warned by the way you have offered no support for the anglisised version youuN re all talk but no show 
 do an ip check on noes account and the other one and the ips will be related if an article has a particular title it makes sense that the title word be correctly spelled throughout the article thats common sense so if i ensure that this happens any edit i make like that is not remotely vandalism or starting an edit war its keeping the article correct as decided by the consensus on the talk page the article has read as reggaeton for years unless the title is changed by a consensus vote the content of the article should remain unchanged as it has always read furthermore noe should refrain from abandoning the talk page to ask other contributors to block the page or encourage them to delete my supporting facts on the talk page 
 when you view the talk page for reggaeton be sure to click on the history tab to look at the most recent additions as opposed to whats presently up there all new facts links and examples that noe asked for that support why the present page title is correct are being deleted so that other users cant see them 
 hi im wondering if 
 should work again now 
 great stuff could you also add in the human name disambiguation pages category as a trigger thanks again 
 done 
 i was aware of certain ip edits before i unblocked the user ideally both of you would walk away from the juggernaut article since a friendly compromise seems unlikely it appears thats not going to happen so i only ask that each of you stays as focused as possible on future options rather than past events 
 agreed im certainly trying regards 
 for a userbox you can add to your userbox page see 
 you deserve more than one uN 
 thanks to keeping an eye on this page there has been an ongoing problem with this kind of ip vandalism 
 i dont think it would be very um cool of me not to keep an eye on it 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the 
 i have also proposed the deletion of 
 cheers 
 i tweaked commonshelper so it should now translate bildpdus to pdusgov as to the general workflow i know theres lots of things waiting in jira but somehow i can manage to avoid looking at them for month 
 in case you are interested theres discussion 
 i wont be spending havery many hours online for the next few days but i have watchlisted the talk page in question and i will definitely check in occasionally good luck with your paper 
 thanks a lot 
 done 
 i beg you for your help 
 hi mackan im in a situation where my internet access has been very limited for the past few days please dont think im ignoring you when i get my regular connection restored this is at the top of my priority list 
 thank you although i have absolutely no desire to i feel myself being dragged into several edit wars i do not want to revert the edits but i feel i am left with little choice when japanese revisionists suggest the N N sex slaves employed by the japanese military were prostitutes i hope for an intervention from an admin as soon as possible 
 if you see this but still are unable to do something about the problem i would much appreciate if you could direct me to somebody else who could i dont know where i should turn but this edit war must stop 
 you tagged this as an a and speedy if you read the article about the author youd see it was notable but since it contained very little text i have redirected the article if you come across anything similar redirecting and or or merging might be a good idea 
 i dont think every book by a notable author is itself notable and the authors article gives no hint that this one is especially so but a redirect is fine too uN 
 thanks for note i imagine mr stanton is pretty upset right now and asking him for a photo would be insensitive i will look through my archives and see what i have maybe after the screaming and hollering quiets down my emotions arent under control yet and i need to maintain npov there are still a few choice words i mean to share with the council on the matter im glad to see the article is up though 
 btw they have not allowed that frivolous information to be reposted to prince williams page suggesting it was not pertinent to his actual relationship with his new bride why even comment to me if you are aware they have removed that information reliably sourced does not mean reliably inserted 
 as for signing theres an icon at the top of the edit window showing a little pencil beside a scribble that inserts the signature code for you 
 hi magnus metawatchlist isnt in the jira system so im writing here thanks for the excellent idea but could you create an option to hide certain edits thanks 
 hi waldir thanks for the suggestions i will implement them as soon as my overfull schedule allows the list entries are already doubleclickable and should open the respective diff if your browser i tried to put individual links into the list entry but that didnt seem to work 
 thanks for the quick answer i will be looking forward to the new features however the doubleclick doesnt seem to work here you might want to look into that 
 could you please point out to tropicaljet et al that what i wrote here in no way constitutes a personal attack while no serious editor would label it as such i fear somebody who only skims through what i wrote might be mislead by their comments 
 all confirmed sockpuppets were duly blocked and you can consider this case closed for now thank you 
 the first move was agf but now hes beign difficult and demainding his hwhim as consensus even though neither before nor now does he have aggreement he needs a reprimand 
 actually in 
 are you kind enough to give me the source of this file i would like to run it for viwiki but currently your doesnt support that project and doesnt have it thank you 
 i have added viwikipedia to the list and started the update process so it should show up in the regular tool soon and will be updated daily i am currently organizing the svn this particular tool consists of a frontend an update script a wrapper script and a cronjob entry spread over several directories some of my code includes hardcoded passwords i will make all code available as things progress unless you really need the code urgently now please give me a few days 
 thats too much for me when you add viwikipedia to the list thank you very much 
 ok its live 
 i see a couple of problems with this paragraph first of all that link to western world makes no sense what is being claimed here second that external link is in japanese and i cant read it what information am i supposed to be using that link to verify anyway the url looks commercial is that a website selling something or what linking to the japanese wikipedia is also problematic but my first question about it is what article is that can someone provide some hints for the linguistically limited like myself id like to figure out what all there reversions are about 
 yakiniku is a meaning of roasting meat though it is a fundamental matter and yakiniku is a custom of starting at the 
 i added you as a editor who may be able to help with questions about verification and sources for 
 alright man thats cool no problem at all thanks ^_^ uN 
 hello and sorry for not coming here earlier to discuss your closing of 
 hi thanks for the note i guess im not seeing what the argument is for using the diacritic in this persons name according to what people were saying in the move discussion the media as well as the subject himself use the rendering delic thus according to 
 you are not the first to disagree with this aspect of our naming conventions and if you look at the talk page of the guideline on diacritics you will see thousands of words of debate on the subject i dont think it would be appropriate for me to move this article back against our usual practice unless its either demonstrated that the form with the diacritic is the common english usage or else that the community deems the case worthy of making an exception to that end you are welcome to file a content 
 i was going to post this on jira but it isnt a bug or feature request at least not yet is it possible to pass commonshelper N the parameters i used with the first commonshelper as shown 
 try 
 that appears to work thank you for the help and thank you for writing both commonshelpers 
 hi gtbacchus im glad to report that a few editors not affiliated with wikiproject abortion recently helped us to complete our assessments uN thats one thing scratched off of our todo list however theres been a few ongoing disputes in the project including at 
 hi severa i have added both of those pages to my watchlist and i will have a look at the situation i should have some time either before or after the weekend 
 thats alright im going on vacation fridaysunday so i wont be available until next week really anyway i appreciate your taking the time to weigh in on any of these matters thanks again 
 at first i was going to post this on but at it is not a bug or a feature request and i would like 
 hi commons is our shared free media repository thus images with a free license should be on commons rather than on a specific wikipedia as this benefits all wikipedias and users beyond that said there are a lot of exceptions specific to individual wikiedia projects some projects have decided not to store local images at all and use commons exclusively most like enwikipedia allow either some files cannot be transfered to commons at all for example 
 thank you very much for your explanation 
 i tried to ake a discussion but really there isnt a lot to discuss the term rubin prefers is not common and only a recent neologism by a ceo of a domain company he seems to admire every other source in the field uses the other term freaking 
 per your comment on my page pretty much yes the two articles do not differ much and the points on which they do differ are incorrect opinions of some people who want to make domain kiting into a real term note that even the content at domain kiting says domain tasting is the proper term the only possible pointof dispute is whether domain kiting is a new and valid term for some subset of the more common domain tasting even if it were which i would strongly argue against domain tasting is the clear main topic with kiting as an offshoot attempts to get rid of tasting completely by the admin so that the word can be a different one that he himself wants to become prevalent is simply not how things are done here hes trying to force his opinion of what the term should be onto the rest of the world 
 the only way i would agree to stop reverting is if its guaranteed that the articles be locked as they are now with domain kiting redirecting to domain tasting and that the admin wont use his admin powers to undo it even while locked reverting is just like any other edits here and when it needs to be doneit should be done asking for the page to be wrong and the information to be wrong just to avoid upsetting people who dont care if its wrong is not a good strategy wikipedia seems to be set up so that anyone who prevails in running through red tape long enough can win even if they are wrong we need to have the content be right or else theres no point to it 
 i also 
 thanks i have started to participate in afds a lil but i still need to take a more active role in them thanks again uN 
 i have to say that you handled thelatesrt move request rather poorly as yyou allowed people to claim that the term was common while not asking any of them to follow wikipedia policies on verifiability and reliability furthermore you closed the thing within a manner of few days without getting comments from others who had recently commented there as well as outside respected editors who could have come in to help out so all we get is a couple of people claiming it needs to stay with no evidence ignopring clear evidence to the contrary and you just up and close it very poor call i must say 
 i closed the move request in the prescribed time and based my decision on every word that was typed in the designated section if you want to become an admin close move requests every day and seek out and read all of the context of each one even when people dont bother to register an opinion in the survey then please be my guest im a volunteer and im batting about N so i will sleep just fine knowing you think i made a bad call have a nice day 
 hey magnus you coming to the next meetup if you are i will be bringing some 
 now theres an argument just signed up 
 the image you used was N and deg counter clockwise from the correct orientation please correct this 
 i have already added a rotate template to have it botrotated you could have done the same thing with less keystrokes than leaving me a message 
 i did not notice that you had responded to my message until today 
 could you take a look at 
 i removed the controversies section since it was only citing youtube and a bloggish post to support the entire section there have been plenty of complaints of inaccuracies regarding the images that show planes hitting the pentagon and wtc towers but none of it has ever been seen as credible or even noteworthy people who know little about relatively mediocre security cameras such as the ones that barely captured the images of the plane which hit the pentagon use that as evidence that the images were doctored 
 thanks i was halfway towards removing the youtube link and the source for it but thought id ask you first 
 nahbe 
 thanks for your contribution to the discussion at 
 since the above i have changed one of my replies to you so if you have read them already you might want to check back didnt read carefully enough sorry 
 appears to be fixed now 
 jimmy wales will be speaking at 
 thanks for the note dmcdevit i would have to take the train down to portland after work and then hurry back the same night so i doubt i will make it making this the second time i have missed jimbo in portland since moving from there to seattle last summer doh 
 quick question about your excellent tool is there a way to make it so that if a field is left blank that field is not added with the blank parameter in the final output but instead is simply omitted thanks for your time 
 also some sort of clear button to clear the fields out when done would be very helpful 
 hi there i noticed you moved the hci article from the endash version to the hyphenated version as an uncontested move id like to contest it citing the discussion from july N 
 im sorry but i cant tell which article you are talking about i move hundreds of pages can you provide me with a link 
 never mind i found it at 
 ich wollte mit deinem wirklich tollem commonshelperN das bild globespingif von der engl wikipedia nach commons rxfcberschieben und bakam dann die fehlermelung unknown tag span aber die fehlermeldung auf dem offiziellen wege abzusetzen ist fxfcr den laien ein ding der unmxfN glichkeit bie der meldung reporter is required muxdfte ich aufgeben 
 sollte jetzt funktionieren 
 it may interest you that the article you recently created is virtually a duplicate of 
 actually i made the page you created into a redirect if thats okay with you the two are identical 
 that is fine i was about to do that anyways sorry for tha ti did not know of the other page as nothing was linked to it 
 he copied the article 
 the article has been removed from his userpage 
 try the 
 i have taken a trip in the wayback machine and am overwhelmed let me be a little more specific i have never worked with oggs and even find getting copyright permission for photos a daunting task i looked at the information on the site and still dont know what im doing plus i do not have sound on my computer help help help 
 well i didnt create the file i just copied it the original site is gone so the link to the license leads to nirvana which is the problem replace it with the link to the wayback machine which is a perfect copy of the site at the time and contains the license that should do it unless there are complications you didnt mention 
 thanks very much for the help and mdashi pasted in the new permisssion file as you suggested is there any other music by rimskykorsakov that could be converted into oggs and used in the article as i menteioned earlier i have never worked with oggs so i have zero capability for doing this myself thanks again 
 thanks again for all your help just one more question how would i fix the is interchangeable link on the bumblebee ogg 
 fixed 
 thanks very much 
 on what makes a source reliable see 
 hello gtbacchus i see you around from time to time and i have been looking at your user page and see that you are a member of 
 nobody can keep up with all the stub types i generally pick a nice general one like in this case and then look in the category 
 thank you very much i have added and i hope not to leave it as a stub for too long and it will probably be quite easy to get reliable information about it in the next few weeks because dr billings died a few days ago so his work is being reported in the media more than it usually is 
 thank you so much for joing the discussion over on 
 you might reveiw and see 
 scott would you mind not making personal attacks against me on other peoples talk pages thanks 
 it wouldnt matter much if you slandered radiant to me i wouldnt believe you i already know hes one of the good guys as are you netscott on point i will be checking out 
 always loved geohack i notice it is gpl thought id query its use here anyway for the project do you think it would be suitable for the purpose of giving outside resources from a location on a wms map served from the exploration commons site might geohack be too wikipedia specific or is it possible to insert it into a running installation of mediawiki 
 first fell free to use geohack under gpl im sure it will have its use outside wikiedia as well when you look at the code you will see that it was originally an extension and i hope it will run within wikipedia one day for now im not sure it will work as an extension out of the box but it shouldnt need too much fixing also feel free to link to the existing installation but be aware that the url will change in the coming months 
 fictionh keeps trying to add that the episode 
 he called me an idiot for his edit i didnt even notice that there was a 
 thats about as much sense as it all makes to me my suggestion is just to copy his user page wholesale and then make small changes until it becomes your user page being sure not to break any of the mysterious code if you need someone to look over your code i could maybe proofread it but like i said im no expert i hope that helps 
 do you need any other page to add es version to your tool 
 thanks for that and 
 hey magnus i thought id note to you as it involves one of your tools hope you are doing well 
 thanks fixed 
 ta 
 the debate seems to be about whether we should give suggestions on how to poll but thats not actually the case nobody denies that we should and 
 how do you feel about the idea of making a single page 
 when i did the move 
 see nobody seems to actually oppose this idea is it just a matter of somebody taking the initiative and refactoring the two pages into one 
 indeed once there is a consensus to do that N N april N 
 and thats determined how 
 well through discussion of course lol do you think radiant would ever participate in a poll of course polling on a page thats a guideline on polling is logical N N april N 
 it appears the opposition is coming from grace note and guy actually i think a poll would be rather unhelpful at this point 
 i have left notes at 
 talking about march N 
 now confirmed 
 that is the namespace in the urls cannot be translated or translations can be used only in language sections corresponding to the interface language 
 should be fixed now 
 you were kind enough to post a message on my talk page re article telectronics at N N july if you have time could you please have a look at my last edit of telectronics discussion bottom of page in which i ask wikipedia people with more knowledge of procedures to give advice to me either directly or by referring me to someone who might be able to help regards and best wishes with your studies 
 i would familiarize yourself with 
 what relevance does this have to me 
 you write on user talkjoanjoc i have under my account it doesnt work after the cloning can you fix it 
 should work now 
 if you have uploaded other files consider verifying that you have specified sources for those files as well you can find a list of files you have created unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged per wikipedias 
 thank you 
 feel free to add it yourself to 
 i created a new article for 
 ill do it momentarily 
 since hes got plenty of source material i may build him up myself to startclass and get the dyk so dont go too far yet thanks again dude pleasure to watch you work 
 hi magnus a very minor bug in catscan N if you eg use it to look for pages in 
 should be fixed 
 thanks for the award i really appreciate it so from a saw fan to another have you seen saw iv 
 nope not yet it pained me greatly to have to go into work today when i could be watching it so im watching it tomorrow instead possibly twice p have you seen it if you have please do not reveal any information about it uN 
 i just came back from seeing it all i will say is go see it i hope you become an administrator id be cool to have someone to protect saw related articles but i hope you get it 
 thanks and yeah i will be sure to watch it tomorrow possibly more than once p uN 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or thank you for your tools treeviews baglama and glamorous 
 thank you 
 done and your english is fine 
 hello magnus i added the complete macedonian translation of catscanN on 
 see my reply on meta 
 hi i came across your user page and i saw your big missing list why didnt you let me know can you check something for me is 
 i just imported and formatted these lists i have no idea what the correct entries would be the way to find out is looking them up in the real dnb i guess sorry 
 thanks for your help in rewording this section i feel that expanding on the rule would reduce controversy since there have been many reported incidents where iar has been used wrongly i was hoping that elaboration would clear a lot of the misconceptions people take about this policy by giving them more to look at 
 i think that purpose is served to some extent by iars talk page i look forward to seeing you there 
 hi there i hope you dont mind but i have considerably restructured 
 thanks always looking for people to organize my junkyard 
 hi magnus could you take a look at i think that lec removed a reference group name and a reference name thanks much and love the script 
 i dont think it supports the group attribute and maybe has problems with hyphens in the name will fix later when i have time 
 i believe i fixed the issues also i now move more stuff into the header section as by example of the page you gave 
 looks good so far thanks again for the excellent tool 
 it concerns me that you werent aware of 
 the best response is to get quickly to a forum where admins are certainly available around the clock the first thing to come to mind was an or i but as you pointed out thats fatally flawed i think a batch of emails or a visit to irc would be a good next step revert warring without the power to win quickly and decisively is actively harmful because of rc revert wars attract attention 
 you have a reply waiting for you at 
 is it 
 im not sure if its been brought to your attention yet but 
 actually thats inaccurate i have never responded that way in an afd and i never would i have responded that way at ucfd which 
 my bad i was referring to ucfd yes they arent specifically mentioned in 
 the only reason i can see for not allowing people to do what they want with user categories is if they are hurting the project in some way if we are going to disallow some then we ought to disallow them all theres no excuse for standing anywhere in the middle choosing to approve some peoples unencyclopedic categories and not others 
 and now you move onto 
 what i see is people telling others what to do with no projectbased reason wikipedia is not an exercise in governance and ucfds attempts at governance are upsetting contributors so whats its excuse wheres the benefit that outweighs that disadvantage 
 besides i really dont see the point of keeping the categories for a reason based upon 
 its a totally arbitrary exercise is telling others what to do deleting frivilous user categories doesnt help the project and it bugs people who work on the project therefore it seems harmful to me 
 N N julyN 
 do you own the copyright to the image or is it just some image you found on the web that youd like to have on wikipedia 
 N N julyN 
 well since this is a living person and 
 indeed i have i will tell you know the ending made my brain stop working for a few minutes although based on hoffmans actions in saw iii the twist with him wasnt much of a surprise to me uN 
 i know he did look a little suspicious in saw iii at first i thought art was the one who was going to continue jigsaws work but theres always that twist question in saw ii it was revealed that amanda was going to continue with jigsaws work but in saw iii she dies my question is since she has a page of her own would it be sufficient to create one on hoffman 
 with the revalations in saw iv i think it would be quite sufficient to yes i was also surprised that rigg didnt have his own when i have more time i will get onto the latter if it hasnt already been done uN 
 ok cool yeah cause i was going to bring it up in the saw iv talk page but then i realized that some people may not have seen the film so i just left it if youd like i will help 
 well you can get started whenever you like most of my editing dedications at the moment are waiting for my weekday internet to get fixed so its a lil hit and miss at the moment uN 
 regarding and your comment right above thank you for actually getting it and even more importantly trying to spread the understanding to others 
 you are welcome thanks for your note 
 best regards 
 hi i just need to add a few parameters for each language once i have done so for pt it should 
 thank you 
 i think that we may agree on more user category issues than you would suspect i agree with you that the majority of user categories as is probably dont help facilitate collaboration thats exactly what im trying to change however by nominating so many i dont think that just because a majority of them dont now we should let any and every nonsensical user category be created and kept change is a slow process and i believe i and the others at ucfd have slowly but surely helped make the user category system much more useful than it ever was and will continue to do so until people start seeing categories as a means of collaboration instead of a myspace variant i highly encourage you to help us with this process by nominating any categories you deem to not facilitate collaboration saying keep for categories being harmless however certainly will not improve the system and i will discount any such votes on sight as i would suspect every other ucfd regular would do as well 
 it just seems really weird to me now that we are deleting the hahafunny categories but keeping the potentially destructive ideological categories which are no more encyclopedic what kind of goal have we got in mind for user categories and how are we supposed to get there im willing to help but at this point i dont get it 
 i dont think thats a terribly bad idea although id think some people prefer user categories to wikiprojects because they are less formal and dont necessarily want wikiprojectbased messages left on their talk page all the time categories are also used when looking for someone with particular expertise on an issue that pertains to an article stuff like this is the key goal for user categories hence my comment of unencyclopedic as justification to delete many categories for instance you arent going to have a reason to go looking through 
 i would estimate this is now occurring in N per cent of instances repeated attempts will overwrite the page eventually with the upload required but it is becoming increasingly time consuming and irritating has the new look wikimedia commons page buggered up the bot 
 hi maybe im slow but i cant find anything wrong with since there are no other edits for the page not other uploaded versions of the file id say the upload succeeded on the first try clearly im missing something 
 it did subsequently succeed on the ninth attempt let me see if i can find one that i gave up on for you to have a look at 
 try 
 i have begun an investigation it does not seem to be a fault of my tool rather the toolserver or commons upload or a strange combination of both i will keep you informed 
 whatever the reason wikimedia commons seem to have reverted their page format and the problem seems to be no more everything seems to be working first time except for the trelowarren house image which still wont load 
 this user is a return abusive sock please lock the talk page 
 already done 
 i had to repeatedly unlink a 
 the image with the penis is deleted i wouldnt worry about the N rr reverting vandalism is certainly an exception and that image was definitely vandalism if the image reappears or if you need any more assistance please let me know thanks for helping out 
 you need to reread the policy on civility you continuously attack the messenger rather than the message you defintiely should know better so i wont remind you again thanks 
 would you care to point out where i attacked you is it a personal attack to point out that you have failed to respond to a particular argument i certainly dont wish to make any claims about you as a person and i dont believe i have i hope you will point out to me what was uncivil about my message otherwise im puzzled 
 i have thought about it i can see no reason to link to attack websites 
 for the umpteenth time neither can i im against linking to attack sites i do find it frustrating that you seem incredibly eager to do something that will areduce security without even responding to the suggestion that it will do so i dont think you have addressed the argument that i have made and i do think you are pursuing a goal that will turn around and bite you in the ass its because i dont want that to happen that i oppose the policy in question im trying to protect wikipedians and not to set out pots of beans why why why wont you even address this point why do you shoot yourself in the foot why i dont imagine its intentional but will you even consider that i might be making a point worth thinking about again i am fully against linking to what you call attack websites i note that your calling them that is hurting your position you dont have to care but id think you would you dont have to put effective protection in place but id think you would you can undermine our security but id think you wouldnt want to 
 i created a tusc account using enwiki before i created one with commons now i have N tusc accounts one of which is useless can you please delete it and mdash and nbsp 
 sure but if i may ask why 
 i created the enwiki one because i wasnt aware you needed to use commons now i have a duplicate account which is useless and mdash and nbsp 
 thanks for fixing my newbie mistake 
 no problem im always especially happy to help out with beatles articles 
 hi when deciding what the most common name is we always look at what the most common name is among a subset of englishspeakers it can be academics journalists etc depending on what the appropriate subset to look at is usually we want knowledgeable people people who care about accuracy people agreed that taking all english speakers the most common name was san sebastixeN n but that probably wasnt the case among toponymists why are toponymists not the experts we should look to 
 all that said if you want to propose a move to 
 okay i accept that this case is analogous to species names 
 thanks fixed 
 yup seems to be back and working thanks for that ultraefficient as always 
 thanks for reverting at 
 i have deleted that thanks for the headsup 
 and thanks for your quick response 
 greetings sorry to bother you here i have been using the missingtopics tool for years to generate 
 i dont think i changed anything there since november maybe some temporary toolserver issue or the root category name has changed try again maybe just with a subcategory if it still doesnt work try just to see it it works 
 no i cant get either of those tools to work with the amharic wikipedia any more it doesnt seem to be able to read the amharic font any more thats a real shame because this was a great tool and i dont know any other way to get a current list of redlinks for the wiki 
 please when you have a moment come over and look at the nonsense going on over here 
 thats taken care of thanks for the headsup i have blocked the account as apparently used only for vandalism and deleted all the spurious image uploads now it looks as if the user made no contributions which i guess is just as well 
 that is just fine by me thank you for the quick action though one suspects that a person who had that much fun vandalizing will return 
 hello again over here 
 when it comes to ip addresses its hard to tag them as socks because they dont necessarily stick to the same computer and then we get collateral damage i notice that the ip in question is currently for N hours maybe that will suffice i have watchlisted the talk page too lets see what happens 
 this seems like a sound course of action i will keep an eye on it as well and we will see what happens thanks again for your time 
 hey thanks man the guys i vandal i just undid two consecutive vandalisms of his are you an admin thanks 
 dang your fast i was going to rvv your page too but you got there first 
 im keeping tabs on him dont worry btw yes i am an admin 
 i want to ask that is it just for enwiki i cant use it in zhwiki 
 there seems to be an issue that on enwiki the jquery object can be accessed as $ while on other wikis it cannot i will look into it 
 ok i have got it running on dewiki it should run on zhwiki but might have funny side effects for example large images instead of thumbnails where the zh translation of thumb is used 
 i have also got it running on zhwiki but i cant use the 
 {{{icon or 
 im pretty familiar with the warning templates thanks a cursory glance at my history would reveal that i have used several this evening i dont always use them when an ip with no prior history blanks a page im pretty likely to skip it anyway thanks for being alert 
 sorry for a lot of comment i want to report to you that it will mix the vector infobox try to edit with installing this script and use vector skin click advanced in the edit toolbar > the create form button or the link button on the edit toolbar you may see some style problem i am very sorry for leave you a lot of comment however may you fix them someone are now promo this tool on chinese wikipedia vp 
 if you need i can provide the chinese translation

 woo ^_^ uN 
 yeah i think saw i was the best but i still love all the others hehe and i loved the code you left p uN 
 lol i was kidding hmm i wonder which code you could find in a sentence which didnt have one cheers 
 i dont agree with a review being added to fit coheeds genre the band should be what they describe themselves as which is progressive if the band say they are progressive let it be the best source for a genre is what they say themselves and have they said anywhere themselves they are emo a source which is not themselves should only be used to describe a bands genre if no official website of them can be found to describe their genre but in this case they have described themselves as progressive and only other people have described them as emo opinion uN 
 i actually have started writing a section that would explain how some people claim them to be emo some say that they arnt and some say they are progressive or whatever and under the band table at the top have it say distputed subgenres with a link to the section however there are a few flaws with the emo catagory first off the band dont sing about emotional themes as bands in the emo genre do they sing about 
 cant test because http or or wwwgeographorguk or photo or N says offline 
 now sorted geograph bot got it where human efforts failed 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our 
 this seems to be an error i clearly am not the one who uploaded that image i have left a note at the bots talk page 
 apologies for the rapidfire reverts if it appears that i was acting hastily wrt to warning or reporting the ip in question it was due to the fact that 
 point taken and understood mate thanks gotta save the columbiformes 
 usually how long its from something in jira to start resolving problem because its more than week and no respond 
 im a volunteer so it takes as long it takes i have quite a few jira tickets dating back several months but thats far from my only wikipediarelated backlog then there is work and wasting time on things like eating and sleeping if i give precedence to the people who complain loudest all i will get is everyone complaining loudly so to answer your question two years maybe sooner maybe not 
 ok i was just asking because i don`t know have i should check status of defect every day or every month now its clear that every year it will be quite ok ] 
 i dont know why i received this message but i have deleted the redirect in question now 
 this actually redirects to 
 damn im history 
 with many thanks in advance 
 many thanks i will remember the difference sorry again for the trouble all the best 
 also http or or wwwgeographorguk or photo or N 
 hmm it like that one worked many times 
 ha this is one of the problems of course there is no way of telling whether the image has crossed over or not when this happens the link to the image page is missing and if you search wikimedia commons its too early for it to show up it appears that sometimes it has crossed over but is not giving the link while other times it is just not crossing over full stop with the nateby image i actually tried about N times just under half of those attempts seem to have crossed over 
 sorry but there is no page 
 if yes please support us here at 
 hi mbN i assume you are talking about 
 take care 
 im sorry i dont know of any material about the queen mother of the west my only contribution to the page was to complete a move request changing its title from pinyin to english and i did that because i was helping out with 
 hi i dont know if you realize it but you cant be contacted by the wikipedia email this user link this might be related to the email validation feature seems to me all admins should have a valid email address just thought id let you know 
 thanks i have validated my email address so it should work now 
 i didnt run and make a complaint i still dont know what you are talking about 
 you have created about N etnas now and you add one sentence and it is annoying if you create an article make it fairly large as a note you will recieve a warning 
 i am amused by the last N you did but too tired to make cogent or witty commentary good night and happy category cleaning up 
 hi gtbacchus im finishing some papers and i have taken the liberty of giving your name to 
 although i appreciate musical linguists kind intentions im not sure that i really appreciate her going around saying that i have been humiliated i have responded to that contention of musical linguist as for phaedriel i have no plans to say anything to her after and then and then 
 that is all 
 no you are not because you are me 
 wiki pokemon is now trying to replace 
 thanks for the headsup i have commented at the tfd 
 excuse me for troubling but in every case when i try use magnusmanske i get no results it means that i personally in no way can transfer any file from other wikipedias to commons so please help me transfer this file 
 http or or lvwikipediaorg or wiki or att per centcN per centN lsezere_riverjpg is already on commons http or or lvwikipediaorg or wiki or att per centcN per centN lsza per centcN per centN as_upes_d per centcN per centab per centcN per centbN is_pamp per centcN per centN per centcN per centbcosjpg has a custom template sedols which does not exist on commons commonshelper does not block you unless you are blocked on commons itself i suspect these are just the odd cases that dont work try if it works for you for other images 
 thats interesting but all cases when i try to transfer file from anywikipedia to commons i cant do it myself i dont believe that all cases are odd cases d odd cases d may be one two five but not absolutely all since last year it is impossible that absolutely all are odd cases d unless im blocked somewhere moreover other users collegues after my request very quickly can transfer it themselves thanks 
 hi there i thought that i should let you know that slimvirgin was not being at all accurate when she said to you that tim vickers posted a note on the village pump about conducting a straw poll to force the scholarly edit into wpv this is not how policy is made ever and these forest fire posts are extremely inappropriate and make it increasingly difficult to assume good faith i have dealt with this misrepresentation sorry to drag this onto your talk page but i didnt want you taking away a bad impression of me 
 my impression of you is only that you were inexperienced with policy editing tried to make a few edits and were surprised at the hornets nest that wp policy editing is im really not fussed about details like where you set up a straw poll and with what particular intention much more important is whether people are learning from this experience 
 or whatever i have declined your speedy because it isnt short and does provide context whether its encyclopaedic or not is another matter i can understand the basic premise but i cant understand the maths and the source given is worse if you come up with another category or a prod or afd i have no objection 
 oops looks like we nominated this for deletion at more or less the same moment technically yours went through first so i guess i will delete mine and add my reasoning to yours 
 unfortunately if i recall right the one that i nominated for deletion was just a picture gallery (i think you are referring to the 
 you have probably already seen this but 
 in my conversations with anarchocapitalism i have already suggested some more appropriate strategies for handling content disputes i agree that sock farms and sleeper accounts are a bad way to go about editing wikipedia and im not trying to unblock anybody whos going to use them my suggestion of unblocking anarchocapitalism is based on his agreeing to take a different approach assuming we decide that regulations is a separate person i think it would be fair to leave that account blocked until we get some kind of agreement to edit according to good wikipedia practices 
 as a side note anarchocapitalism related pages are 
 regarding the issue of a checkuser error or collateral damage i dont want to put words into 
 mastcell i dont want you to think im assuming good faith to the point of foolishness im looking carefully at the evidence and im not going to unblock the account if things dont add up right i actually had some dealings with rjii in the past and im certainly not trying to unblock that user the communication i have had with anarchocapitalism indicates that he has some willingness to change his approach but that has to be weighed against the evidence you are bringing up stay tuned we will figure something out i thank you for the effort you have put into gathering and presenting evidence its very helpful 
 no problem i do trust your judgement and i will stop bugging you now im sure im starting to sound like a broken record if you have any questions for me or concerns about what i have sent you feel free to leave a message or email me 
 ok i know i promised not to bug you anymore but two things i wanted to mention regarding the accuracy of initial checkuser which pegged anarchocapitalism regulations etc as billy ego socks and an anarchy or libertarianism regular whos interacted extensively with anarchocapitalism and friends 
 i apologize i feel like i have been a little quick to snip at you during the an debate on this topic i do feel pretty strongly about it as you have no doubt noticed but thats no excuse for giving you a hard time when you are trying to do the right thing apologies 
 thanks for dropping by to say that theres no hard feelings from my end 
 from what i understand hayter rewrote about half of the script and the other writers despite being entitled to credit declined for some reason also interestingly i found that whedon has talked about how one exchange he wrote did end up in the film i realize that this entire issue is a drop in the bucket 
 in short i for an anon user at 
 dukes comments on that talk page will probably never be seen by the anonymous editor in question that ip has only made two edits to wikipedia both N days ago and duke left a note today that anon is long gone and probably connected to a different ip address by now id let it lie 
 thanks for the opinion i will take no action as you suggest 
 in order to achieve absolute neutrality in everything especially the english language 
 hi did you seriously just intentionally undo N editors hard work that took place over the span of numerous hours with N of us actively collaborating together without so much as stopping to discuss it on the talk page where theres been various active conversations or was that accidental best 
 im sorry i may have gone too far there and i have instead reinstated the new version and made some changes i initially made the reversion because i was concerned about pov on an article for a living person failed had been added as a prefix all through the article rapture and judgment day were decapitalized for no apparent reason when they are supposed to be capitalized and a general negative tone about camping was now present in the article and mdash 
 moving here hope you dont mind easier for me not a problem i just restored the version sans pov stuff we hadnt gotten around to doing that after our conversations check that one out and let me know what you think as for failed its simply an accurate descriptor citable numerous places thats sadly not pov ( 
 i didnt miss your recent edits i removed the pov you inserted show me where is deep whatever voice is cited then show me how its relevant you also ended up losing the entire rework of the begat section which is now inaccurate as well as the clearer information in the bottom i lost no information in the revert and there was only one word left due to an improper understanding of npov that you were disputing best 
 again as we are working towards a consensus you should join us not simply pick your preferred version while such a process is in progress best 
 i suppose the deep voice part isnt entirely relevant to his notability but it describes his character which is relevant in any biography but i wont fight for its inclusion as for the clearer information on the bottom how was it clearer before if you want to revert me again go for it but i think there are some wordings and anticamping pov issues that need to be looked at and mdash 
 i dont see what you are talking about except that you obviously havent tried it i dont know what you mean by hackers backgrounds but linux is generally far more stable than windows as long as you make it work in the first place and both from companies that do it and forums which will help like i said your problem isnt that you cant use it its that you wont even give it a shot you are perfectly welcome to disprove that by actually trying it and telling me what is so difficult about it 
 interesting i said that it isnt difficult and that im going to try out some free oss both of your questions are based on either not reading not understanding or not believing what i said 
 im not sure who you are talking to i dont have any questions 
 sorry you are right those werent questions i was referring to your statements you wont even give it a shot and disprove that by trying it and telling me what is so difficult about it the first claim is simply false the second statement presupposes that i said installing a free os was difficult i did not additionally i never claimed that linux had no customer support which you seem to think i said i was talking about the weird version of windows that somebody installed on the computers at work 
 ah i see you meant to say that the loss of a comfort zone was installing a modified version of windows not trying linux simple miscommunication 
 yeah this thread continues from 
 who do you think 
 ah by hackers backgrounds i was referring to the background images put there by whoever put the windows installation together those are a liability of the new improved windows installation 
 yeah i thought you mean background as in a history as in either linux came from a bunch of hackers or it lead to people becoming hackers p how about in the future we use 
 i seriously need an admin who will be concentrated on bih related articles there has been on and off vandalism on the article republika srpska bosnians and serbians have reached a consensus but anonymous users still vandalize 
 consider 
 hello myasuda this message is to inform you that a thread at an or i has been filed concerning an issue in which you are involved the thread is cheers > 
 looks like the anon filer selfdestructed no need for me to get involved and mdash 
 thanks you for blocking 
 no problem 
 i assume you dont take offence but if you do let me know 
 of course i take offence its got to be nanodrschulz dont cut corners when it comes to 
 i have suggested another users comment may indicate antisemitism and am now being accused of libel for it i often respect your way of handling conflicts and wonder if youd provide an independent view but also go to 
 sorry i was away most of the weekend and only looked into it tonight i decided to sleep over it and now the thread has been closed my opinion is that the comparison of holocaust denial and cmt is inane one is a politically or hatred driven denial of firmly established reality the other is one end of a continuous spectrum not too far from the current mainstream the permanent hawking of that comparison is very counterproductive this is a clear example of 
 personally though i do think slrs comments were rather inappropriate in some circumstances i might have given a warning for them however ridiculous people are being i dont think a leading accusation of as is going to help matters and failing to treat the holocaust with sufficient reverence as an analogy is as likely due to ignorance as as meanwhile herrdrs old and set in his ways that he is needs to move on from 
 let me put it this way i agree that the accusation is not exactly in line with wikipedia policies (except for 
 getting a cheap thrill by using this page to vent a little of your antisemitism would be a pa even without the as reference but i will remember the iar argument for shocking someone to reflect on his behaviour ian paisleys white knuckle sermons on hell might be just the thing for someone who thinks hotdogs acceptable just because hamburgers are their compatriots 
 ian who and of course 
 noun>adjective might get you downgraded to N bozmo and while we are on grammar absolutely not acceptable meaning fine in dilution 
 agreed some editors not from australia seem to think that australian law schools are like graduate us style law schools eg high profile ones like 
 monash seems to have it but as an ex law student myself in a city that boasts four law schools none of which are remotely notable im honestly not getting why people think they are notable outside of the context of the universities within which they wholly operate 
 agreed i have already made the point on the deletion discussion law schools in australia are no more autonomous than engineering schools 
 hi im concerned about the extensive pov pushing and 
 i have a few times although i have been relatively uninvolved in these sorts of discussions for quite a while now 
 hi thanks for your message see and it seems that both lede and lead are okay right 
 no problem 
 hi gtbacchus in someone complained about my request for a N o saying that one had already been provided and accusing me of trying to garner increased involvement did you officially respond to my N o and simply forget to remove the request from the queue or did you offer the opinion outside of the N o structure thank you (also thank you for responding at the 
 oh dear i guess i supplied a third opinion without removing the request from the queue i didnt mean to cause any disruption or get you yelled at garnering increased involvement is a funny thing to be accused of because i generally think of that as a good thing if somebody doesnt like the N o listing then i guess a content rfc might be a better venue as well as a few relevant talk pages (not user talk pages per 
 article 
 i will have a look at the articles and let you know what i think its likely to be a day or two before i have time 
 thanks even i have to go through thoroughly me taking break 
 in short the policy quoted does not apply as one can clearly see from the distinctions made regarding onwiki harassment and the rejected proposal and secondly as an involved editor in the subject it is not your place
 go read 
 third party readers should note that this ip which has been previously warned for engaging against in inapropriate ways against identifiable living persons is editing his statement after it was responded to there is no reasonable argument being made that random stolen emails have lapsed into the public domain saying it dosent make it true 
 dont be an ass it was a clear edit conflict and where have i a blp violation
 are you denying you are the user referred to in 
 im denying blp violations
 are you denying you are the user referred to in 
 hi i had came across 
 thanks for dropping me a note i have been very busy and not logged on much lately but i have made some comments at 
 not every man wants for good you seem not to know the 
 a sadist considers enjoying the pain of others to be a good otherwise they wouldnt pursue it everyone pursues their understanding of the good plato made this clear i believe it was in the 
 you seem to know but im not much into formal philosophy to be frank i found so much work to be done in top level articles in wikipedia of N years old so much that i avoided community or admins and even edit summary wherever possible to save time 
 i have noticed you have done some edits on this article and seem perhaps familiar with the subject there have been some recent edits today and i cant figure out if they are vandalism or not it would be a big help if you could maybe take a look thanks 
 its hard to keep up with the anon ip edits on that article when its not protected some times there are accurate edits but more often its vandalism the deletion was a song that was released as an online video but not as a single so it was a valid deletion from the singles section 
 im sorry that this happened but it was to be expected as above if i can help in anyway please feel free to ask at my user page very best 
 i am also sorry it happened get more edits come back soon and try again not everone gets the mop on there first try 
 well i thank my supporters and now im going to take this criticism and use it to improve myself then try again sad to say i have a bigger problem on my hands last night at N am i made an article this morning it was gone im still waiting to find out why but anyway thats another topic all together i will just try to gain more edits then try again 
 what was the article called i can have a look for it if you wish 
 i may have lost the plot here but tph is quoting a very restrictive defn of uninvolved at 
 no you have lost the plot lar is right as you know 
 they were interesting answers indeed but i was referring to the question that starts out ah thanks for clarifying i think i see the source of the confusion ++ 
 sorry i missed that answered now 
 dont respond to bad stats anymore 
 that would probably be wiser but i cannot stand bad science or bad math thats what got me into the climate change arena in the first place i will try to restrain myself 
 i thought it had been proven that N per cent of all stats were inaccurate anyway 
 oh dont get me wrong challenge bad stats in article and article talk pages but at this point its just not worth it though i do admit that the N cabals per cell math is pretty funny 
 its not per cell its per molecule our cells are hopelessly overwhelmed by cabals but yes its probably time to call this off 
 i have taken a couple of pictures of a pine tree near where i work in 
 european black pine pinus nigra tips on photos top one is rather grainy and burnt out not easy to get a good pic with such a bright sky behind one of the menaces of getting good tree pics i fear 
 thank you very much 
 the only nation in asia that does publish good data about its units is the army of singapore i will do that one too in the next weeks also malaysia has much info available but its structure is nonexistent as it doesnt use brigades but the same kind of useless organization that the 
 ok take your time when your ready we will start with the detailed russian graph just send me whatever you have and i will do the graphs what about the above graphic it has all the info i found on wikipedia shuld i add it to 
 that link you just posted on another editors talk page purports to out them so posting that link in wikipedia probably isnt a very good idea you might need to request oversight to correct that edit 
 point taken thanks 
 yeah its still in the history so oversight is needed imo 
 i have requested it via email 
 stephan please remove your comment from the uninvolved section of the wmc rfe there is absolutely no argument to be made that you are uninvolved with respect to cc and especially not regarding wmc i intend to take this to arbcom if you do not selfrevert as your comment is inappropriate in that section 
 no its been there before with predictable apathy im uninvolved per the definition and im certainly more uninvolved that lar your comment on the other hand is completely inappropriate in that section 
 hi good work on juno one thing in the background section rommel had handed over to general 
 this is an update to my email asking for some time to get more sources in i dont know what your timetable is but going to fac any time after monday night should work fine for me i will have all my sources but one by then i have updated 
 hi dan im currently on holidays until the N th so im not going to fac any time before that i will probably put er up for fac before the beginning of august 
 fantastic for both of us have fun dank ( 
 cam jim sweeney has posted a photo on the talk page that he got from iwm i think i see the point it might help to give a visual answer to the oftenasked why didnt they move through the towns faster but i think knowing which images are going to survive a review is a skill i dont have what do you think dank ( 
 although i tend to sympathize and agree with you and wmc more often than not sv and atren have the facts on their side on this one it would be helpful if you could help resolve the problem and work with wmc to bring this to a conclusion i know that wmc has been harassed for years but when hes had this much mud flung at him for so long some is bound to stick wmc and others need to take a step back and look at the situation with fresh eyes im hopeful that you and others will be able to end this 
 this stuff has been going on for years albeit at a lower level im afraid it wont end until all scientifically literate editors have been driven off the climate change articles 
 all true but nothing is preventing any editors from admitting their mistakes learning from them and moving on 
 absolutely thats a point i have been trying to make to the science cabal keep your own conduct above reproach dont sink to the other fellows level its not just the right thing to do but also throws the misconduct of the wr or contrarian axis into sharper focus 
 sbhb was it necessary to take shots at lar and wikipedia review in your response here not that it should matter here but most of the participants at wikipedia review support the ipccs stance on humancaused climate change their criticisms of wmc are for different reasons the singer behavior in question being one of them if youd like to come to wr and discuss with the participants there i think they would be receptive to your input 
 i believe i shall decline your offer also if lar has not in fact referred to the science cabal i will gladly withdraw my statement with apologies but to the best of my recollection he has done so on numerous occasions 
 do you believe there is any truth to a statement that there is a science cabal involved with the agw articles 
 define cabal by commonly accepted definitions of the term such as given 
 thats not a productive line of inquiry science is the dominant pov for this encyclopedia whether some will choose to admit it or not and i realize that many will not claiming that there is a cabal of scientists or scienceminded editors is like saying there is a cabal of airbreathing waterdrinking primates unfortunately most people dont understand science and more importantly its methodology and if the science cabal is guilty of anything it is ignoring this fact and becoming impatient with the plebs so if you arent here to learn you have a responsibility to teach so what happens when the plebs refuse to learn here we are patience needs to come first and many simply dont have that capacity or have grown tired of answering the same questions over and over again 
 sv and atren have the facts on their side on this one i dont quite think so yes behavior on either side has not been perfect in the past of course the slate on the socalled skeptics side gets wiped clean over and over again when socks are discarded while mud on the side of consistent editors keeps accumulating but there is nothing in the current behavior that would justify a sanction 
 stephan surely you understand that even if wmc sprouts wings and a halo and starts playing a beautiful melody on the harp hes still going to be the target of an antiangel campaign to rid wikipedia of that pernicious angelbias wmc should probably not be engaging in any controversial or contentious edits for this reason ok so he enjoys the drama but seriously whats the shelf life of dramaloving editors 
 sure i agree with that too william is not always particularly wise in either his choice of fights or his methods but as much as i regret that thats a different topic he is grown up and he does respond to occasional prods by boris and me but again there is no merit in the current enforcement request 
 if they dont on purpuse assume their theory idea i think that we will have to change the name back ( 
 moving the other articles and templates doesnt sound like so much trouble of course they will need to move to follow the main article i will start working on that now 
 ok ask if you need help 
 i think they are all moved please let me know if there are any we missed that need admin buttons to move 
 hi gtbacchus i saw your comment on johann van beethoven and i thought we could use another neutral view over at 
 thanks alot for your comments mate i really appreciate it that you spared the time best wishes 
 its no problem thank you for engaging in a 
 what i did was constructive tell me how it wasnt constructive please 
 hmm on a second review of it may not have been vandalism but at the very least the nickname for michael richards containing a slang word was unsourced and unnecessary 
 politically correct jerk 
 mind the 
 thanks for fixing those it took me a while to realise what was wrong with them 
 you are welcome i remember being quite puzzled when i first came across similar situations 
 stephan what is your view of wmcs martian reverts do you believe they were good faith edits and if so please explain your reasoning 
 my opinions are sometimes available to pushy questioners at my normal consulting rate eur N per hour N minutes minimum ask for a quote to get an idea on the research cost or stick to 
 its not off topic and i see no comment in that other discussion on the merits of wmcs martian push in fact you evaded the question so i take it that this is a refusal to answer 
 you are a troll why not go somewhere else 
 because the cc articles are apparently where the trolls hang out 
 for those who need it i herewith officially declare this a noncc article 
 i have replied on to your comments on my talk page on my talk page for the sake of simplicity i would prefer to keep the entire discussion on my talk page instead of back and forward between mine and your talk pages 
 replied again 
 thanks for moving the article on 
 no problem happy editing 
 sv and atren have the facts on their side on this one baffling so v which of my recents edits do you regard as problematic and which serious enough to trigger the probation request do you regard it as unreasonable to describe singer as a retired physicst do you think it unreaonable to say that he is a gw skeptic 
 why dont you file an rfc on the talk page requesting a wide range of opinions could help your case do you understand that even though i dont personally agree with sv or atren they are using dr effectively and you are not svs enforcement request could be completely wrong but it could also be a convincing case you forget that whenever a single editor goes up against blp the policy is weighted towards the subject not the editor perhaps this is an oversight on your part 
 except that wmcs edit which was a basic interpretation of the sources is backed up by over N google books hits blp should never be used to disguise the facts 
 the argument that the first sentence on a blp should reflect the thing for which they have most coverage is a false one especially if it is a characterisation by third parties versus qualifications etc as in this case go and look at as i have already said at 
 polargeo i apologize if thats what you took away from my comments in order to understand something you need to be able to argue both sides if you cant do that then you dont really understand the topic now sv and atren have made a convincing argument on the enforcement page im not saying it is right and im not saying it is wrong but lets look at what wmc is arguing in his defense topic ban sv so we have got blp violation vs ban sv which of these arguments do you think is going to 
 im not interested in the procedure but the facts but i still find your sv and atren have the facts on their side on this one baffling if you meant have the politics on their side then id understand you by facts i thought you meant reality can you clarify what that phrase means to you 
 wrong on the ideal struucture of an article is fine this is sorted out through normal editing practices blp violation banned form editing blp articles is another level and is ridiculous sanctions are not there to sort out the fine structure of an article if i wished to write a balanced article for fred singer the prominant aspect of his life would indeed be his skepticism based on rs anyway 
 @viriditas this has become a witch hunt against wmc and i am not about to enforce anything 
 hi akhilleus i was just working on the backlog at 
 hi gtbacchus if you look at the logs of 
 thanks for explaining that i see now that i missed it because there arent any deleted edits there so i assumed it had not been deleted i also have no opinion on the pages existence i will look into the subjects notability and if it seems appropriate i will send it back to afd or just redelete it thanks again 
 i just reversed your move of this page please note that all similar page titles are in the singular and singular good is completely standard in economics 
 ok i have added a comment to 
 id like to ask for your input on a userbox issue i have encountered regarding the speedy deletion of several userfied userboxes that expressed negative stance toward a thing or concept i have held a discussion with the deleting admin in question and we have hit a dead point in the discussion as i know im biased in this issue id appreciate it if you could spare a neutral look at the dispute best wishes 
 got a link 
 woops sorry forgot ^^ its right on my 
 you forgot the tildes 
 i fixed the tildes thanks but i dont get the reference to 
 oops i meant 
 i see when i was in the uk i only ate rice from indian and chinese restaurants so i dont know the brands 
 consensus is definitely 
 if you feel that i should have asked another administrator about this i will its just that you were involved with this issue and i felt that you would be the best option to come to about this matter 
 no due to other additions to my talk page i actually didnt notice this section until now please give me a few hours to sleep and deal with this issue tomorrow im sorry for the delay and i thank you for your patience 
 i understand and thank you i should be getting to bed myself though for most people over here in 
 as i stated on the gabrielle solis talk page thank you 
 no problem 
 re thanks i must have been newted at the time 
 are you making up weird words on the go to confuse me anyways you are welcome 
 not quite 
 always glad to expand my vocabulary 
 does it not take just a bit more than someone saying they own it to remove a copyvio as can be seen i post from canada and whats to stop me claiming to be 
 as far as i understand it it is enough to stop a speedy it can still be sent to afd where the standards are a little different to stop a copyvio speedy though i think all you need is a claim of ownership much like you only need a claim of notablity to stop a nnbio speedy in both cases they may die in the afd process though where things are vetted a bit more if you find i am wrong straighten me out on this please 
 i didnt really know as i have never seen anyone claim ownership of a speed copyvio im tired and its almost quitting time N am and its N outside 
 stephan please dont do things like this you are only giving lar more ammunition 
 hey im only following his suggestions 
 thats rather a novel interpretation stop playing games place or move back a comment of yours in the uninvolved admin section or move one of mine out and there will be consequences ++ 
 i agree with sbhb but with respect to consequences im not fully clear as to why lar can rule stephan schulz is involved but stephan schulz cannot rule lar is involved could someone explain that to me it seems to me that both of them are right neither stephan schulz nor lar has the appearance of neutrality required to remain uninvolved 
 but lar has 
 i dont edit in the topic area and my constructive wikipedia contributions are somewhat shorter at only N or so years but other than that we are the same yes however editing in the topic area is what matters stephan schulz does edit there i do not further the other uninvolved admins find me uninvolved they do not find stephan schulz uninvolved ++ 
 lar your statement above is a statement of fact im not looking for you to justify your involvement or lack of involvement or stephan schulz involvement or lack of involvement im looking for you to explain how you are permitted to rule that stephan schulz is involved and how he is not permitted to rule that you are involved thanks 
 im uninvolved hes not the determination of this has been made so far by the uninvolved admins perhaps that will change i suppose i could ask arbcom for a ruling on it ++ 
 i think you should do that it appears that you have ruled hes involved and he has ruled that you are involved while my stance is that he is obviously involved and you are probably involved i dont see how one can argue that your ruling is valid and his is not absent a ruling from someone with the authority to state that one of you is right or wrong it would appear that you are both dqed alternatively you could all stop mucking around with your stupid magic discussion section and instead try to resolve the problem but thats not the goal here is it 
 its been mine all along some dont like that hence their machinations id say it looks like one team trying to remove a ref they dont like because hes too impartial for their taste ++ 
 best all the same 
 thanks for dropping by i replied to that one post at npa in the interest of not breaking up the train of thought if my reply seems inappropriate there or if it seems desirable to develop that angle any further you are certainly welcome to be refactor it to this page im quite happy for the conversation to move to 
 it is possible that my temper is affected having smoked my last cigarette on saturday night last after N years on and off smoking but those two editors were mocking me and slapping each other on the back about it jerking each other off figuratively describes what they were doing quite accurately uncivil crass perhaps violent no 
 what kind of hair is this to split is it really the point whether your incivility was a N or a N on a scale of N to dick i consider blatantly disrespectful statements to be an act of violence against the dignity and decorum that we try to maintain going off on someone like that is aggressive and in a way violent slander is also a form of violence against someones good name however this is so far from being the point i feel silly talking about it the point is whether or not you are treating others excellently if you wish to quibble then i will cheerfully retract the word violent even though i dont really think that throwing accusations and insults around is less unacceptable than throwing fists around but lets take it away perhaps my view is offkilter or just wrong there remains the fact that your reaction to being called out for incivility is to argue with the criticism rather than trying to set anything right am i supposed to be impressed by that if you have an issue with what those two were saying why not present it as a rational constructive criticism rather than as accusations with vulgarities attached even better why not address the actual points being made and show by example what its like to have a mature discussion im not saying their banter was helpful or productive but your reaction to it seems particularly inappropriate the best reaction to immature behavior is to rise above it 
 i dont think that i have disputed that i was uncivil with those two are they deserving of an apology probably about as much as i am deserving of one from them but since no one seems to be crawling up their asses about their behavior my expectations for apologies all around are pretty low if you expect an act of contrition from me toward them im sorry but its not likely to happen if someone asks me if i still beat my wife im not going to decrypt and psychoanalyze them and then address their points i find it interesting that miltopia got all handwringy and bent out of shape about comments that were not even directed at him considering his overall history im guessing my comments hit a little too close to home with him so he assumed that i was attacking him if i was a chronic abuser of 
 ok keep arguing then you are right to reply to immaturity with immaturity if two wrongs dont make a right then maybe seven or eight will i was happy enough just to say hey lets not make comments like that but you want to go seven rounds over it fine you win enjoy it 
 you could have blocked all these guys for engaging in the revert war in the first place gt then incivil talk page postings would not have been a problem you are too kind it seems best regardsuN 
 thanks for your input i will take that under advisement maybe i will start throwing my weight around and acting like more of an asshole heavyhandedness is so much better than diplomacy i have not observed that more blocking leads to less talk page incivility but im sure you are right thanks 
 well you never know until you try it seems to work for some people uN 
 yeah im going to stick with my usual position of trying to convince everyone to treat each other excellently to choose peace over retaliation and to stop assuming that other people are some kind of scum or idiots just because they disagree with someone its a dirty job but someones gotta do it 
 look dont write those rightups if your english is so bad or if you cant be bothered properly reviewing them before hitting the button sorry to be blunt but it was very sloppyuN embarrassingly souN and remains embarrassing since your friend taxman has blundered in and reverted my inline queries without dealing with them im not going to babysit what you write i have pointed out the problems and you are quite satisfied in leaving the crap in there for all to read its such a bad advertisement for you and for the project 
 i can see how the first sentence is clumsy and overseas is unforgivable but i stand by the rest 
 no the rest was wanting whether its fit for purpose the context the relevance whether theres an alternative view was pretty bad and discredits that organisation through its illiterate use of the language the past tense as i said was wronguN it indicated that wp no longer reflects notions of the global village you had quoted it partially in a way that rendered it false see now 
 criticisms are fine you just need to learn how to do it in a more constructive and civil manner 
 i thought your edit summary was far from civil 
 rightups 
 well spotted 
 sorry for the delay in replying i have been busy in real life the article as deleted read like a promotion looking at the tone and the lack of emphasis on what it is as opposed to why it is great the three links to your blog didnt help either if you believe that this is a legitimate concept that deserves a place on wikipedia i encourage you to rewrite it focusing on especially on these issues verification (
 sorry to break the news to you but 
 looks like someone has deleted it now 
 only if you are right that you are impartial if you are wrong its a biased ref trying to call games for their team you will need to find a way to resolve that dispute instead of just running into a brick wall over and over you suggested arbcom that would work you and stephen could also agree to one arbitor of fact submit all the evidence to them and agree with whatever their ruling was about involvement both one or neither of you being unequivocally ruled involved to just keep reverting away at eachother is disruptive in fact given this section if either of you posts in the uninvolved admin section again i will go to arbcom there problem solved 
 get your request ready then the other uninvolved admins find me uninvolved and have said so repeatedly that should do for you i have no plans to stop participating as an uninvolved admin you cant take me out of the game with this ploy ++ 
 you seem to have misunderstood me im not trying to take you out of the game or whatever 
 no you have misunderstood me im uninvolved the other uninvolved admins agree you need to get over it dont interfere with the working of the board because that is disruption but this probably belongs on my talk as i came here to warn stephan not debate you ++ 
 can you please reinstate 
 done 
 have you been treating me excellently and not assuming that i am some sort of wiki scum was i edit warring on the npa policy page i was not aware that making a single edit constituted edit warring as soon as i started discussing my edit in talk i had my good faith questioned immediatelyh by multiple editors after my less than civil comment on the talk page i immediately went into the next section and began participating as i usually do in a reasoned and civil manner i am only responding to you repeatedly here because you seem to be interested in making me out to be a chronic abusive editor and expect some sort of contrite acknowledgment similar to the krimpet or mongo situation yesterday i suggest you examine my contribution history and my block log in full before you make such assumptions about me having your admin bit turned on does not automatically imbibe you with great wisdom nor does it entitle you to be genuflected before so i had a bad day big friggin deal 
 i sure as hell havent assumed that you are any kind of scum ever i dont think there exist people who are anything other than children of god with all that such a position entails did i accuse you of edit warring no did i accuse you of being chronically uncivil no do i believe that you are an edit warrior or a chronically uncivil editor no dont you dare tell me what kind of assumptions i have made about you you have no idea what i assume what i saw was you responding to one isolated situation in a way that was rude and out of proportion on a page that really needs deescalation and not escalation i left a very politely worded warning on your talk page and i said on the page in question can we please not make comments like that rather than simply saying yeah that was out of line you chose to cavil over it that pushed a button on me it turns out because i being human have got buttons somehow between the two of us we managed to keep escalating and i ended up being a dick im sorry i screwed up as far as i know that one incident was the only time you have ever been uncivil with anyone i dont think you reacted well to my initial comments and i didnt react well to your reaction we are both human i will endeavor to learn from this experience so i thank you for the lesson 
 i left you a reply on my talk page i think we understand each other moving on 
 i have filed this case to get clarity on the involved or not involved status of both of you you may respond there 
 thanks done 
 and hny from me 
 seasons greetings and a happy new year cheers 
 generally one of the more considered voices fwiw 
 thanks partly at least 
 you are a math teacher right may i ask what grade level 
 i dunno thats kind of a personal question i teach at a little private school we work with different ages my youngest student is a seventh grader doing prealgebra and i have got a handful on seniors learning calculus i used to teach at university 
 you accidentally erased sarekofvulans view when you added yours 
 thanks for catching that fixed 
 any chance you could move the clean rewrite at 
 done 
 thanks 
 im really not trying to push your buttons here with my last edit but its like we are from different universes oh and have you ever tried 
 and by the way wikipedia is the encyclopedia any one can edit i have no problem with such agents 
 you noted that the list of involved persons is still very incomplete at the above request what were the usernames you had in mind 
 certainly 
 any others you can see that have been missed 
 also more pertinently im not sure encouraging this sort of thing is a good idea there are editors who would genuinely suffer if they are editing were traced back to them im aware of at least one person who edited here for a while who could have been in serious trouble if the government of the country he was in found out about it in general theres not much need to give in to demands for combining anonymity for the el issue when they are almost completely orthogonal matters and speaking from experience once you give up anonymity you never ever get it back 
 joshua thanks for your advice however i gave up my anonymity long ago i posted my name in our facebook quite a while back and for quite some time my user page linked back to my old userpage at 
 your edits were foolhardy it wont be long till thats up on the attack sites you should ask for oversight on those going through the harrassments no fun my point was that people like privatemusings want attack site links left in but hes not willing to go public now is he if you are not already outed or willing to do it you shouldnt be arguing for outing sites im impressed you are willing to but you will be regretting it soon those folks watch this stuff like hawks and the police wont care until its way past bad go ask for oversight on those edits 
 thuranx im not worried about those attack sites listing me what if they post my name and 
 you argue that any restriction on what sites can be linked via wikipedia is objectionable regardless of the reasoning as for me blocking others thats a total bullshit argument as you know full well im not an admin and thus cant block and i never will be an admin i object to crass promotion of outing and attack sites and their linking through wikipedia you object to my entire point of view to accuse me of supporting outing sites because i support blocking them thats total doublespeak you can try that all you want but up is up not down i continue to object to outing and linking to outing sites you continue to object to any banned sites who supports outing sites and who doesnt reconsider your perspective as for your selfouting i really do hope you dont get the blacklash i expect you will from it i went through it and it sucks thats why your position is completely incomprehensible supporting the linking to outing sites while claiming you hate outing sites is hypocrisy and doublespeak 
 not to butt in but as i understand gtbacchuss origional point of view he objected to some earlier versions of the proposal on the basis that they opened a huge can of 
 more irrelevant doublespeak and the arbcom sees it my way 
 well you are the one going around saying joshz supports brandt so i kind of doubt thatuN 
 you guys are welcome to take this elsewhere 
 thuranx you may wish to learn about 
 blah blah blah policy blah blah blah npa blah blah blah we all know what you think of policy 
 thuranx keep digging you clearly know a whole lot about joshuaz yeah the more you talk the less you annoy me and the more you amuse me 
 thuranx might you not have perspective on gtbacchus selfouting here i mean do you really expect him to return and panic rushing off to oversight and screaming what have i done or were your comments directed at someone else maybe i just missed the sarcasm anyway i dont think there are attack sites that target tony gtbacchus so you probably need not worry for his sake 
 might i ask why you initiated 
 it was an obvious case impersonating another user and an or i has the quickest response times for obvious admin tasks 
 not N im and aiv thing is there is now a blocked vandal with no sockmaster noted what with the recent debate regarding sock tagging might this action be unfortunately misrepresented as a way of bypassing the need to determine whose sock it is before the banhammer is swung 
 what is N im i dont think i have ever used aiv it was clear disruption using a name that suggest being a sock of wmc using some wmcisms you can still run an spi if you want we have had scibabys checkusered after the block too 
 is the first and only vandal warning another dubious edit and zap well a report to aiv anyway aiv is easier to use than cc enforcement requests and a damn sight faster too the other point being well if it is likely scibaby why not add it to the enforcement page listing 
 there is no good evidence that he is scibaby although thats an interesting possibility but that would be a new moo for him 
 see 
 you were mentioned on same toward the bottom seems to be regarding this diff i just got up after a very late flight and an unplanned N hour drive home and am not sure what its all about just thought you might want to know ++ 
 i saw it it may be that tfd saw my comments and was inspired by them google finds N hits for quote marks including in grammar guides and our own 
 and the total time differential between the oposts allowed him to copy the exact sentence remarkable coincidence at that point especially considering and the fact that the sentence as such finds zero google hits zero none nil truly remarkable that this sentence never used before on the internet gets used twice in a matter of a very few minutes 
 i dont see collects evidence as an accusation directed stephan but rather a point about the unreliability of behavioral evidence 
 precisely has stephan seen this from a person he knows is a sock it would be given as conclusive proof i fear 
 show one single instance where i did that please either of you back to the original point as i wrote above a plausible explanation is that tfd wrote his original comment went to collects user page saw the discussion thought yeah that bugs me too and used the modern wonder of copy and paste to insert it into his comment i dont know if thats the case but it is dangerous to assume coincidence when there might be a causal pattern the other problem is of course only looking for abnormalities going over all the texts written by involved editors there will be certain overlaps by random chance if you dig for them of course you will find some 
 and if you saw the same N word sentence written by a person you knew to be a sock would you have used it as evidence consider the proximity of these edits and the fact that nowhere else on the internet has that precise wording been used seems a bit strong as evidence to you i suspect two editors posting to the same person using the same words within a matter of minutes 
 why dont you go and find out if i did my edits are 
 new user with disruptive edits as proof that it is a sock at the usual is accepted per your use of the usual at and one more at another one given as evidence at no deviation given as evidence at the third is different but the same which is rather an unusual type of evidence at typical moo at here we go again at not to mention all the ones you added without any comment other than the edit summary of next want more and you did use the usual contrary to your denaial not to mention listing folks with only next as evidence 
 so in no case you found did i use a similarity of phrasing as evidence and im not aware that i ever denied using the usual as evidence in general in fact i have explicitly defended it as adequate for opening an spi case in cases where the sock is wellknown and obvious 
 and your standard allows for N per cent acuracy as sufficient to meet obvious seems you would have hanged van der sloot faster than nancy grace my standard of obvious is a tad more rigourous than yours it would appear 
 first have you computed my quota but secondly yes sure i consider a likelihood of N per cent sufficient for starting an investigation wouldnt you expect police to open a murder investigation if they are N per cent certain in particular if they have two indepdendent suspects which are equally compromised does that mean they should do nothing after all the chance that any one of the suspects did it is at most N per cent 
 standards for an indictment are in fact higher than N per cent and police investigate the murder they are not supposed to investigate a single person with the goal of convicting that single person of something and definitely not using as evidence the usual 
 yes i agree with the principle that you or the usual would have convicted a skeptical editor based on similar evidence the nice thing about having collected so many scibaby convictions is that the ip ranges from isps of the falsely convicted will be tagged as scibaby which makes it easier and easier to ban new editors you dont feel should be editing 
 i assume you talk to lar 
 yes of course but why do you ask has he articulated thoughts similar to the ones you just responded to or is this simply a diversionary tactic on your part 
 sorry for being imprecise i assume your comment was addressed to lar since its indented accordingly and assuming its addressed to me its a completely nonsensical failure of 
 ah then you should have asked who the post was addressed to not who i talk to since i talk to a great number of people i admit that the indent was imprecise but i thought it was pretty clear that i was addressing you and didnt think anyone would really notice the indent since the original post was up there quite a ways also i dont know why you think thats an assumption of bad faith rather than an observation of how the whole scibaby crisis hasnt gone to waste 
 im not sure badgering stephan is a good approach a sockpuppet investigation is not like a murder investigation and the standards of evidence are much lower ++ 
 just not sure no condemantaion of your travelling support network then 
 let me see atren the good locust and collect all turn up and lar paternally says im not sure about this badgering tell it like it is lar you are intelligent you know the score these folks are way over the top but they stick by you unquestioningly where on the other hand you condem a load of editors who are willing to oppose each other when they disagree who is the real cabal clique claque 
 interesting claim but since i disagree with lar over N per cent of the time and overlap on a grand total of two articles any claim about being part of his group becomes a bit ludicrous unless 
 the usual collect self selected nonsense statistics i hope you realise this is the sort of crap that really annoys people about your editing 
 polargeo that appears to be a personal attack what people are you referring to 
 is this a poll of editors annoyed by collects editing style if so please include me on the list as one of the people 
 nope and stephan schulz is not ikip either i suggest you read the discussions about socks at rfar currently thanks 
 i am refering to collect and his usual statistical nonsense pa is not designed to be applied at this level and i rather hope that you realise this and dont try to wikilawyer with me 
 polargeo im not sure you are being very helpful here either it may be a better approach to try being a bit less blustery better could we all just take the point that small sample phrase correlation isnt always accurate and drop this ++ 
 come on lar you cannot be truly impressed by the statistical nonsense collect keeps coming up with please just tell him to stop this 
 unless i am much mistaken im not sure you are at all clear on what point collect is actually trying to make here it has little or nothing to do with statistics and your repeated reference to stats suggests you have failed to grasp that but as i said i think the point has already been made more than adequately and at this point nothing useful is being added at least not directly useful anyway although lots of interesting diffs are being generated so i suggest it be dropped and everyone move on ++ 
 yes another mildly hidden lar threat against me statistics well collect said N per cent presenting his usual statistics you cannot really pick me up on pointing to the obvious 
 hi about 
 i have restored the material to 
 dont worry about it you can apply again in a few months good luck mate 
 thanks your optimism is appreciated uN 
 okay so if you want to upload a picture of a real person the license says something about comferming the picture how do you not get the picture deleted every time i do that it gets deleted in about a week or so 
 i really dont know much about uploading pictures but i can try to find the answer to your question i probably wont get to it tonight though because im about to go out 
 i have completed its 
 i have made an admittedly grudging concession at 
 you didnt assume good faith you assumed i was on a mass link deletion spree 
 hello gtbacchus i noticed you closed the move proposal at 
 i feel that my job in closing moves is to read consensus that includes taking into account comments made in that particular discussion as well as largerscale consensus for established guidelines such as 
 anyway nice essay and i hope it sticks 
 hi i only just now noticed this section sometimes the talk page gets away from me thank you for reading my essay and for the link to yours i think what you have written is very true and that you have articulated the idea well have you thought of advertising it at the 
 after your unusual question about my drinking habits i was curious about articles you had edited i looked at 
 btw your own karma might not be quite so great when you look at the possible sockpuppet reincarnation of miltopia the permabanned megatroll 
 who said hes anonymous to me what do you know about what i know have a nice day good work again on phxeN dre 
 hi i have been very impressed with some of your recent contributions and therefore you a token of my appreciation your contributions have been some of the very few good things to come out of this whole silly affair best wishes 
 thank you thats very kind it gets a bit stressful in there and its not that pretty at all i think that we are learning as a community and i hope that im at least pushing in some of the right directions i guess we hope that if enough people are pushing with good faith then we will all average out to some kind of slow progress in the right direction take care 
 hi gtbacchus could i get your opinion on a case of potential sockpuppetry i suspect a newly registered user to have operated under closely matching ips before and after using a previous account several other editors seem to agree with this suspicion and now i am trying to figure out which further steps (ie filing a report at 
 hmm it appears that it may be the same person however as 
 it does as you can surely see from the wpani discussion this whole affair has been a little more than just a bit frustrating so far but knowing that you will be around to keep an eye on things certainly takes some of the edge off thanks 
 cyrus im a bit busy and cant watch the page as actively as i might otherwise please do let me know if a situation arises while im looking elsewhere and i will be sure to drop by and comment thanks 
 okay will do as you might have noticed there was another brief edit war over the 
 first of all i dont know anything about 
 he often vandalizeses an article called 
 i have also reported him 
 im not so sure that this separate page is warranted have you considered the possibility that he may be right to remove this link at any rate i have added two cleanup tags to 
 actually i have tagged it as a possible copyvio as the text was copied and pasted from that contains no licensing information therefore we have to assume it is copyrighted unless evidence to the contrary is presented 
 sorry i have not kept track very much of course to each of these you need to add their socks (eg 
 add each of them to suspected sockpuppets of scibaby i really think you are going out of your way to prove my earlier point about the scibaby menace the bigger the better otherwise i dont see any logical justification for adding some of those to such a category especially ratel except for inflating the number of communists scibaby socks 
 sorry clarified by adding eg above your parser seems to be broken on both the grammatical and the common sense level though 
 i blame it on the drugs 
 none of these are scibaby socks as far as i know but there are another dozen or so sockmasters who have turned up at gw to run cus against when cheesy feet show up short of going through the entire list of socks and finding familiar names i am not sure how to list them was just trying to work out which joker 
 i have a pretty good idea who the joker is 
 agreed sometimes a cigar is a just a cigar i suggest this investigation immediately begin with those who have consistently demonstrated a flagrant disregard for wikipedias rules and policies since such disregard for rules would be consistent with sockpuppetry im glad we see eye to eye on this boris 
 i was thinking more about the common pattern of people who think they are much funnier than they actually are and have a tendency to irony and sarcasm 
 unfortunately i cant be too funny on wikipedia id have been banned long ago if that was the case due to the overreactionary tendencies and bad faith assumptions around here cheers 
 you do not own the article (see 
 you are acting as if there is some sort of obligation that you must agree before the article is redirected that is implying that you 
 as i said it can help to contact people but there is no obligation at all to do anything just because you missed out does not mean that we need to go back to the way it was you can now discuss on the series article if you would like to bring it back 
 i noticed you have been involved in discussion with 
 yes he seems to have some peculiar ideas about what project we should be pursuing here eventually he will either decide to be a part of this project or he will leave i suppose i dont think wikipedia is going to start including original research just because some people would like for it to at that point what would distinguish wikipedia from the rest of the internet thats what id like to know 
 there is a huge difference between actually misleading someone into an incorrect direction for scienfic research and providing synthesis material for a videogame article at some point wikipedia actually ends up censoring geniunely helpful information which is exactly where it is at now 
 he has almost no mainspace edits they all seem to be in talk pages and project talk pages given this i dont think he will actually step outside the playing field hes drawn and simply adopting a 
 that sounds good please let me know if i can be of assistance 
 i thought it would be polite to let you know that i referred to your when not to call a spade a spade essay in discussion at 
 the shortcut 
 hi sorry i didnt notice the survey i came there from anis where was or is a case about the user erasing diacritics i suspected it as one of that case so i moved it in good faith back to the version with diacritics 
 reasonable enough i removed it 
 there are tons of banners and i have no idea why there is not this one it must have some reason but what reason who knows 
 rude hah i will have to reply more thoroughly tomorrow but i will say for now that you can crash my page anytime you like whatever that ends up meaning 
 re are you sure as i said if you look in the history the banned tag is added by an anon with the comment redundant and more or less community banned 
 its a serial sockpuppeteer for whom the banning policy has been applied for years as well as someone who will not be unblocked by any administrator without a community discussion first i think its safe to call it a de facto ban 
 im not sure i really care about the details and this may be angels dancing on pinheads but this user has been blocked indefinitely because checkuser confirms that he or she has abusively used one or more accounts seems quite adequate and also accurate the banned template is ambiguous and has no clear source other than an anon edit but the trouble is the template produces this user is 
 your concern id say hes pretty well communitybanned per the old blocked forever policy 
 regarding could you please provide me with a link to the 
 why dont you just propose whatever you are going to propose and see if anyone bites rules are not legalistic formulations obviously you are going to propose an unblock for scibaby so just do it and be done his status as blocked where no one will unblock or banned is irrelevent 
 by long convention indefinite block + no admin willing to unblock + some amount of time elapsed banned by that metric scibaby is clearly banned but in general i agree with hipocrite in that its not really worth arguing about legalistic discussions about block vs ban usually dont go anywhere meaningful and im completely unable to see how a legalistic resolution of that distinction will extricate wikipedia from dealing with scibaby 
 thank you very much for your edits to the article 
 you are welcome i am wondering if some of the info is necessary like the long description of the writers experience in the movie theater which dont seem quite the same as the simpson plot regards and mdash 
 hmm i guess you are right about that i will try to shorten it down are there any other information that seem unnecessary 
 i will let you know if there are i just removed a sentence cartwright said the character designers had fun designing the musicians in the episode as it didnt say anything specific about how or what they enjoyed regards and mdash 
 ok thanks 
 stephan this is not helpful please follow your own wise advice and consider selfreverting 
 but man its hard seriously i cannot make out half of what he says is it me 
 pardon me and honest assessment with this may help you to better comprehend 
 that is truly beautiful the question is do we define that it is 
 then explain your edit on my talk page quickly because i need to go offline very soon and i will be away for hours 
 spelling my name seems to be a running joke on wikipedia 
 no thats not it at all explanation on my talk page correction made at an or i gotta go 
 sorry should have added a there i dont mind terribly much 
 why does this particular page need to exist why can this content not be included in 
 just to let you know i handed both cladeal and the ip a N hour block for gaming an edit war on 
 im not ignoring this issue but im rather busy offwiki at the moment i promise to have a look at this as soon as i can im sorry for the delay 
 hi gt i didnt think you were in fact thank you for handling it so far as golbez has said the ip and cladeal are blocked i might ask you about help or something at an rfc if the issue comes up again 
 oh im never quite sure how quickly time moves on the wiki fits and starts you know one thing does occur to me you mention 
 sounds like an idea if that does fail though i will come back here and ask about rfc and how to proceed if that is alright 
 it absolutely is happy editing 
 but then again we all have to follow the rules even when they are inconvenient 
 um no see 
 well i dont think limiting oneself to single sentence questions is comparable to exterminating a race but i suppose i get your point im more of an inclusionist myself and think you should be able to write it however you want and if they dont want to read it then thats fine cheers 
 tgl that is so bang out of order it stuns me redact it now and you had better fucking mean it when you apologise jesus christ man what the hell is wrong with you 
 mark if you are joking add a if not i dont think tgl said what you think he did i certainly dont feel attacked by this comment 
 i think he thought i was making a jab at your initials but i could be wrong additionally i tend to use strong words or phrases like exterminate which sometimes draw forth emotional reactions even when used innocently 
 careful there is it really wise for a locust to use words like exterminate 
 well is it really wise for a doctor to use words like exterminate 
 ok now im totally lost 
 you must read the 
 you misspelled civilized hth 
 ouh mythis is gounna be a loung jouurney 
 a little disappointed with your comments directed at me at 
 im sorry that you are disappointed i would point out that i apply very different standards to article space and to user space i think our goal in article space is neutrality no matter what people may think of it i would never base articlespace decisions on what is likely to offend people on other pages however we are presenting the human face of wikipedia and i would be disappointed if our human face is one with the attitude i dont care whether i offend you or not onwiki for me is not one homogeneous place the article pages are the encyclopedia and the other pages are backstage and i make very different edits in one space than i would in the other i have been to london plenty of times i think i would count it as my favorite city in the world and its very very different from the third world when i used to flee from kenya to england and regain my sense of equilibrium it was very clear to me which place was part of my world and which one was not 
 gtbacchus id like to pop in and say thank you for the contribution on ani as you expressed my concerns better than i did i was trying not to catch neil in the crossfire but give those who as i saw it made an argument for an uncaring place something to consider 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or and for all the wonderful things that you have done your dedication to mexican titleholders and pageants in general is really appreciated keep up the good work 
 if you have any questions about the permission dont hesitate to ask otherwise happy editing 
 in the interest of good form you should know i stuck my beak in your beeswax over 
 i swear didnt we just have 
 ps given that everything in wikipedia is visible to everyone probably hundreds of people will become aware of something that perhaps i dont really want to publicize so be it that might have the side effect of spreading more awareness about civility 
 i like your essay on persuasion thats a useful angle to take on the issue have you seen 
 i will read nospade thats one i hadnt heard of maybe i will read through the whole category of essays and someday i hope to finish my own essay on persuasion 
 hi everyone forgive my extremely long absence i recently took an extended vacation in tuN dkyuN d japan what disasters have occurred while i was gone for give my pessimism but everything else im involved with seemed to unravel while i was in japan 
 oh and also does anyone know how to archive im starting to get too many messages here thanks 
 and i do you should create a stephan schulz spelling template and then template the editors who get your name wrong you might combine this with a stephanschulzspellingbot to automatically search for misspellings of stephan schulz i think this would save much time and effort and contribute to a more efficient encyclopedia 
 nice idea but at the moment im still planning the great climate science analysis bot and before i even start that there is the 
 too late 
 you moved all the page from rodimus to hot rod but the transformers energon rodimus has never been known as hot rod and just that portion of the page should be moved back to rodimus let me know what you think 
 i would say you are entirely welcome to split off the part of the article about energon rodimus i was just moving the transformer formerly known as hot rod to the appropriate title 
 well i suppose im not really supposed to be hanging in wikipedia and have fun hopefully i will have more time after i got my phd 
 a request for arbitration involving you has been filed 
 on another note good luck talking guy around you and i seem to share the the same opinions on that matter and you seem to be very patient so good luck 
 thanks for removing me as a party i will be watching the request with interest and the case if it is accepted take care 
 how interesting that we now find out that the other skeptic friendly administrator also had a secret opinion on the content all along 
 you werent surprised at this surely 
 by an administrator advancing a content position through the use of tools no not at all isnt that why people become administrators 
 i did it for the groupies its been a bit disappointing so far 
 hi gt regarding your recent 
 huh i guess im kind of oldschool when it comes to such things thanks for the update 
 to whom are you referring hipicrite who has a secret opinion 
 really based on what maybe we should 
 hey man long time no see thanks for taking care of that 
 irrelevant side note we share the same last name or 
 does your family come from 
 thanks for the reply i would suggest that if its easily fixed in code or if a little more code gives the template more flexability to editors it is probably a worthwhile change i wasnt sure if a subst would affect anything about how the page is referenced in the rm process i know your talk page isnt exactly the place but i figured youd be a good sounding board before hitting template talk im not aware of any family from oklahoma my fathers side of the family werent much for geneaology or record keeping so im unaware where anyone futher up the ancestorial chain were from i grew up in the deep south or 
 if you know how to add that functionality to the template and document it then id say go for it substing is an inelegant solution so if theres an easy technical fix i see no reason not to do it 
 um i think you may be looking for 
 does it help to look through 
 stephan please reread my questions on hipocrites page and explain to me how its a witch hunt those questions were polite and reasonable in fact much more reasonable than hipocrites own questioning of others on sock puppetry he has admitted having socks and having disclosed them so my request for clarification was completely within bounds please retract 
 nope especially because he has admitted to previous socking its none of your business unless you have evidence of current abuse assume good faith now that you have the information what will you do with it 
 yes it is my business because he has said he disclosed them but i found no disclosure i am doing research for the current cc case and the knowledge of an involved editors disclosed socks is relevant to that it was a simple question that he responded to with hostility and you and guettarda piled on with baseless accusations ironically this kind of hostility and piling on is the root problem in this topic area and is the kind of thing that will be central to my evidence 
 sorry are you alledging that you did work to find disclosure what did you do exactly 
 i searched your user page your talk page and your recent history i didnt find anything so i asked 
 and the knowledge of an involved editors disclosed socks is relevant to that how 
 so that i can research the contribution histories of those socks to see if there is anything related to my evidence remind me again why was this inapproprate he admitted using socks and disclosure of those socks i just asked for his disclosure there is nothing wrong with that 
 damn it i should have remembered that was there sorry 
 scarian no worries nav take it to the cof page uN 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or this is for being continually cool no matter how hot wiki gets the term cool under fire seems to be made for someone like you now if i had any artistic skillz i should make a bs to fit purely that hmm meh until that day comes if ever this is deserving of you and vice versa jump slash dash ouch super 
 thank you very much 
 thanks for fixing that and for your opinion on wpships i really should have hit the preview before hitting submit 
 no worries i think my last opinion on wpships was a while ago though or do you mean 
 my mistake i thought you posted on wpships and not the 
 are you able to collaborate with me on articles again now 
 i might have some time over this weekend to work on the production section for 
 how about a finding that too many findings of evidence are suggested with no evidence nor is any forthcoming when asked for 
 it has a nice metaring to to so it appeals but i dont see what difference it would make if accepted so its probably not worth it 
 sock puppet cases tend to move slowly until an admin makes a decision i have lost interest in this case so i will refer you to three of the admins who have closed cases recently and maybe one of them can help you these are 
 thanks im in no hurry its not an easy case for sure cheers 
 well there is no name to the byline which an article in a newspaper usually has oped or editorials not so much do you not think you should have gone to talk before reverting btw 
 on the contrary editorials usually do have named authors news articles do not neither is a hard and fast rule though editorials contain opinions and commentary not reporting and editorials are not usually posted under home > features > science > article no since its a clear case 
 generally speaking 
 ok guys thanks as you know i have to be extra careful with regards to blp`s 
 actually you have to be extra careful with evaluating sources 
 actually i have to be extra careful about everything cheers 
 i think you can safely go to the pub and have a pint there i will be in edinburgh from july N th to N th i will be fairly busy but if you are close enough we can have one on me in the peach or some other pub 
 that`s a real nice offer and if it were not for the N hour drive i`d take you up on it but driving that far for one pint would be a killer 
 id make it two pints but i get your point perhaps some other time 
 if ever your near 
 thanks for the close on 
 i believe they are all taken care of now thanks 
 thanks for fixing my typo i dont quite understand how this error occured by the way are you standing over my shoulder watching everything i do id better put some clothes on i quess 
 about the error most likely it was a database thing 
 can you handle this ip or should i take it to 
 scratch that looks like jf got it already thanks for looking out or 
 i have added your name to involved parties in the arbitration case 
 ok 
 you seem to be referring to edit of mine the paragraph i removed seemed to be mostly original research and it was written in the style of a moral instruction book rather than an encyclopedia it was rambling and addressed the reader in the second person by the end of the paragraph it certainly wasnt aquinas ideas being presented so its unclear where aquinas stops and the writers interpretation starts overall i didnt think it improved the article if you disagree you are welcome to reinsert it it would be a good idea if you do that to comment on the talk page explaining why you put the sentence back 
 hello can i cambiare my username where 
 xcN una cosa molto difficile da fare il pixfN semplice sarebbe di creare un nuovo utente allora indica il vostro vecchio nome alla parte superiore di esso questo modo nessuno sockpuppetry li accuserxeN cheers 
 hi you would be able to respond to much better than i would at the afd talked about i did suggest looking at wmcs article history and talk page but i guess that wasnt enough thanks in advance 
 i added a short comment but im not sure it is worth it the nonsense of solomons claim us clear to anyone who care to check the articles with an open mind i dont know if we can reach the rest 
 an unknown user added 
 i thought that information seemed weird but i wanted to make sure thanks for checking that out 
 re i didnt think to ask i figured the open proxy evidence would be enough i will direct brandons attention to this section though and ask if he can take another look 
 ok thanks 
 the uas appear to be legit 
 ok thanks so either 
 hello this message is being sent to inform you that there currently is a discussion at 
 thanks i have commented but i go to sleep now 
 as in graphics do you mean images or something else 
 i thought you said that sentence about dark metal could be left intact in the article if i had a reference that list you put it in is more fan labels than anything the dark metal reference was more notable because it is what the band and record label are calling cof right now it deserves its own sentence at least 
 no i said the reference would be acceptable not the sentance as a whole as cardinal said im not gonna argue here take it to the cradle talk page uN 
 lol well i used to like them a lot but that was when i liked nu metal bands like slipknot and korn years ago its all very immature stuff then i found better stuff theres a lot better black metal bands believe me but then again if you are more into the popular metal w or e i mean even hair metal had a few good bands and had its moments cof s alright i guess but my point is that there is better stuff second im not gonna be able to find a free image of the band thats almost impossible theres a lot of people right now who are deleting band pictures on wikipedia especially from metal articles thats because its impossible to put up an image and have a fair use that fits the guidelines the few band pictures that are out there now on wikipedia just havent been caught yet 
 lol normally i listen to music as heavy as or heavier than cradle cradle slayer my dying bride nile gorgoroth rammstein these are a select few of my preffered but i wont stay offtopic i admit finding free pictures on wikipedia is a bit of a pain but thats what it means when we try to find a completely free encyclopedia still finding band pictures has been difficult here and on my other main source of contributions 
 wtf did you purposely try to get a +N well anyways all those bands you just named are good except rammstein and c and c but w or e to each their own i dont really think we should even need to find free pictures just find w or e pic off the internet but im sure this would cause legal issues no one should care though im pretty sure most of the metal bands here on wikipedia wouldnt care that someone put a non free pic of them on this site in fact they might even encourage it but of course that is all pov and against wikipedia rules 
 haha i did notice that and chuckled to myself afterwards p and rammstein nu metal you have a funny sense of what nu metal is my friend either way i wont argue bands with you you appear to be more kvlt then me p uN 
 i never claim to be more kvlt than anyone though i do know more than most about metal and black metal especially but i dont look at that as a boast it just happens that im interested in that stuff thats all and no rammstein is not technically nu metal but they have certainly been an influence on some bands of that genre and have at times incorporated elements of the genre into their music they are neue deutsche hxeN rte i mmuch prefer the band that inspired rammstein though which is 
 heh it appears you and i have many things in common id like to apologize by the way if i came off a little harsh during the discussion as to whether dark metal should be added consider this a startover to working with you sorry i tried to make it sound as less queer as possible uN 
 thank you i appreciate that i look forward to working with you in the future i admit that i am quite opinionated and when i latch on to an issue sometimes its hard for me to let go 
 im just the same i looked over you user page and it seems we have a lot in common p uN 
 but please dont do this kind of thing again 
 really whats the purpose its not less incivil if he undoes it what we both want is that he understands his limitations and stays within them but i dont see how this can be achieved by trying to make him jump through hoops this only leads to further alienation 
 it would nto have been retracted as it is not an attack it is a request that wmc stop spamming the fact that i am sanctioned all over the shop when there is no need do i mention his sanctions at every given chance also my daughter was bitten by a dog today i figured i could use wp to get my mind off of it fat chance of a bit of peace here though 
 wikipedia is not here for you to blow off steam if you cant be civil walk away from the keyboard 
 sorry to hear about your daughter i hope she gets well soon but 
 wmc mn said he wanted to get my mind off of it not blow off steam please dont misrepresent what mn said 
 wmc i said as was pointed out i wanted to do something to keep my mind off of the fact that a dog was chewing my N year old daughters face your reply shows the sort of person you are i will not interact with you again ever 
 go to the hospital now take the dog it will likley need to be put down contrary to public opinion in the uk there is rabies there 
 thanks and have you done this in the past just have another quest you might be able to help with 
 i have some experience with the subject whats your question 
 short answer maybe you are right that different people handle it differently there hasnt been much study of the long term effects there are plenty of daily users who are intelligent and productive people as well as plenty who are unmotivated slackers some people mellow out when they smoke pot some people freak out some get energetic some get sluggish some acquire intense focus some lose the ability to focus on anything some wake up some go to sleep most get hungry some people seem not to feel normal unless they smoke pot some try it a few times and decide its not for them some use for years only to decide later that it was a destructive force in their life others feel that it catalyzes beneficial spiritual experiences some of these contradictory things will even happen to the same person if you are curious i recommend researching the subject by reading everything you can find our article 
 gt we get a ton of old proposals which accumulate at 
 fair enough sorry if i came across as too critical 
 stephan what did you mean by is english your native language you seem to fill in a lot of things not said with your assumptions on my talk 
 atren having been and looked there is a bit of a non sequitor i think wmc reverting someone whom he noted was burying the embarrassing bits does not amount to wmc being motivated to embarrass eg i have removed embarrassing bits about the alleged paternity of prince harry from his article and people have occasionally put them back recognising that they were embarrassing but motivated by the feeling they were sufficiently notable noting the embarrassing nature of something does not mean declaring it a consideration in its inclusion stephan is not a native english speaker but i suspect in this case his syntax may be adequate 
 indeed and this is not the only case where you seem to fill in gaps in what was written with your own internal assumptions 
 i have laid out my case in detail below in response to bozmo in case youd like to respond 
 but even given all this perhaps if wmc would explain the edit acknowledge the inappropriateness of it or even apologize for inserting it we might be able to put this aside but he steadfastly refuses to speak about it other than to deny his intent was to embarrass telling us what it wasnt is not enough he needs to tell us what it was and then we can evaluate from there 
 i dont think this version of the 
 or another question ignoring good or bad faith assumptions do you think the edits were at all defensible 
 i dont know his motivation but i have several possible good faith explanation as for the second question blp policy has evolved significantly over the last N months or so and i dont think its useful to now harp over ancient edits 
 stephan blp was firmly established at the time those edits were made and besides they were bad edits even without citing blp at the very least weight notability and pov and please share your good faith explanations if you have them why are you being evasive maybe i will even agree with you even if i cant imagine it myself i might agree with it 
 personally i think the edits were bad but then i said at the time i did not think they should be in the article so thats not surprising there is a problem with the nature of human judgement which means it is very difficult to call bad faith on subjective judgement i think kim and wmc quite often make calls which i can completely understand but disagree with based on the fact they see patterns based on their field of view which run against my field of view they obviously feel that we should give the wp audience a reasonable representation of what an individual is really like on a broad reading of notable sources i generally feel that selection based on the stuff they see talked about is a real distortion risk but they both listen to arguments and so do i it is a bit like iran i regard iran as a perfectly decent country with nice people who suffered greatly under an abusive us puppet government in the past and were a bit dramatic in breaking away from us control than some of our colonies were people who live in new york and read the us newspapers often actually end up with the feeling that iran is more evil than the us and argue stuff like the prime minister of iran is globally most famous for winding up the israelis it is completely absurd but perfectly reasonable us citizens honestly believe it and we have to deal with them perfectly decent people like kim and wmc really think martian stuff is representative of singer being cross with them is not the answer 
 the issue here is that the system is broken for these few editors they have edited so long and have so many defenders that even when there is obvious evidence of either bad judgement or bad intentions they are still allowed to edit these articles now perhaps i have given the impression that i think they are evil for editing this way if i did then i did not intend to its not good versus evil its pov vs npov and these editors have too much of a pov to properly edit these blps regardless of their intentions perhaps i have focused too much on the intentions part and thats muddied the underlying pov issue i may alter my arguments to emphasize that im not trying to prove intent only show the intrusion of their pov into their editing 
 getting a bit ahead of yourself here arent you when have i ever been topicbanned banned or anything of the like do please tell 
 im sorry bozmo listed you and wmc in his comment and i responded clumsily i have struck it but i still stand by the points i made 
 not sure i agree with you on topic bans selfawareness of pov is important not having none outside blps i dont see much of an issue in cc within blps there are cases where this happens but i think reeducation is better than banning 
 ok id be open to reeducation but doesnt that start with the editor acknowledging theres an issue look at the rest of the discussion in this thread and tell me is wmc even aware that the edit was bad or why it was bad i honestly cant tell and despite repeatedly asking that simple question i cant get a straignt answer from them 
 i am done here i dont see why wmc should be held to a much higher standard than we hold others to 
 unbelievable all i asked was for him to explain his edit and im holding him to a higher standard this entire conversation has been surreal 
 notice how atren has elided different issues here obvious evidence of either bad judgement or bad intentions well i disagree but lets assume for the sake of argument these are true that still doesnt lead on to its pov vs npov this is a simple logica failure 
 that is because you areject the premise that this was a bad edit that in a nutshell is the problem 
 i was talking in general rather than about any specific edit if you are still stuck on the martians stuff yes you are correct the substance is true all you are arguing about is whether it belonged in the lede or not 
 you well know that truth can be framed in such a way as to be misleading and thats exactly what happened here when the context of the claim was left out do you disagree with that and furthermore misleading or not do you still believe it belonged in the lede 
 but in any case now that you have found this discussion tell us do you still believe that was a good edit if so why and if not then why did you believe so at the time 
 gosh you are intrusive arent you 
 why not just answer wmc 
 im sorry i probably should have said something to the effect that it would probably be deleted i didnt want to just delete it again and tell you to stop i didnt consider that it would be worse to let it get tagged for deletion by someone else and taken to mfd i was mostly trying to move it out of article space but i ended up setting you up for a nasty experience i apologize 
 i thank you for admitting to your mistake and you were correct about it bieng upsetting however could you just tell me how things like the welcome comittee and the recent changes patrollers get away with it and not wiki doctorates 
 i dont know much about those projects i know rc patrollers are just people who happen to do that task i guess the welcome committee are the same they are not some kind of honor system as anyone can do those tasks you just put your name down if you are active and if you feel like being listed im not sure what they are getting away with its just a list of people who happen to work on one kind of job the only honorifics we really have here are 
 i also supplied what i beleive was a as to the difference but 
 thanks take care 
 no problem cheers 
 hi there is currently a discussion on the talk page of 
 thanks for the headsup its late now but i will have a look at it tomorrow 
 hi i was wondering if you had the above book if so does the book have detailed information on 
 the song reached #N doesnt that book only list #N singles 
 i think this book book lists the top charting singles by an artist 
 hi sorry for the late reply im afraid i dont have that book but i can see some pages from my amazon account and there is nothing about her she appears mostly on lists but there is no information of the song sorry about this if i can help you with anything please let me know regards 
 i got it thanks so much christopher everything is perfect and so helpful again if ever you need help with anything please dont hesitate to ask d thanks again 
 oh wow thanks for that i didnt expect that yes that could definitely be added it will be like background info on their thoughts thanks for keeping me in mind chris all the best 
 hope this helps uN 
 thank you that is strange though i have been putting tags in my comments for a while now and thats the first time its caused a rendering problem 
 the only way 
 claiming that iar is the only way to deal with the situation is the recourse of the intellecutally lazy the way to deal with that situation as with any content dispute is to bring more eyes to the situation and expose your opponents logical fallacies to the light of day since you are correct you will easily convince disinterested parties that you are the reasonable one edit warring is a terrible solution it shows that you dont know how to get things done on the wiki it makes you look like the povpusher when the wider community finally does look and it fails in its aim which is to win the content dispute its like trying to open a closed door by standing in the center of the room and stabbing yourself repeatedly in the leg its a bad idea for multiple reasons if you seriously believe that iar is the only way to deal with a content dispute then you have clearly never tried effective dispute resolution i recommend it making an edit repeatedly in the face of opposition might feel very righteous but its blinkered ineffective and distracting from the good work we are trying to do bringing more eyes is always a better solution 
 thank you for helping return the disambiguation page to 
 no problem happy editing 
 my understanding is that we did want a move just not the one that was originally suggested i have commented more on the talk page 
 i think i fixed it now please let me know if i can be of further assistance 
 see 
 i was just reading it we agree on more than you might think 
 wmc has never answered this and still refuses to atren is lying shamelessly 
 then point me to your answer 
 even you can see the logical difference between not responding yet and refusing once you have done that and relaised that you were wrong above you can strike your error 
 im confused do you intend to respond or do arefuse to respond 
 as a computer person you should understand that this question can be truthfully answered yes or no wether he does answer or not 
 do i really have to draw a 
 i too would be interested in reading wmcs rationale for edit warring to keep that information in the lede for the singer article 
 as would i this entire conversation is an excellent illustration of the many problems with this faction when one person is asked to explain or answer others join in and evade then take umbrage on being called on that simple questions put directly are answered with evasion over and over and attacks on the questioner thrown in for good measure sts you say you have several alternate explanations put some forward then wmc why are you unwilling to answer the questions asked you directly do you think no one notices your tactics ++ 
 if you are interested in in reading wmcs rationale why do you ask me 
 well earlier in this thread you wrote i dont know his motivation but i have several possible good faith explanation so you could share them 
 im going to talk to him about this and revert his changes that were made in error but i would like a mod to back me up so that it doesnt turn into dirt kicking thanks for your help 
 i dont actually know anything about the naming dispute but was just clearing backlog at 
 which do you believe in 
 i thought you retired p you are still not replying to the substantive issue i have raised how by what mechanism does the person whos right win you have got no answer 
 hi there gtb cheers 
 i have started drafting an rfc on 
 i have added it to my watchlist thanks for the headsup 
 you probably know this already but i noticed a few files that you nominated for deletion at 
 thank you yes i found out later i was just so focused on getting all incomplete drs completed next time i will just delete unless i think the image for some reason should be kept 
 if you want to ask me a question you know where my talk page is 
 right and if you guys have trouble locating it here are some links to help or 
 you misspell like a native and you catch the references too 
 i have been reading much fiction in english ever since the later 
 your colloquial english is very good which requires the ability to think within the language and tends me toward a familiarity diagnosis as does the ability to promptly recognise humour of course not being a doctor and not even interested in selling snake oil on the internet means i am not an expert 
 well whenever i feel that my level of english is dropping im rereading one of dorothy l sayers 
 i think your essay needs more work before you tout it so 
 before i tout it so i wasnt aware of going over the top got any specific feedback 
 re your defence of lhvu so you think his agreement with a N month ban for h makes sense 
 i think its a mistake but its an honest mistake i tolerate a wide range of opinions as long as its clear that they are opinions 
 i absolutely agree 
 i hope that more people do so as well i have been thinking for a while about the page 
 yes i would be interested do let me know 
 im interested in that discussion too i find your comment excellently wise gtbacchus i also very much liked this comment by you at 
 speaking of things you said gtbacchus i had forgotten that it was you who had said it but i wanted to thank the person who said the following because it contributed significantly to my about 
 you can go fuck yourself 
 i think thats anatomically implausible 
 can you translate this review for 
 hi mark sorry dutch is about as similar to german as it is to the anglosaxon part of english in other words not very grammar and roots are related which makes it not to hard to learn but apart from that its completely incomprehensible dutch split from what would become current german before william the bastard imported norman french to britain 
 never mind mate andrew posted a translation on his blog can you tell me if the magazine coupled with the translation on bh qualify as reliable 
 i dont know the dutch press very well but would assume that the magazine qualifies montfords translation not however what do you want to use it for 
 it`s a review of the book the magazine is a science magazine 
 so what do you want to use it for and its at best a popular science magazine (like eg 
 sorry i want to use it`s review in the hsi article 
 if you just want to use the review as is the question is less one of reliability and more one of notability and weight 
 it`s a pretty notable magazine it is the one which first published mcintyre`s and mckitrick stuff but what does weight have to do with a book review 
 o and this one from quadrant magazine 
 yes the science seems to be completely wrong several magazines have articles that say the hockey stick illusion has debunked the science that does not prove science wrong you need scientific literature to prove science wrong 
 @mark you need to present exactly what you wish to use the source for so that we can confirm it meets requirements 
 hi gtbacchus i noticed that your name was on the list of active coaches for admin coaching at 
 hi hatmatbbatN thanks for dropping by and for your vote of confidence in asking me to help you become an administrator as i guess you can tell from the coaching page i havent been signed up there long and you are the first to ask me for coaching being new to this im not sure if theres a regular procedure to follow but im probably more comfortable working without one anyway if you are ok with that then im happy enough to accept you as my first coachee i have looked briefly over your contributions and you seem to be a good editor so why not see whether you can contribute as an administrator as well id probably like to start by asking you some questions to get a sense of what you want from the coaching experience but first i think i should let you ask me any questions you may have about myself or about my experience as a wikipedian and as an admin we could set up a separate page for communication if you like or id be happy using whichever talk pages seem convenient 
 yes i would like for you to be my coach i was just hoping i could get somebody to help me and you sound like you could help me a lot right now i cant think of any questions to ask i havnt really looked at your userpage to find out much about you yet for a place to talk i guess we could set up a subpage on either mine or yours for admin coaching im looking foward to getting to work with you soon thanks again 
 oh and by the way i think you need to go to the admin coaching page and say that you have matched my request 
 i have updated the page and i have left you a couple of questions at 
 it should also be noted that the emca spec defines the pronunciation of the language name as c sharp and while this is not definitive proof that sharp refers to the musical note it does agree with microsofts position so it may be considered circumstantial evidence in the current article text it says microsoft clarifies the language name as follows before it makes a reference to the email so the article does qualify that the company is saying this 
 i have posted my review at 
 i have marked the issues that have been addressed however a handful still remain please check the gan review one last time 
 the dutch translation is a bit rough some guesswork in there i`m afraid 
 and a better translation would be the book the hockey stick illusion by the british sciencejournalist andrew montford reveals a staggering picture of how those involved in climate science are dealing with criticism the subtitle climategate and the corruption of science might have been added at the last possible moment and the same for a final chapter about climategate the leaking of emails from the climate research unit at the university of east angliawith possibly moving the second sentence apart as the first sentence is the ending of a paragraph and the second one a start of a new paragraph also i am unsure if sciencejournalist is a real word but the word wetenschapjournalist means a journalist who only reports on science 
 accusing me of being in a faction with scibaby that needs redaction soonest ++ 
 you need to buy a sense of humour i think it sells for us$ N or bushel at wallmart and you need to stop making powerful but unsubstantiated pronouncements oh and when i say faction i mean a mere confluence of editors 
 you need to include a smiley or some other marker given that you dont seem to have any ability for accepting humor thats the least that can be expected i nevertheless expect a redaction or at least clarifying remark at my talk ++ 
 at the risk of repeating myself you need to stop making powerful but unsubstantiated pronouncements 
 i have started work on 
 there was an article on him in world coin news a couple of months ago to which i am a subscriber then i recently noticed the bicentennial guaranteed tfa if i can get it to fa i think dont hurry it will take me a couple of weeks to write the article with the limited time i can devote to it 
 what is your obsession with tfa just the narcissistic pleasure are you aiming for a record and mdash 
 i think it is all about looking for a niche here i started off badly at tfa or r but i have developed into a sort of arbiter of the points system 
 must be the attorney in you definitely a better niche than mine and mdash 
 i wouldnt say that you have far more people who have come to your defense than would come to mine 
 but you dont do things that need defending besides i came to your defense the one time you seemed to have needed it and mdash 
 now i avoid conflict but when 
 well now i am using your strategy and avoiding conflict im sick of it and would rather work on articles in peace besides i dont have enough of a legal mind to argue successfully and mdash 
 so i guess i never really got the thread of what it was we were actually talking about from your perspective in regards to 
 thank you for the message and congratulations on your acceptance to the harvard extension school i think we wont turn into an orwellian nightmare so quickly you can trust that there are at least a handful of sane people keeping an eye out for that it turns out that even in the current context nobody is arguing for prohibitions on namecalling enforced by blocks while npov problems become harder and harder to talk about i realize thats what some people seemed worried about but i think that worry is based on misunderstanding the position being advanced on both sides of the fence what we want to be able to deal with problem editors effectively and efficiently we are not going to hamstring or shackle anyone and we are also going to teach better methods than the bad doggy whap school of conflict resolution the result will be stronger neutrality verifiablity and nonoriginality policies not weaker ones that have somehow been hobbled to make way for civility we know not to push in that direction 
 arent we really all worried about the same phenomenon some of our best admins being rfced and rfared for civility issues some think the admins in question should change their behaviour and some think it shouldnt be so easy to bother them for superficial things perhaps these responses arent mutually exclusive after all in any case congratulations and happy writing 
 just find it funny that the circler is found on every single wikipedia page years ago i got a letter insisting that the ampas needed the mark 
 im not an expert on trademark law so i defer to the mos note however that there are also plenty of instances of wikipedia without a trademark sign and they are on each page ip owners are in general known for rather expansive interpretations of their rights 
 i had a course on patent and trademark law as applied to entrepreneurs and the message given was that courts will only protect those who are zealous in protecting their intellectual property rights wikipedia is zealous by having the message on every content page the requirement is only that each page have the note not that every instance therein be also marked blame my background at compuserve which was rigorous in requiring that forums avoid any legal hassles 
 while here we gladly take on the 
 for clarification zealously enforcing your

 what is the system have you been blocked for supposed incivility what is suicide in this context why bother warning me 
 i have found that google earths synthesized terrain view is extremely helpful in matching a given image to a viewpoint and identifying the subject provided im not running photoshop at the same time both are real resource hogs 
 oh wowwiegood i use google earth all the time to id spotsbut the teton range is easy for mei worked there for a number of years in the N s heading to commons to check these out 
 added image to article 
 used this image to build a new stubnice 
 im at a halt until i get photoshop set up again on another computer my old computer bluescreened last night and isnt worth the trouble to fix but i have to wrangle a photoshop license onto another machine 
 thanks for working those images into articles i dont expect to upload much more for a few days until i can do a clean os install on my newold computer adobe wont install because of conflicts with older adobe products go figure the images are safe on an external drive 
 after four days of fighting with adobes persnickety installation interface i have gotten it working again and will have some more images national park mountains on the list for instance 
 i will check those out this weekend 
 actually national park mountains already uploaded im starting to forget what i have done 
 that pic in the beartooth mountains is now N years oldi took it in N wowmuch appreciatedbut you should continue to look at thread above to see all the great images acroterion has provided us many of mountain peaks that we had either lousy pics of or none at allthanks againi owe you big time 
 just my thoughts 
 you know theres a happy bit of timing going on here i have just been approached in the past week by researchers from a university who are studying wikipedia from a variety of angles the person i met with so far is developing accessibility software and he put me in touch with someone whos been studying conflict on wikipedia i should be meeting with him soon i like your idea 
 i think in wikispace we can just stick ideas up put a proposed tag on it and go 
 if you want to do something like this i think you need to stay clear of any admin elitism or otherwise closed structures perhaps a wikiproject like 
 agreed i also note that 
 i didnt know we had 
 heck yeah 
 i dont think its elitism to say that this is directed at our administrator corps the crux of the issue to me is that we give people admin bits and dont help them understand how to use them effectively and appropriately we dont give them a support structure we dont give them training we dont give them the titaniumplated mindset to deal with trolls and then we end up with administrators who burn out who lash out who do the right thing but in the wrong ways like guy 
 arent good admin conflict resolution skills also applicable by nonadmins most conflict resolution doesnt involve much use of the buttons does it i like the idea of some kind of dr training program which could be available for any user recommended as a prerequisite for adminship and maybe sometimes required by arbcom as a part of some remedy 
 perhaps we can recruit 
 i did not intend to say that this would only be open to administrators only that it would be clearly aimed at helping admins and those who wish to become admins do their thing in an appropriate effective manner this is particularly relevant for those administrators and we need more of them who get involved in the conflictridden parts of the encyclopedia stopping povpushers patrolling blps etc 
 i think its not a double standard just wildly varying opinions some feel that everybody who is unlikely to abuse the tools should get them some believe that you need to contribute to several featured articles fight valiantly in the vandal wars and take a vow of chastity to become an admin 
 i suspect we are in broad agreement 
 and i think we can emphasize the admin candidate aspect i dont disagree that it would be a good thing to have a broader group of people using the tools and if we encourage and help people do this it might encourage more people to apply and more people to pass 
 we have got 
 i am not exact sure what you are referring to in this edit summary but he is identified as an environmentalist in the info box as well 
 i have no strong stance on the environmentalist or not issue i have reverted the edit in question because i believe 
 why did u revert my comment at 
 see my comment at you page clumsy fingers 
 thats cool 
 hi do you know of any easy way to check to see who assessed what articles for ga fa and so on id appreciate some guidance on this if you can thanks in advance 
 i dont think there is a better way than going to the article talk page and follow the links gar is usually done by one editor but far is much more comprehensive and a consensus process that does not mean that you cannot slip a far for an obscure target in under the radar though 
 i think i found what im looking for i dont know too much about this except what i have learned a bit about from 
 you havent realized why the first revert didnt seem to work you were seeing the cached version from the doc page you had it right it just needed a null edit uN 
 i was guessing there was some weird interaction with the caching system but was not to certain thanks for confirming 
 it struck me as an odd photo for a cfd uN 
 i would be happy to accept though i do think you overstate how many fa i have worked towards and am grateful for your confidence and kind words 
 thx will need to draft responses to the questions tonight and notify you on your talk 
 do you need to transclude the subpage on the main one or can i do that now that i have accepted the nomination 
 i cannot you must do that according to 
 i wasnt very happy with myself but it was sourced to something explicitly linking it to dr laura so chickened out in removing it 
 actually we eced i was going to remove the sentence you took out as well i dont see what this adds to the topic and it does cast a negative light on the otherwise nonnotable son 
 hi stephan to talkhalle berry seems to have made a bit of a mess around line N i cant see what you were trying to do so perhaps you can have a look and try to sort it out cheers 
 its and i this seems a copypasta mistake of some sort the text i cut is present elsewhere cheers 
 no idea what happened there but thanks for fixing it 
 yet another is on the rampage right this minute 
 is a bit of a stretch do you think you might strike it 
 its more than a stretch its shameful to compare a wikipedia editor to a woman who risked her life to oppose segregation in the deep south 
 i stand by the comment if not by atrens interpretation i have clarified it though 
 thanks a lot we are somewhat limited because we have N set times and places to be but i will keep this in mind in particular meteor crater 
 please see of a 
 wow thats very cool could you also post to 
 also he should at least submit a paper to wikimania N worst case he gets a free trip to egypt 
 i will definitely pass that suggestion along oh hes 
 i inadvertently missed you out earlier and have had to carry this out now i have put this on editors talk pages where they have been voting feel free to reword if you think what i have done isnt quite right please note that contributors should not be voting here id appreciate it if youd remove your vote what we are looking for is constructive criticism if you arent around i may remove your vote myself and you might want to then modify your comment if you need to respond please respond on my talk page thanks on behalf of the arbitration committee 
 i dont really understand the request i think the proposal in question is fundamentally flawed and should be rejected i stated one reason why if you object to the vote form feel free to strike the vote part and leave just the argument but i see no point it providing alternate wordings for a proposal that is simply broken 
 you might be interested in my of some techniques that seemed to have worked in a very contentious area unfortunately these techniques are not working so well in other areas yet 
 filll i think thats a great start i think you enunciate a lot of very useful principles there what do you think is different about an area where you are not seeing the same method work 
 in addition homeopathy is under probation as a result we cannot be as aggressive as we were in the evolution and creationism area i think removing repeated comments might get a person blocked for example also i believe some admins are rooting for the underdog the poor downtrodden alternative medicine group and civil is now a fairly useful weapon for them which was not the case a year or two ago for the creationists i am far more cautious and careful about even disagreeing with them since disagreeing has been viewed as uncivil npov is not being enforced a clear message to the malcontents is not being sent that we will have npov whether they like it or not they believe that if they argue hard enough and long enough the definition of npov will be changed or they will get an exception from it 
 another daughter article might be on connections of homeopathy with religion some view it as satanism and the work of the devil some view it as tapping into some sort of spiritualism we could also have a subsiduary article exploring more of the details of the energy field and connections to other energy fields or the ether 
 other useful articles in the area that should be improved include 
 theres a lot to think about there one reply i can give you is that people using the civility policy is a weapon is nothing to fear that can be stopped in its tracks every time by applying the right strategy so we do not have to tolerate any uncivil use of 
 if you are able to do so a response to would be appreciated 
 answered there hopefully in a useful manner 
 hi i just imported 
 actually i may have garbled a bit i thought it was just the logistic base but it looks like they drilled a core too i will try to fix it up 
 i couldnt find any foreign in it i will go over it when im back in germany (albeit i have been hoodwinked into giving a presentation at a meeting that starts on 
 i will check it vs the es one 
 i know you gave support to our next collaboration please help our current collaboration 
 meteor crater 
 no nor even the grand canyon or monument valley i did get to climb 
 i saw angels landing from below and stopped at bryce briefly but since i wasnt hiking or camping i dont think i got the real value of those visits bryce is nice but the wp article doesnt have a picture that really captures the forestofchimneys rocks i saw yellowstone has a new visitor center 
 i could do without the camping in most parks but we did camp in lassen volcanic yosemite bryce arches and canyonland we booked anything from boutique hotels to motel N at the other places but if you dont hike you really miss some of the best parts the view from angels landing or the rim of 
 take a look at 
 yes those do it i like this one with the frosting 
 and dont forget to pack the zucchini 
 i see you have begun dabbling at 
 im dabbling there in direct response to people at 
 looking more closely this might be a safe time to get involved in 
 no expect different results this time it seems to me there are some tricks that havent yet been tried 
 i note that one of those who is upset on the homeopathy talk pages has just declared that he thinks the current article is awful and violates npov of course when we have tried hundreds of times to describe what npov is somehow they accidently or intentionally never absorb the definition i have wondered if we should rewrite the documents that describe npov to make the policy more clear should there be exams of the concept more examples it just gets very very tiresome to explain it over and over and over to someone who has had it explained to them N times previously and still continues to ignore what they have been told 
 what helps me in such situations is to imagine working together with my grandmother on an article like 
 what helps me is to think that anyone editing wikipedia might be someone i know replace this with anything that fits for you the point of course being to humanise the person behind the screen try and explain things to them as you would to anyone else and to someone in the same room as you not on the other side of the world 
 unfortunately in my case my parents both ridiculed homeopathy the entire time i grew up they would take every opportunity to point out how ridiculous it was 
 perhaps not a very wise thing to do to spoil the placebo effect of provably harmless medicine for ones childuN having learned about your coi here is mine my mother is a nurse and very openminded about these things some years ago when my gp prescribed me a homeopathic combination drug against hayfever i thought it has a chance to help because i know that in my case there is a strong psychological component and it did seem to work my gp also had some funny energy apparatus which he said is surprisingly effective although he doesnt really believe in it but that was too bogus for me 
 my mother is a nurse and a big believer in mainstream medicine my father is an engineer and a skeptic i am willing to try herbal and nonstandard approaches and have managed to convince my father to try some of those in recent years i have tried homeopathic remedies without knowing they are homeopathic because they are not always so clearly labelled in the united states in all places it is such a fringe belief in the us that few people even know what it is and so packages of homeopathic remedies are not even necessarily prominently labeled as such 
 stephan your comment is a blatant personal attack on another editor with no justification provided i am sorry to escalate but i do not believe wikipedia can tolerate such comments if you wish to reconsider i would gladly withdraw my request thank you 
 no it is not its an observation its not a nice observation but then its neither a nice situation nor nice behavior 
 im sorry you dont seem to see the need for a boundary in what we say about each other i suspect if everyone were permitted to do this eventually you might see the problem 
 oh i see boundaries but they cannot be allowed to become impediments to communication see 
 stephan while your observation is correct saying such things can and will be used against you honesty is not the best policy on wikipedia 
 yeh found a whopping list of diffs against me i should have listened to you r 
 while you are certainly right dont forget the latest cabal newsletter where the change of roles was announced dr bill will become the patient wise silent guy you take over his role as the valiant and compassionate defender of the big climate lie and i get to stay the uncontrollable monkey clown nobody but claN takes serious 
 sorry it went into my spam folder carry on 
 you are probably right i only inferred that richardson started it because he was the only person i could find affiliated with it feel free to change anything the internet is extremely unhelpful with this one 
 wow nice work 
 i have a request in to have the hindi version of the homeopathy article translated into english so we can compare it i also looked at the world book and funk and wagnalls articles on homeopathy and both of them were similar to ours with about N or N or more quite skeptical and critical of homeopathy 
 i also have some references that show that in england germany switzerland holland and france government health services are cutting back on support of homeopathy in the light of numerous repeated studies that showed it had minimal value this has all erupted in the last handful of years and might be driving some of the desperation we are witnessing on the talk page 
 im just tying up loose ends here but but could you please clarify whether you see yourself as an involved admin for ongoing cc enforcement purposes or not the reason im asking is that i was sure id seen a posting from you on just this point but cant find it anywhere and nbsp 
 i think you might have seen my reply that is now archived away in short i dont think you are heading towards a good definition of involved if you rely on content contributions as the only or primary factor and i also dont think involvement in one part of the climate change topic necessarily implies involvement in other parts im uninvolved per the definition used in the cc probation but i dont claim im totally uninvolved and i have not acted as an uninvolved admin in the last several weeks however unless the committee explicitly decides otherwise i will continue to perform routine admin actions as i have in the past im not aware that any of those has raised any criticism except for one opinion months after the fact that i have explicitly and invite the committee to investigate and rule on 
 thanks for the diff and the clarification im not really talking about routine admin actions i was specifically asking about enforcement of discretionary sanctions i hope this helps and nbsp 
 i looked over the german and french versions the french version has a completely unsourced hahnemann quotation at the end in incredibly poor french i tried some obvious german search terms with google and with a pdf version of the N th edition organon but couldnt locate the original german source for this so i just gave up to me this suggests that perhaps the french version is not the best one to base any changes on although of course it provides some details that should be verifiable 
 what i think we should draw from the german french dutch italian spanish etc versions is the overall tone rather than the details the reason i decided to look at these was the claim that homeopathy is much more prominent in the countries represented by these versions and more accepted so i thought lets see how they wrote their wp articles and guess what they were not written very differently than the english version as far as i was able to tell there is a substantial chunk of mainstream and critical material in each of these contrary to the claims of our malcontents here 
 here are things that i really like about the other versions the first sentence of the german lede is very elegant and summarises the most important point the rest is outspoken but uses carefully neutral language avoiding potentially problematic words such as contend and the french version mentions references to homeopathic doses in everyday language in a prominent way i think we can use this in the lede i will try to make a concrete suggestion later and see what happens 
 hello 
 thanks for letting me know i dont think i can usefully reply but if you bring it to 
 an interview on science and pseudoscience enforcing civil instead of npov and similar topics to be published in the signpost is underway you can watch some of the progress 
 very interesting thank you 
 hi littleolive thanks for dropping by your remark about not reinventing the wheel seems apt but i have never studied conflict resolution formally although i guess our article 
 wow 
 you are welcome 
 thanks 
 either the intertubes are jammed or you wrote to me under an unexpected pseudonym on an unexpected topic or you forgot to press send about when should i have received something 
 whatever doug tells you do not send him a cashiers check no matter how much of saddams gold he promises you 
 ever since i got that us$N million in diamonds from south africa i have refrained from taking up lesser offers no matter how much i would like to help widows orphans deposed ministers and bank employees to secure their hardstolen funds from the rightful owners 
 you mean you have never replied to the nigerian finance minister he tells me that he has a very special offer for you 
 sorry wrong stephan my bad 
 ok no worries some people got some amusement out of it at least 
 and to think im hardpressed to find a way to get my one pet article from cclass to bclass 
 wow thank you very much mlauba i really really appreciate it that just made my day 
 howdy i went ahead and moved sunrise hunter to a indef block as a voa one pro forma comment one about how wikipedia has failed and then a rapidfire sequence of vandalism does not seem to be an asset to the project feel free to change if you disagree but it seems like a straightforward voa situation to me 
 no im fine i just saw them on the rampage so slapped on a block to stop them now without wasting much time to evaluate overall behaviour see my block comment 
 i have copyedited the plot section per your request at dyk it now no longer looks like a three year old wrote it i think it could easily pass for an twelve year olds writing at this point 
 i went over it too so now its probably at the level of an N year old foreigner can you verify that i picked the right proposer for the last sentence 
 oops i didnt notice you had even edited it you got it right it really is a crazy movie one minute hes trying to rape her then he apologizes and she accepts his marriage proposal also the tommy character becomes convinced shes prostituting herself and he barges into her home and yells at her my moneys just as good as theirs just close your eyes and pretend im one of them i added some info to clarify the plot and who the characters are a little not sure about the hook will think of a different one later if this one doesnt work 
 i put an alternate one in there but im not gonna lie its not great i will see if i can think of another one tomorrow 
 yes i saw it and found it to be honest a bit boring but maybe others like it better if i have time i might think of one myself unfortunately we have no secondary source for the plot you could make something very hooky from those relationships 
 oh theres this and i used it when writing the plot section to help myself remember all the details i just didnt link it there because usually plot sections dont have citations i tried two more hooks but they are bland as well no worries if it gets bypassed 
 alright i will talk with some people over time and see what i can come up with im leaning towards a project on meta and would like to point out that comparison between wikis might be very enlightening we also probably want to attract folks like 
 ok i will rely on your expertise meta might be the best place for it then i am a neophyte in such things so i would not know the advantages and disadvantages of each option 
 another useful thing about going with meta is that different language wikis have tried different approaches to some of these problems for example german wikipedia has much less tolerance for edit warring than we do from what i understand 
 i think you are doing well make sure you add enough sources and just keep adding content sometimes the wikimagic works and massages what you provide until it is even better 
 i cannot match this as a comment 
 i admit it was a low blow 
 talking of which i have to see my german cousins again soon so you could help me prepare how many decades is it since the last significant german mathematician died 
 hmmm germany shipped off nearly all working brains in the N s and N s and recovery has been slow do you count the exported ones hilbert died in N zermelo ten years later lxfN wenheim died N and ackerman puts us into N zorn is one that left during the nazi regime he died in N konrad zuse was more of an engineer nobody later comes to my mind right now but im a computer scientist few of us have had the time to die yet 
 dear dr schulz could you please immediately stop vandalizing the article about 
 i have read this 
 they are not even very hard any more we used to get a better class of trolls than this 
 see the quote on my main page 
 dont worry about warning the metal to the max user that user has already been warned a few times in other news perhaps you can help me with something on the 
 no problem mate i will take a look at the users page and warn him if he continues to remove the templates eventually he will get banned p uN 
 removing warnings is a perfectly acceptable way of acknowledging the warning navnlos 
 i see archiving them as acceptable but removing them altogether although i realise isnt against any rules i am against this is primarially because as user is banned after so many warnings and if an admin were to see no warnings there when hes already received a final warning he could get away with a level N warning again uN 
 yup i dont think there is a guideline although an admin checks the edit history of a user before a block just in case anyway i probably should have put this section on navnlos talk page silly me hopefully he will stumble upon it either way 
 on the plus side however there are some admins that look at the vandalism itself rather than the number or level of warnings i have indefinitely blocked editors after two edits and no warnings before 
 which ironically is how i give warnings 
 i will allow myself to answer here as this discussion sort of is about me i do not remove proper warnings from my talk page if you look at it you will be able to find a number of things that put me in a bad light i do not make a point in hiding anything what i did remove was baseless gibberish by 
 well it seems that i have been told one side of a story although i do not wish to get involved in whats going on here im not entirely sure what the argument is about or how deep it goes but rather than side with one person i will retract any involvement i have shown here as it seems that my involvement will only cause more trouble uN 
 understandable i hope i didnt bother you too much by interfering but as said i felt i had the proper right to ~ or 
 of course not id do the same if i were in your posistion the way i took it there was no doubt as to who was edit warring but as i said i think i will stay out of this and take a neutral stance uN 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or thank you for being so patient and inversting so much time while trying to help me resolve my emacs and singular problems your kind acts do not go unnoticed and are very much apprciated uN 
 thanks a lot i will put it onto the front lawn with the others 
 you are invited to participate in the 
 is it ok to redefine a wellknow term to mean something else so you can impose a block sure why not they did it to wmc so it must be ok 
 power grabbing without community approval very dangerous and very silly 
 if you have any further comments input or questions please do feel free to drop a line to me on my talk page i am open to all discussion thanks and bull and nbsp 
 just wondering why you closed this now just seven hours after a relist it was finally getting some insightful commentary which you cut rather short 
 all good thanks am i going crazy or did the old page used to update a lot more often than it does nowdays 
 i will be honest here i cant really talk much about this situation its not that im unwilling but more that i have avoided chiropracticrelated articles like the plague based on my initial impressions of them and what i have heard from others i only have a vague idea of what the problems are but i can talk to you about that at least basically the articles are heavily defended by chiropractors these chiropractors are extremely knowledgeable about wikipedia and use this to get their way i have heard more than a fair share of stories of inexperienced editors with an antichiropractic pov who have been either driven off of wikipedia or at least those articles as a result you can see the state of the article for yourself despite the fact that chiropractic is commonly considered quackery or pseudoscience and shows no evidence of efficacy beyond what physical therapy would give you the article reads like a promotional piece for it with only a brief nod to the fact that its controversial 
 just noting that i have just watchlisted 
 here is what a section of the article was at the beginning of now take a look at the same seems something fishy is going on and frankly unless the wikipedia community is prepared to make the changes that i think need to be made in order to transform wikipedia into something thatuN s supportive of npov then things like this will continue the scientific investigation section has been chopped into pieces because of consensus policy do you agree with consensus or npov there seems to be a lot of civil pov pushing on wikipedia 
 thanks for the links to the example and for bumping this thread to the top of my attention i will have a look and keep this article in mind as we develop tools for working on this type of problem im not sure the intent of your question whether i agree with consensus or npov my answer is yes without question 
 i do not understand your answer to the consensus v npov question this is a perfect example of how consensus does pov 
 consensus is not supermajority consensus is defined as all major concerns have been addressed you clearly have major concerns which are not addressed therefore there is no consensus there is no conflict between actual consensus and npov 
 my concerns have been addressed at talk and have been rejected i am out now and now we have consensus for pov i am not going to continue going aounrd in circles i have better things to do than reading wikilawyering nonsense at chiropractic talk the current article is pov and has been pov for over N years i do not see any reason why i should continue there 
 what im saying is thats not consensus and if people are passing it off as consensus its because theres not a large enough participation to reveal that it isnt really consensus if you are not content with the way your concerns were addressed then we have not yet found consensus as for your not seeing why you should continue at chiropractic i wont presume to tell you where to direct your energy doing the same thing over and over is generally not recommended so maybe another approach in general i think time spent arguing with one or two people would be better spent finding four or five more uninvolved ones but thats a very nonspecific adage and possibly not very helpful when you have already been on the case for so long im quite hopeful about some discussion thats occurring about how to improve the way we handle articles on topics such as alternative medicine i will admit that as a wiki and a community we are not very good at it yet i would also maintain that its important for us to get good at it and that its with articles such as chiropractic that we will learn the most im curious you mentioned above some changes that youd like to see made what have you got in mind 
 there are a lot of changes first i want all the obsolete studies second i want to expand most of the article with the latest up to date scientific peerreviewed sources for example i written original wikipedian text for a new costbenefit section i greatly expanded the movement toward science section i improved numerous references using a formatted template i expanded the lead of the scientiifc investigation section i merged effectiveness N and N together currently there is no effectiveness or costbenefit section in the chiropractic article if you want to review my changes you would need to take a look at my deleted sandbox N you would have to go back to the history of my sandbox N and find the edit before i archived it there are different versions i was working on the current mainspace chiropractic article looks like a stub my sandbox N chiropractic article was a mature version worthy of mainspace consensus runs afowl with my suggestions i will not continue talking at chiro time to move on specifically as a first step towards npov these sections are obsolete and newer studies exist the manga report and workers comp sections should be deleted asap the lead for the scientific investigation should also be deleted asap i have already written an expanded lead to the scientific investigation section and updated the movement towards science section which describes the manga report in a historical way the manga report itself should be deleted but some editors want to keep the obsolete and dated studies newer studies about the costeffectiveness and riskbenefit of chiropractic exist and has been 
 what is the root cause of disruption on wikipedia there are different forms of disruption one type of disruption is deleting information from an article without a valid reason and ruleslawyering the talk page if the text is restored then it will be reverted as no consensus for no good reason this kind of disruption happens everyday on wikpedia this disruption continues because no one is able to prevent it admins are unable to do anything about it thus this type of disruption is encouraged because nothing is done to stop it do you have any suggestions on dealing with any of the npov problems inherent to wikipedia how can i improve an article and avoid getting reverted again 
 i see you and ra crossed out some alleged sock entries trouble is those editors are not currently blocked for sockpuppetry although you might be privy to inside info uN 
 see 
 aha a sock farm which still leaves open the question of where sat came from uN 
 i like the sockmasters comment on the N th if i had a wife i wouldnt want her looking at it either which says more about the editor than he might have intended uN 
 im kind of surprised that wasnt on the list uN 
 so please could you undo that because it doesnt seem to be a workable strategy the dominant term usage for fiberglass is for the reinforced plastic 
 if some one is talking about a hockey stick made of fiberglass it isnt wrong because it is made out of the fiber there are other components with it but basically it is made out of fiberglass the fiber a brick home is made from more than brick but we still use the name of main material in common parlance that doesnt mean we have to move brick to redirect to brick or insulation or framing composite a fiberglass boat is made of glass fibers at its core so unless you are talking about things much more technical like the polymers you can use saying fiberglass in reference to the fiber is not wrong 
 but i aint taking no shit from you you think you are all that cos of ur admin powerz you cant stop me you little bitch im gonna mash you to a pulp 
 what are the chances that this character is the guy in that sun piece his typing is about as bad but thats the internet for ya uN 
 hi stephan i issued a general thanks to everyone who replied to my question about latex at the reference desk but i want to acknowledge your answer especially i probably would have given up on the idea of learning to use it if you hadnt stepped in with your comments thanks so much for giving me the benefit of your lights there i appreciate it best and nbspuN and nbsp 
 you are welcome it took a while for me to get into latex but i find it excellent for many applications especially now combined with pdf generating drawing tools last year i prepared slides for a new course and i found 
 latex is a very steep learning curve and once you get past it it can make your life easier from producing everyday nicelooking documents to submitting academic papers to even making websites plus lots of other software uses latex and or or tex interpreters so im glad you are not giving up 
 thanks again stephan for this additional info and you too awickert for your encouragement and nbspuN and nbsp 
 while working on the rewrite and putting together author cv john mentioned he had coauthored a paper as part of his thesis work with his thesis advisor at school and by the way his thesis advisor had once cowritten a paper with paul erdxfN s i was gobsmacked as my coauthorship with john gave me an attractive number however as we did not complete the rewrite article i technically cannot claim the credit i thought i remembered thinking that abandoning the rewrite didnt cost me the number because i had the original paper with john but that doesnt appear to be the case too bad as the original assignment of authors could have been just about any combination but it is what it is so i will remove it the irony is that when i saw the template it meant someone here cares about it and i had hoped someone would ask what unfortunate timing 
 sorry i just tried to make a joke i didnt want to burst your number i always use for computing erdxfN s numbers but it probably does not know about actuarial papers the only philbricks that come up in their data base are douglas and c russel burkett indeed has an erdxfN s number of N 
 thanks for simply striking and not making a bigger deal actually im quite mortified as i always thought there was some question about my claim but i honestly thought i had coauthored with john i was once the north american editor of and we had a multiyear battle to get listed in the i resigned my position before it got resolved and it looks like it hasnt yet succeeded that journal was more oriented to academics than the casualty actuarial society publications so i have no doubt the places i have published dont make the usual lists 
 see does that clarify things

 thank you uN 
 hi you were active over at the 
 hmmm i dont remember when exactly i joined the discussion at 
 hey no problem being busy as for the template i dont know when it would be used but maybe i should go there and start a discussion to delete it since to me it seems to be used to make a point and also as an attempt to maybe stop discussions then again maybe im being too sensitive about it thats why i need a sanity check from someone i know and trust i hope you had a nice thanksgiving dont worry about the article it will be there with the image somewhere im sure take care and thanks 
 thanksgiving > wrong continent but i was invited to a real american turkey dinner when i taught at u miami in N i will have to say that the appeal of pecan pie turkey breast and gravy is less strong when the aircon is struggling to keep the temperature below N degrees centigrade 
 sorry i keep forgetting this is not a universal holiday which is a shame since it consist of good food and usually good company at least it is for me are you saying you taught at the university of miami like in fl or is this somewhere else i have a reason for asking 
 yes i taught and at the 
 i had a long talk last night with kim bruning bruning has clearly thought about these issues a huge amount and has some information and links that are informative he is working on setting up some sort of central location or institute i would love to start slowly collecting information on this issue and organizing and centralizing discussions there 
 sounds interesting could people keep me in the loop as well 
 well as you might know from the stuff at raymond arritts expert withdrawal pages i am trying to see if i can get sufficient interest to organize a wikipedia institute where we could interact with outside investigators studying wp host assorted whitepapers have conversations about new ways to organize ourselves on wp potential statistics collection projects and experiments etc of course one of the first and most pressing areas to address is conflict resolution and documentation of controversial topics if you get a skype account it would be helpful 
 like vassyana was saying in the previous section on this topic hes just created

 i have read the page and simply dont understand what a rouge administrator is 
 you need to get the 
 that is going to be a problem for me since i dont believe in cabals and if i dont believe in them they may not believe in me 
 proxy editing for a blocked user isnt a good idea im more than a little surprised that an admin would do that 
 do you think im hurting wikipedia raymond i have noticed that you are rather critical of my words and actions lately are you unhappy with my involvement in the articles you edit do you think im doing something wrong by trying to help work that situation towards resolution or do you just disagree with how im doing that or what whats up 
 by the way if that content is hurting wikipedia why havent you deleted it 
 my impression is that proxy editing for blocked users is seen as undesirable but maybe im wrong do you think its ok to do so should we post a query at 
 well i dont think im proxy editing for a banned user im not making edits for him to encyclopedia articles and i explicitly told him above that i wouldnt make edits to the article on his sayso either way im not really concerned with what a rule somewhere might or might not say im concerned with whether or not the encyclopedia is improved (call it 
 it will be a lot of work but i think that is the best way to capture all this energy people are wasting otherwise 
 how do we start shall we begin by making a list of studies and then start annotating it what do you think 
 sure start a list in a sandbox there are just hundreds of these i wanted to start with a sort of outline of text but a list is fine too 
 text is good im just not in a position to write any until im a bit more familiar with the terrain i am at work now so i cant jump in with both feet until later today when i start a page i will post a link here or if you beat me to it please do the same 
 if you have uploaded other files consider checking that you have provided evidence that their copyright owners have agreed to license their works under the tags you supplied too you can find a list of files you have created in files lacking evidence of permission may be deleted one week after they have been tagged as described on

 uN just as an alternate perspective sometimes an exhaustive list of primarysource journal articles is not the best starting point for example i could cite more than a dozen peerreviewed pubmedindexed articles stating that hiv cannot possibly be the cause of aids but it is its way too easy to mine primary sources like journal articles and arrive at a skewed impression of a topic it might be more useful to start with reliable secondary sources such as review articles the

 if you could i wish that you could tell people at the cfdi talk page to disregard her suggestion to remove the wikileaks source and everything based on it and just go back to ordinary editing otherwise this is all going to blow up again 
 i cannot tell people what to do what i can do is telling them that admins have no special power and that someone who relies on his or her admin status in a content conflict is wrong and should not be given any special weight 
 gtbacchus what i see is that there was bigger majority in supporting use of diacritics in wikipedia titles than in moving this article as an argument you say that the community has been quite consistent about saying when asked that we follow established english usage i would like to see some arguments for that i was trying to find but i found no proof for that no other similar page was moved take a look at 
 i can provide dozens of examples of page moves where we have consistently applied the rule of following the consensus of reliable sources please check back in a few hours when i have had the chance to find them or you can look back through the history at 
 hi stephan as an experienced editor who knows all policies by heart i would like to request some orientation about wiki policies regarding a proposal to do a batch or mass article merger involving more than N articles i really appreciate if you can drop by and provide some guidance about the proper way to proceed

 thanks for your opinion on this matter 
 is there any progress on that list or statistics almost all pages about people in english wikipedia i found either still use diacritics and non english name or move was never requested i can bet that ratio between pages with diacritics and moved pages is more than N

 done be happy 
 i am happy thanks i have been called an asshole twice today on wikipedia so i must be doing something right 
 i have to say that i find this list of yours quite interesting 
 how so 
 i like systematic approaches to problems first of all your list showed me that there are pages that were also moved like novaks i asked couple of times and i searched but this is the first time i see that these pages exist secondly i also started to create lists like you did take a look at 
 thats a very interesting page im not sure you have established that there are many more articles not following 
 i have started reading bookers book needless to say he makes some very serious allegations about the nature and quality of the ipccs stance on the modern warming period im reserving judgement for the moment on much of bookers conclusions and would like to check them against some other sources booker basically gives a history of the agw movement with criticism of how it developed and came to its different conclusions i checked amazon and of course found a large number of books which support the ipccs stance on the issue would you have a recommendation of a recently published book or books that give a history of the agw research but does so from a neutral or prostance 
 regarding the history 
 im going to start reading wearts online edition thank you for the recommendation 
 glad to assist it does give a lot of context of the political context in and related sections which i have been skimming 
 thanks one big problem with einstein is that we really need a source connecting his concept with modern id uN there are plenty of references saying that paley was a predecessor and as i recall the same applies or should apply to the others the other problem is that einstein didnt conceive of a higher intelligence behind the ordered cosmos like

 thanks the sentiment is not original but i will accept authorship for that particular version of it 
 thanks i added it to 
 no worries i agree that removal was not the best of ideas but it was as good faith as our answers so its no big deal to me 
 thanks for your levelheaded contributions regarding filll and me guy has started to respond constructively to the rfc and explained the particular incident i highlighted i am no longer interested in filll or his comments so please if you see me rising to him again could you drop me a line on my talk page reminding me to cool down and walk away i would appreciate it thanks again 
 if i see it i will do that happy editing 
 what stephan said is unflattering but it is true verifiable and made about a public official whose privacy is not at issue no blp violation here 
 raul you are joking right 
 about stephan calling bush a torturer absolutely not hell hes proud of it not a blp violation not even close and im getting very tired of seeing the blp policy stretched like taffy to cover things it was never intended to cover in order to stifle discussion 
 stifling discussion the thread was about how nutrition in american prisons allowed prisoners to bodybuild and stephans comment had nothing to do with that conversation instead he was enlightening everyone on his negative opinion of bush he said i spit on bush the torturer in the edit summary also bush did not say in your link i am a torturer so you are not accurately representing what it said instead putting your own subjective interpretation on it bush said i ordered waterboarding not the same thing so it is a blp violation as well as an inappropriate comment 
 as for its relevance if stephans comment was irrelevant to the reference desk discussion then that is what a quest for knowledge should have said here he made no mention of it instead aqfk used twisted the blp policy and stephans comments alleged irrelevance to the reference desk discussion has no bearing at all on whether or not it was a blp violation 
 i have not much to add to what raoul said however i did not write i spit on bush the torturer i wrote spit on bush the torturer i should probably have added an exclamation mark its not a simple statement of fact its a suggestion publicly showing our disgust for torture and torturers is something we all should do for the health of society 
 its a notgettingofftheground attempt to abuse civil if theres no effect then theres no abuse i see nobody buying that accusation do you im typing a comment there now 
 i have to save somewhere 
 thanks i hope im casting the idea in a language that makes more sense to the target audience im not always good at that and i have been fumbling for new tricks 
 hey thanks for doing all that hard work you are putting into the 
 im going to be getting a copy of the usl handbook and when i receive it i will add in their official attendance stats 
 im a member of the admin staff for for 
 whoop whoop 
 so the british editors are up and probably at work goddamn i should get to bed soon 
 who do you call british next you will claim i graduated from oxbridge or something 
 limeys krauts frogs its all just 
 would you consider appearing on it is easiest with a headset or you can use a microphone and speakers it is also possible to do it with a telephone in the us and canada i have done it twice so far and it was sort of fun 
 yes im interested thanks for the note im also back in town and on spring break so i have time to do things i will pick up a headset today and post here when i have done it 
 i should say that i basically agree with stephans opinion on this being torture but i am shocked that some very experienced wikipedians above still dont get the distinction between admits waterboarding and admits torture and this ongoing problem of established editors conflating their own opinions with actual fact is a huge problem here and even arbcom seems reluctant to deal with it this kind of stuff is why i find myself so often in disagreement with people with whom i otherwise share a world view 
 oh i get it i just disagree fact and opinion are not diametrically opposed and it is a fact that waterboarding is torture as much as its a fact that the earth is roughly spherical for both opinions you find fringers that oppose it that does not change their status as fact heck even bush weaseled out of answering the question if waterboarding would be torture if applied to us prisoners by others 
 you really believe that earth is round is as unambiguously factual as waterboarding is torture areally stephan do you not see how absurd that assertion is 
 well if you put it that way no that the earth is round is a scientific claim about out reality and thus in principle refutable that waterboarding is torture is an ontological fact about language and concepts and correct by definition so no the claim that waterboarding is torture is more factual than the fact that the earth is round however the difference is negligible in practice the approximate shape of the earth is established fact by any useful definition of fact 
 actually i also agree that waterboarding is torture you cant on wikipedia however call a living person a torturer as it is a violation of our blp rules its also as well inappropriate to bring it up out of the blue in a reference desk dicussion in order to publicize our political views to other wikipedians its an example of boorish behavior alienating other editors who might otherwise respect the editor in questions opinions on a wide variety of topics 
 sing hey the mystic sailor that you are much though it is good to have a go at bashing tgs about waterboarding i dont agree that it is possible to determine completely whether either of these statements are true without first deciding who your observer or mind is you cannot relate words to the real world without some sort of mind to do it and commonality between minds is fortunate and prevalent but not assumable sure i regard both as facts but that does not mean i can assume another rational being will in either case unless i define rational as always agreeing with me i kind of badly explained this but i dont recommend my own skills as a communicator 
 could you please provide a citation for the fact that he is deceased per 
 never mind i finally found one cheers 
 ok install skype then and we can talk 
 dont want to talk 
 no its not that i have just been using my spring break time strategically and have been keeping fairly busy with a couple of projects i have installed skype and just need to fire it up and add you as a contact im not posting from home just now but i will give it a try later this evening are you in a time zone near mine 
 stephan schulz you know very well that this person never tortured anyone nor has there ever been any conviction by a single court of law you are supposed to be an admin act like it 
 bush didnt torture people i suppose superficially that is true however it is a wellestablished principle in law that whoever orders something be done is ultimately responsible for the effects of their orders and mdashsee 
 you like stephan and raul seem not to understand the difference between measurable scientific fact and ontological assertion thats a real problem around here 
 oh my 
 yes you have a heretic in your midst call in the high priests to banish me for daring to challenge your dogma 
 im confused now can you please point out which of your statements are intentional nonsense and which ones you think should be taken seriously 
 you cant tell the difference oh my 
 that you would attempt to lecture anyone on scientific facts is laughable given your editing history here 
 would you care to cite specifics i challenge you to find diffs where i have been in opposition to scientific facts i only oppose the religion of scientism that is so active around here not science itself 
 thank you for making my case for me 
 i wonder if i can persuade you to consider a areal world chit chat at 
 indeed i still have to install skype i guess thats my project for today id be happy enough to talk before next monday while im still on spring break but anytime is fine aiming for seattle evening time is a good idea if we are doing it next week 
 yeah N utc is too early for me im still at work then most days 
 how does N utc fit it certainly works better for me but we may lose our friends in europe at that point im going to go ahead and suggest that as a time and hope that you might be able to make it cheers 
 lets see N utc is N here we are still talking about monday i actually have a tutoring appointment just ending then and it takes me another half hour to get home that time would be great on a tuesday thursday or friday sorry to have a difficult schedule ( 
 its no worries about your schedule i have gone ahead and suggested the time N hours later if you think you can make it could i ask you to 
 firstly the use of a female singer is hardly notable but i believe you added it claiming that claudios voice was failing him or something along the lines mentioning this would clasify as 
 the same really could be said about 
 im going to remove my comments on wpciv asking olive to move her comment should i remove yours too when i do this 
 sure that seems fine 
 i may have already cited these but i think a lot of the good work guy has done has been in the area of otrs and interfacing with people in the real world who are mad about things written on wikipedia he led the effort to turn 
 i find it funny that you are replying here you say that the rfc has achieved all the constructive purpose it can achieve but the reason i asked there is because i thought it would be constructive there to balance out some of the negative comments with positive ones as its likely that we would find there many people who are unaware of guys good contributions with me you are largely preaching to the choir although i didnt know much in the way of specifics i would hope that it wouldnt be inappropriate at a user rfc to detail some of the good work they have done but thats your call 
 my collapse of part of the 
 no hard feelings 
 that collapse caused me to develop 
 i saw your comment about the ussr cosmotheory and i was wondering if there was anything parrallel in modern prc 
 my apologies for overlooking your comment from earlier i do not know the answer to your question but i do not believe so the prc diverged from the ussr on quite a number of controversial topics 
 now on the suite of homeopathy articles things are heating up and you might want to take a look at the talk page of 
 magical theres nothing magical about the fact that people respond well to being dignified i will have a look 
 seems to have played out for now but with frustration and accusations on both sides this seems to be typical of many disputes maybe a copy of the dispute on a work page with a post mortem how more constructive strategies could have been applied would be helpful 
 that doesnt sound bad theres certainly no need for frustration or accusations over a simple matter of checking whether a source is reliable or not the only question to ask is is the source reliable for the article in question in this case its pretty clear that it has consensus support as a reliable source that could have easily been established without any remarks such as i invite you to continue down this path if you want to find out what biting is but then we might start coming across as adults at least on one side of such conflicts that would be terrible huh 
 hello stephan schulz i recently made to the article to improve the pov but was reverted i would like to know if you would be interested in giving your opinion this is the 
 i have some concern about your pov there jefferson was a great thinker and i quite admire many of his thoughts but that does not mean we should whitewash his actions to fit modern sentiments as far as i can tell jeffersons opinions on the indians were very much practical and ruthless and applying N or N hindsight to find excuses for some of his actions is not a very 
 i dont deny this i just wanted to inform readers why he was so ruthless some wp editors judge him by todays standards and depict him as a cruel heartless monster taking statements and events out of context 
 there seems to be quite a lot of rubbish both in public domain and in the wikipedia article on heat pumps particularly in the context of domestic heating aside stating up front that efficiency is unhelpful as a word before misusing it frequently in our article things like claiming that heat pumps cop approaches N when the outside temperature falls to N xbN f due to carnot efficiency limits looks like utter tump meanwhile i am trying to find any kind of diagram of how the heat exchange within a ground source heat pump occurs any ideas who actually knows about these things they have existed in your neck of the woods for ages 
 well the cop approaches N when the lower temperature reservoir reaches N k so its not all wrong i looked at 
 stephan im not asking you to undo your protection of activist but in future you really mustnt use the tools in relation to anything your wikfriends are involved in there are plenty of uninvolved admins around who can deal with these things 
 im plenty uninvolved in this particular spat of the woods i dont really want to get into a discussion but i think you are employing very different standards of uninvolved for yourself and others probably because you have a better insight into your own motivations however id really prefer if you grant that same leeway to me i have looked at the activist trainwreck for months and i really dont want editors to grind themselves up there for little gain 
 its not about internal mental states and that you protected the wrong version shows you meant well and i accept that the point is that over the last couple of years the community has developed a more extensive definition of involved anyone wanting that page to be protected could have gone to rfpp and made a request there of one of the admins who patrol the board 
 it was brought up on a neutral admin venue and 
 you have only protected around N articles in your entire time here almost all pages you or your friends were editing so adding this one to the mix doesnt look good thats all im saying its up to you 
 indeed i rarely use my tools at all and i only act in situations i understand fairly well those typically are pages i have on my watchlist and pages get onto my watchlist nearly exclusively by me editing them no surprise there i find that more useful than the helicopter boss approach ymmv 
 no you have not advocated those positions or at least those exactly however it is not unrelated there are people in the civil is most important camp who take positions not very far away from that when civil is extrapolated and extended and standards are lowered this is where things head although civil is clearly a good thing one can have too much of a good thing i am not the only person who notices that maybe things are in danger of getting out of balance with an overemphasis on civil one of the primary criticism of wp now on places like wr is that we are not civil enough these are exactly the kind of extreme positions that their comments lead to they use civil against us beause it is a potent weapon at the moment as you have remarked previously you do not like it when i use the 
 oh goody a numbered list either name them or lets not talk about them i cant speak for anyone other than myself and i dont believe that any wikipedian holds the caricatured position you have described i think thats your own invention you may be correct about what would happen if the civility policy were extrapolated and standards lowered but since nobody i know is arguing to extrapolate 
 your implication that the rationalist proscience editors treat others like dicks typically is not really appreciated 
 filll i dont think that rationalist proscience editors necessarily treat others like dicks i think it can happen that any editor might act like a dick when they are not using their best judgment my above statement didnt imply that proscience editors treat others like dicks typically i didnt say a word about proscience editors because i see dickishness on both sides of pretty much every fence on the wiki what i have said consistently is that we will do well to treat each other with respect and not with contempt you are right that its not very helpful for me to characterize contemptuous treatment as being a dick i apologize for that unhelpful use of inflammatory language i absolutely dont think that proscience editors are typically dicks i think that being pro or anti science and behaving constructively or not in a dispute are entirely unrelated 
 yeah thinking about this further i really dont know where you would get the idea that i think rationalists have got the market cornered on dickishness thats just bizarre i have taken people on both sides of this dispute to task for being unconstructive if you cherrypick for instances where i was talking to someone with a proscience pov then i guess you are happily inventing reality and maybe i shouldnt bother you however out here in the world people actually live in i have been very consistent saying that everyone would be smart to put down the ad hominem remarks put down the personal labels and talk about content rather than about each other maybe youd like to twist that utterly reasonable position into some indefensible straw man but you are not convincing anyone my position is actually just that we can be professional as opposed to hotheaded unprofessional and contemptuous do you honestly disagree with that i doubt that you do 
 also purporting to lecture others from a presumed or assumed position of moral superiority and hypocrisy are not really working in your favor 
 an assumed position of moral superiority an assumed position of hypocrisy i certainly dont assume any of that i dont believe that moral valuations have meaning so how can i assume moral superiority im claiming that treating others respectfully is more effective than treating them disrespectfully thats not a moral claim its a pragmatic one im sorry if my tone upsets you i will try to adjust it if i can understand what you are offended by i assure you that i see you as morally flawless infallible in fact that has no bearing on specific practical skills that you may or may not have if you were trying to solve an integral using substitution and i were to suggest integration by parts as more effective i would not be holding myself morally above you and it would seem odd for you to take it that way again though im sorry that you are offended and i will be very careful to eschew all language that would imply moral judgment 
 thanks for what you wrote on that other page about the email much appreciated 
 my pleasure we often disagree but i cannot stand either bad arguments or personal attacks 
 do you think you could take a look at my report at 
 our limit for protection is typically several instances of disruption per day i dont see that at 
 righto cheers stephan uN 
 can you help me in the last concern that is in lisa simpsons pr 
 done 
 thamks and have a late but happy haloween 
 thanks hope you have great holiday too 
 left are you good at reviewing articals 
 yeah but i dont have time to review any articles right now sorry or 
 no worrys hey which do you perfer for the tfa of the simpsosn 
 homer i already replied there 
 dude i was way back before april N i only started editing since about oct N i came right in to an extremely nasty environment on wp and thought that as so often happens the policy was just something people liked to have out there not something actually practiced as i didnt see it being practiced not civ not npov not rs not anything but rather used to be mean to new users and bludgeon each other scienceapologist and a couple others taught me what was ok by example uN uN 
 im sorry you thought there was an environment on earth or in the universe where being something other than consistently excellent was a good idea you are certainly not to be blamed for some mistaken notion you used to hold 
 yes the fact was that i was excellent both in sourcing my edits and being civil and not pov pushing else the arbcom would have at least said something more than that id done a bit of edit warring surely id have been reported at least once for actual incivility by now anyway that sounds about like my apology to antelan if you have got me down as being trollish i wont trouble you any more but basically i have a lot of respect for you and the things you have been saying and id have hoped youd get a higher opinion of me than you seem to i do come into situations and basically reveal what i believe to be the basic underlying zeitgeist and informational reality but i feel that this does not really produce negativity but rather puts the conversation on an honest footing and thus promotes a harmonious solution if such is possible uN uN 
 i dont have a low opinion of you i criticize people whom i respect otherwise whats the point if i dont respect you i wont say anything i consider you a valuable wikipedian and a fellow member of my species therefore my brother i assume you are here trying to make the world a little better just like the rest of us what higher opinion can there be than that the concept of being reported for incivility why do you think of it as a law that so misses the point if you must think of wpcivil as a rule apply it only to yourself never to others and never assert that you have been civil i havent got anyone down as being trollish havent i said enough that that should be obvious whether revealing what you believe to be the underlying zeitgeist of a situation might of might produce negativity depending how you say it there are a million ways to be honest 
 so thanks for the criticism ( to explain to be excellent in the environment to which i came i had to choose between getting out of that mean environment and applying every bit of wit and stubbornness i had to combat the barrage of false wiki lawyering and dislike which came at me and i got it for edits much like my recent ones to 
 hi stephan thanks for your note on my talk page i hadnt seen what you had deleted and did at first misunderstand your comment have added more to mine its frustrating to have people trying to impose their ideas on that article just because they dont like the facts hard to engage all the time but i try to keep track 
 no problem thanks for the clarification 
 thanks for all your efforts to keep the article on track 
 fwiw i dont think he was canvassing since he notified editors in a neutral fashionthose who had edited the article at some point including those he knew might take a stance against him 
 well he violated 
 yes you choose the corpus in the dropdown box here are how did he violate wpcanvas i thought the wording was neutral 
 all books known to google at this pointabout N million which is only about N per cent of all books published i dont know much about it beyond that 
 please have a word with this guy and explain to him that his colleagues arent lying i just blocked him for disruptive editing so he probably wouldnt be receptive to advice from me id like to observe your approach to see if i can learn from it thanks 
 hi raymond i am a bit busy at work this week with quarter grades due and im also helping my employer deal with a legal issue whenever i find some good wikitime i will have a look and see if i can speak with him thanks for the heads up and i hope i have a chance to chime in before its all blown over 
 obviously he has burned just about all his bridges and does not seem to realize what the goals of wikipedia are or that this situation is serious 
 i have got half a day of work left before the weekend if he can last that long or not i will talk with him 
 many thanks for your thoughtful comments at 
 your welcome as a general rule ships haul incredible amounts of stuff very cheaply 
 pardon my edit but i must inform you that i had to refer an editor to the noticeboard for his fringe theories your conduct is fine but since you were involved in the dispute i cited your discussion and warnings to him on this matter as well as those of other editors you can see it here and if i misquoted or inaccurately posted something involving you then please say so just to clarify im not asking you to comment on that page just to make known any errors i might have made involving your words or edits i dont want this misconstrued into 
 in his edit yesterday i understand he refers to you and schulz as the N other editors who said no one knows the nature of the hemings relationship when he cited this well we dont know all the details but id say hes taking it too far and stretching your comments into support for his denials or speculation that hemings may have begun the relationship to his claim i responded i regret it has come to this but must inform you of it 
 it sure looks like a long list of ads but it could be a useful item if it was limited to the top N or N per country it wouldnt be so bad but things like the addition of rootN which are probably not notable dont help it i supect that anyone removing things is likely to start an edit war 
 yeah i can see it being useful if it restricted itself to one or two possibly the top three in each country but it is getting out of hand over there at 
 and please dont try to interpret this as petty wikipolitics this is a genuine request for information to try understand how this new calculation can be so different 
 unlike boris im no expert but as far as i can tell the use of the latest hitran data is not very relevant it may slightly improve the modeling of the absorption and transmission of infrared light but we have had good enough data for that for a long time and its hence unlikely to have a major influence on the result if you measure the distance between new york and washington its not very relevant if your calipers are graduated to millimeters or micrometers 
 i cant find the full paper besides a note saying that it will be read at the egu general assembly N in vienna linking to the pdf seems to be failing for me so heres a link to the google search to the http or or tinyurlcom or N kcqqN cm or see also for some discussion on the paper 
 i have seen the two page abstract but not any full paper the tinyurl link fails was that supposed to lead to the full paper rabetts comment points out the same problem as boris does you cannot model the atmosphere as a single layer if you do that you will of course get saturation effects once nearly all infrared light is absorbed but in reality each successive layer of the atmosphere can reabsorb and reemit infrared thus keeping heat in the lower atmosphere 
 hi gtbacchus i posted a message 
 i have replied there thanks for the headsup 
 i wasnt sure exactly what you meant at the time but i think we are pretty much on the same page thanks for stopping by to clarify and also for the vote of confidence i look forward to seeing you around the wiki 
 man i worship you i loved your rfc comments 
 there is a in which we could use your input 
 please discuss articlespecific issues on the article talk page i will move this discussion there 
 which currently appears in the in the news section of the main page and strikes me as misleading 
 yes you are quite right and the sources agree the stratosphere was unusually cold which may be due to the increased greenhouse effect its certainly not the effect of unusual cold in northern hemisphere 
 thanks i will stop panicking its been fixed 
 i have been trying to contact you via email but havent gotten a response just checking to make sure that you have been getting those emails that they are not getting lost in the tubes cheers 
 hello wow i am a space cadet it seems i got your email but somehow didnt connect that today was today and what that meant i feel very silly right now please feel free to call or email and i will apologize a couple of times and we can set something up sorry 
 posted on behalf of 
 i am 
 he regards 
 okido i was a bit worried about you doing his legwork but if he requests it im fine with it i dont really think it needs a statement just now 
 about this i have seen statements that lead me to believe that many believe this both inside and outside wikipedia read articles in 
 i have yet to see it i dont have time to read wikipedia review i just read one register article that didnt remotely approach the position you are claiming id love to see one link to somewhere that someone says that if we would just agf more then everything would be ok i have never ever seen that claim made i would be very happy to see it once 
 if live examples do exist why not link to one or more when you say its a charge thats frequently leveled i have a hard time believing that 
 but do stick around the article is an embarrassment at present and desperately needs attention we may disagree on emphasis but you are a careful and experienced editor who can help with this if you are so inclined best regards and thanks in advance 
 bump can you please indicate what part of my revision you object to preferably at the article talk page tia 
 i dont find extensive participation on that talk page good for my schedule or sanity at the moment there is too much 
 thanks i hope you do return to help fix the thing and certainly understand any disinclination to refight the last war which is what seems to be in progress now sigh best regards 
 in my view what do you think i think he should not express his obvious hatred against this person in his edit summaries this is after all a blp regards 
 i dont find that edit summary very helpful but at least he names no names and makes no direct allegations so it may be another sign of his world view but i dont think its actionable 
 just letting you know that results from a phd thesis unpublished elsewhere are never considered seriously in the area of science i am working this is basically a private communication which does not mean it is necessarily wrong and can not be used for sourcing good luck with your administrative duties 
 we have discussed this at 
 to be more precise when one prepares an article for publishing in a scientific journal he can occasionally refer to his own unpublished data to a private communication from dr x or to a phd thesis of student y however if these references are essential to justify main conclusions of the publication the manuscript can be rejected by reviewers 
 no for all serious universities a phdthesis has to be published as part of the process traditionally by providing sufficient copies to the university library but more frequently by contracting a publisher or in recent times by depositing it in a reliable electronic repository most often again with the university library you cite the thesis not unpublished data or private communication both of which is indeed bad practice 
 of course i am aware of the process it looks very much like selfpublishing by the student and his scientific advisor who makes every effort to publish all important results elsewhere because he wants these results to be read by other people i hardly ever used or made a references to any phd thesis in my papers except one or two theses about development of software 
 please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself if you believe that there is a reason to keep the redirect you can request that 
 i ended up deleting the page myself 
 i have written over and over that people who argue for more leniency and less restrictions on editors and so on are far more harsh when you ask them about examples like the agf challenge exercises particularly if it is not their own personal hot button issue so be more lenient on me but crack down on everyone else seems to be rule of thumb 
 have a cigar 
 have i argued for more leniency and less restrictions on editors either way im interested but im not sure i know what you are referring to there which restrictions 
 be more lenient on me but crack down on everyone else was the bit i was responding to also i didnt have you in mind 
 sorry i was asking that of filll more than of you im trying to figure out who or where are these wikilove people with whom i have sometimes been associated im still interested in hearing more of your thoughts too on this issue if you will share them 
 please see where you commented previously fred bauder has offered the text of a warning that would be logged in the case see if you agree thanks 
 answered there 
 thanks you dont like freds version do you want to propose a revised warning that case seems likely to sit at ae forever unless it is somehow expedited thanks 
 im in a bid of a bind here i can come up with a general commonsense warning but as i wrote i dont think digwuren stretches this far so i dont know under what authority we should threaten a topic ban 
 btw i do not think tfds behaviour is totally correct for instance i think he should be warned not to misuse the ae tool and finally i agree that the situation when every dispute between easter european users falls under the digwuren case is somewhat odd 
 sorry for posting it here but the ae thread is so complicated that my post could simply be lost there 
 thats what i think he means uN uN 
 i think we have to be open to considering new sorts of approaches and new policies i do not suggest these be implemented wholesale however but in some test cases 
 dont worry filll i dont think anybodys suggesting that you are in favor of biting people or against agf i certainly dont think that about you never have as for your point about those arguing for more leniency and tolerance for letting any editor include whatever they want im pretty sure nobody has argued for that or anything closely approximating it i have certainly never heard it said thirdly nobody here has suggested that you have a problem with representing pseudoscience on wikipedia and i think we are all on the same page that the question is how it sounds as if we are more or less in agreement no 
 by the way an observation your last post begins let me disabuse you of some of those notions and then you dont disagree with anything he said thats interesting of what notion were you disabusing martin one other question what does uncivil mean and how is it different from uncivil 
 huh martin mentioned some editors think that raew editors are unfair uncivil and do too much biteing etc and filll responded with comments about civ and bite etc as for uncivil and uncivil i should think it was obvious uncivil refers to violation of 
 right martin didnt say that filll or anyone else was unfair uncivil biting etc he said that rawe editors perceive others as accusing them of unfairness incivility biting etc im pretty sure filll didnt disagree with that and thats all that martin asserted thus of what notion was filll disabusing martin as for uncivil versus uncivil i guess i do know the difference but i was attempting to remind filll of something i said earlier dont grant your opponents the power to define the language that is a defeatist strategy reclaim the word civility to mean what it really means and join me in saying there is not such thing as a civil violation our civility policy is not a law and its not susceptible of violation if we grant that there is such a thing as a civility violation which we do by using their language then we grant too much lets reclaim the terms of the discussion and stop using fiction words such as uncivil dont even use the allcaps civil it means nothing and if you allow it to mean something you are giving your opponents power hand over fist careful 
 uncivil hurts my eyes and i want it to stop for that reason mostly i think it is reasonable to draw a distinction between 
 it hurts my eyes too whats worse than that is that everytime filll says it hes acknowledging defeat and im not ok with that because i still think he can and should win its the pessimists fallacy granting your opponents the right to define the terms of discourse and im not happy to see people who are essentially right committing that fallacy 
 at issue here is a long term pattern of trolling on lia looveer implying she had nazi sympathies when none of the sources actually state this which in turn encouraged others to engage in similar behaviour turning the article talk page into a 
 im sorry but what i see here is a double standard tfd seems to fairly represent the sources you use one standard to analyse the sources and another to judge his edits i think there is some badfaith interpretation going on here as others have pointed out eastern europe is not one of tfds regular interests so i dont see the evidence for his edits being driven by any eastern european sentiments im very reluctant to overstretch digwuren in that way is 
 the evidence of his sentiment was his statement i dont think i need to point out the odiousness of leveling this kind of sentiment towards wikipedia editors who are representing mainstream sources in good faith evidently tfds statement seems funny to create an article about someone who is interesting because of her connection with colorful characters then remove all the references in 
 hi orderinchaos you recently said in another post wikipedias consensus procedure holds that in order to add something contentious to a contested page one has to obtain consensus on the talk page first does it really say that just curious id be interested to know if that is the case regards 
 technically no it is not covered by 
 i guess i wonder if that is the less dramatic route or the most dramafilled route of all a few wikipedians seem to feel that editors must ask permission before posting new material and they feel they are obeying wikipedia rules by instantly reverting it by hovering over the article and instantly reverting that content it relieves the deleting editor of the need to justify that deletion on the talk page as the revert is a more powerful tool that talk maybe wikipedia rules need to more explicitly define the situations when reverting is acceptable but i question whether instant deletions reduce drama or should be encouraged when it comes to whole article deletions when there is no consensus or if there is doubt the article is kept shouldnt that also apply to paragraph deletions 
 its not a must because it isnt in policy however in this case we had an edit which was poorly justified in terms of 
 im honestly not sure what the next step would be but its got to stop im getting very sick of seeing asshole every other post on that page and you certainly dont deserve that treatment rfc is 
 personally i think a previous suggestion made on the talk page was probably the best onejust ignore him until he decides to calm down and debate rationally and without needing to call names once he realizes no one is listening he will either back off the subject for a while or realize that moderating his tone will make people a lot more likely to listen 
 well you best keep editing there else i will be along to drag you back in all seriousness though if you wish to do an rfc i would back you on it i just prefer to exhaust any other possible solutions before going to that extent one way or the other though it needs to stop im not sure why you have so especially gotten the abuse but from everything i have seen you have made every effort to be reasonable 
 yow i see that it seems to have settled for now if it starts up again rfc may be the next step heres hoping it doesnt come to that 
 thanks added my other two cents to the banner discussion purview or breadth equally work for me 
 hi when i created the above article it brought up a link to your dl page for banff this may not be as odd as it seems as i have not found his death recorded in england so it is quite possible he retired to his native scotland any answers regards 
 many thanks i found a reference linking the brewer to barrow and hence banff so it is the same person regards 
 was his shropshire hime brereton or brocton i do not recall a brereton in shropshire it could be that is a misreading 
 adulteries with two successive wives would certainly be extraordinary if you have a good reference for the duel please add it there are several reports of the case on the internet but all on sites to which i have no access these will be better than the seconsary source currently cited i am not planning to do more on the article so over to you 
 this message is being sent to you because you have previously edited the 
 commented there i think a proper 
 also dont know if you noticed the discussion on talk where i presented a comparison of spade and notspade in the context of strategy shoemaker thought it should be added to notspade and i tried to fit it in earlier but i couldnt find a way to make it work i was thinking maybe rather than adding to notspade i could create a new essay called strategic editing or assertive editing i still think that theres a lot of misunderstanding about notspade shoemakers initial comments are indicative of that misunderstanding and could use further clarification to sway the battleweary any thoughts 
 yes indeed a lot has gone on at that essay this last weekend and i have comments about a lot of it i very much appreciate your posts in that thread and i agree that you are articulating the intended message of nospade very well i agree that shoemaker seemed to get the wrong idea about that essay but that means someone else could come to the same misunderstanding so we might as well improve the page to make such errors less likely the duck business i dont know after some discussion over at spade i came to the idea that the if it walks like a duck adage just doesnt hybridize too well with the ugly duckling story if you put it back i certainly wont fight over it i need to drive from this computer to another one across town but then i will add some comments on the talk page there thanks for the note 
 i see you are a veteran of the climate change arbitration so im wondering if i could get your opinion on a related matter this regards 
 for a little more background stephan you might check out in which will brings up the forbidden topic even though it doesnt have anything to do with that particular ongoing discussion on the lede will do you have a particular reason for asking this question of this editor 
 yes i do have a reason for asking this question of stephan schulz id like to get his answer yours too and nbsp 
 personally i find it absurd to have a large and largely unrelated topic fall under the climate change regime just because some aspects of the topic fall under it in such cases i would only apply the ruling to the aspects that directly deal with climate change however i have seen editors take a different stance i think how the arbcom decision is interpreted in individual cases is unpredictable and likely depends on whether the people dealing with the situation have a prejudiced opinion of the editors involved and if the editors involved show other signs of competence and independent thought an unpopular or informed pov undesirable behavior 
 thanks for the prompt reply im not sure i get the full reply though clearly the larouche movement is an energetic proponent of the contrarian climate change view its not unrelated at all do you deny that involvement of the larouche movement in the climate change controversy and nbsp 
 no not at all but the larouche movement also does many things not related to climate change at all consider eg their peculiar stance on classical and modern music i dont think an editor barred from discussing climate change should be barred from the discussion of other aspects of larouche however i also note that this position is not universally shared 
 on the other hand raising in issue on a talk page where the issue is of 
 what is of minimal importance to an article or what the cc arbcom result was intended for are points that can be legitimately discussed from a pragmatic point i would suggest that editors banned from a topic should avoid it anywhere but need not avoid all pages where it occurs in this particular case and in my opinion claN should refrain from participating in the discussion on how to reflect climate change in the the larouche articles but should feel free to deal with other parts of the topic however as said above im not under the delusion that my opinion is universally shared 
 hey can you unprotect the

 im preparing a 
 hi brad i need to think about this a bit im fairly busy right now and will also be traveling a lot over the next few weeks so im not very keen to become involved in a formal 
 commented there 
 the correct reference is 
 yes we are obviously not communicating and the nonapology you left on my talk page and the message you posted on rauls page further escalating the misunderstanding certainly havent improved the situation funny thing i was thinking all morning about how to find a way to understand each other and was considering a conciliatory post on rauls page to try to get back to a place where we can discuss the issues but after reading what you wrote today im in no mood for it i dont understand how it is that my answers to your questions p###ed you off so much i thought the questions were asked in good faith and my answers were in good faith i think civility while important in some sense is a red herring when it comes to fixing whats wrong with the project as the real problems are npov and rs and incivility cant be treated in isolation i dont understand why that opinion would make you so angry im very serious about not sticking around without some assurance that npov and rs will be enforced by the community i dont understand why in our conversations you keep hammering on that same nail since incivility isnt an issue i have i would like some help with that some assurance that if i did take on those articles that someone would back me up on npov and rs but when i raise these concerns all you can offer is to keep saying over and over that incivility isnt helpful well yes i know that i agree with that but how to proceed is the question but at this point you are the last person i would turn to for help in that effort i will say that im very sorry to have angered you but still dont really understand your anger you did ask the questions after all i can only guess its a matter of personal styles you just dont like my communication style dont understand it that would be too bad but probably not fixable 
 we obviously have very different ideas about what would make wikipedia a tolerable working environment and a successful encyclopedia but since im leaving the field i doubt theres any useful purpose in our continuing to debate the question the one last thing i intend to do is to write an exit essay for the folks at the expert withdrawal page i admire their tenacity stamina and commitment to the project i sympathize with their situation but have no taste for fighting windmills and so wont be joining in their effort to try to slow the inexorable and ongoing downward spiral of wikipedia into nonsense and misinformation i wont say my brief venture into the wikipedia has been fun or enjoyable but its been most enlightening 
 hah good one i know 
 check the computing ref desk for further comment i regularly use powerpoint and keynote and keynote is a lot less painful overall 
 havent used either but note that 
 im always struck by of course in that case its probably not primarily the tool and its hard to make such presentations and to use them effectively 
 hi i suggested to ebanony and rjensen that they first get the article tj and slavery edited to their satisfaction then bring the collaboration back to that summary section in the tj article they agreed so most of the discussion on that topic should now be at the associated article if you are still interested 
 thanks i am and will take a look but im somewhat busy and an american controversy is still next on my reading list 
 perhaps related to this gtbacchus i agree with the sentiments you expressed on the expelled talk page but if you could stay and teach by example and actually show how you deal with povpushers rather than lecturing filll on how he should do it i would be more appreciative maybe filll too sorry if this seems rude but i think one should show some respect to those people who are doing the hard work im not saying you are not doing hard work elsewhere but you just jumped into one of the most controversial articles on the wiki and instead of helping out you lectured one of the editors who is working on that article since its beginnings on how to behave you must understand the frustration or 
 that is vaguely related to about N percent of it but this is not the time 
 well N per cent is just about N per cent better than my average my acuteness in sensing what bothers people is improving 
 merzul i think your observations are good if this were my first interaction with filll i would certainly not have said what i said however this is the nth stop on a long series of interactions we have had filll in my observation has a history and pattern of including unnecessary and inflammatory personal remarks in posts that should be about content that was a great example of why its foolish to do that and i pointed it out maybe fillls talk page would have been a better place to do so but when i observe counterproductive behavior that exemplifies a pattern i have already mentioned to the editor i may very well point it out eventually filll may realize that keeping it professional and courteous is in his best interest that will be a good day for the project because he does good work aside from the tendency to disparage others fillls suggesting that i be a bit cautious is mysterious to me because i dont know how im being incautious or what sort of danger im trying to avoid here he can explain that or not as he sees fit 
 i responded on my talk page i will let filll continue here if he wants to explain the why you should be cautious 
 is instructive thanks minor note i could have endorsed several other views but felt that a few was indicative that doesnt matter for a broad overlook though 
 you are welcome i found it hard to get an overall feel for the opinions so i tried to organize the data a bit i should be able to do this algorithmically but the structure was a bit to irregular and signatures are a pain to parse 
 given edit i dont think we have a sufficient base for communication however i do have with science 
 no i just moved it because footnote markers generally go at the end of a sentence rather than in the middle an interested reader can easily read the citation and see what specific part is being referenced uN 
 the chicago manual of style notes that the superior numerals used for note reference numbers in the text should follow any punctuation marks except the dash which they precede as noted 
 i am sorry but i do not feel you have answered the questions i have posted adequately could you please commence in doing so i am genuinely curious as to why you acted in the manner you did may i add that just because you have some experience with science does not prove why removing my words was beneficial or correct 
 editors on the articles 
 if he does not know i am not going to tell him at this point sorry this is not an opportune time 
 ok thanks 
 feel better soon left 
 thank you hopefully it wont affect my editing too much 
 lol i try to stay away from wikipedia toodoesnt work 
 thanks for the agf nudge re the marcus bachman or tarc discussion you were right and i have removed that part of my comment 
 you are welcome 
 critical reception is never used for titles with software only with movies and books i dont know if this is true for example its used for the firefox and opera web browser articles can you send me the link to this titling guideline thanks 
 hello its not a guideline but the same section is titled criticisms for 
 do you agree that all softwarerelated articles should have a critical reaction and criticism section as each are informative to the readers if you do you should propose it to the appropriate place since having it as guideline makes sure everything is kept consistent in the future you say that books and movies mostly use the critical reaction section but the problem is that those articles sometimes note negative points in the same section widespread standardization is needed 
 yes i agree that the two sections are equally useful i dont have the time to develop this more for now because it is very late but i will do tomorrow 
 thank you for your contribution to 
 you are welcome 
 i just read over 
 i think we are not in a hurry and id like to see a more broadbased demonstration of consensus before doing something thats very very likely to be reverted i dont agree with adding the url but im not religious about it we may disagree on that point but i think we both agree that we should take a measured consensusbased approach we are on the policy highground with that position because arbcom has tasked the community with developing a policy solution to precisely this type of situation if the community ends up adopting a principled stance that implies we should host the url or the link then i will support that consensus it isnt however here yet 
 i wish everybody involved in the debate was as reasonable as you i happen to be on opposite sides from you right at the moment on the specific issue of whether the site ought to be linked but you are presenting your arguments from reason instead of blind appeals to authority or emotional outbursts so id have no problem accepting a consensus that went against me if it were made up of people like you 
 thanks dan i dont always succeed at presenting my arguments as you say but i do try in connection to the link we are talking about i would point out that arbcom made a specific exception to the no links to ed ruling for an unlinked url that was on my user page from until that was the closest thing we had to a neutral article on ed for those six months and it didnt cause the sky to fall true i oppose including the link in the article for reasons that are in a state of flux right now but i think theres a big difference the url on my page wasnt going to be used for trolling whereas one in the article is much more likely to be i also hadnt really thought about the legal aspect at that time 
 i have been thinking about that for a while and i decided to take a shot at documenting my thoughts in nospade but i seem to have struck some nerves feel free to edit as you see fit or remove entirely i just figured id try to start getting more of these ideas in concrete form so we can start hacking away at them 
 i like the section its a good idea to address that term as it is being used thanks and thanks for the headsup 
 i just wanted to let you know that if you are watching the situation i would really appreciate your advice 
 please notice that 
 thanks for the information when and if i decide to edit that article i will be acting as an editor not as any kind of puppet thanks for understanding at this time i have no plans to do anything with the above that may change in the future 
 hi gtbacchus just a reminder that you have signed up to attend the seattle meetup this thursday this ones going to take place at N pm at thaiku a restaurantbar in ballard see the 
 if you can point to specific articles i may be able to say something more concrete 
 regarding that source my question is why is the journal archives of surgery not a reliable source in your opinion if someone supporting that source were listening id ask whether its statement of results is the most representative statement we can find of what mainstream studies tend to say or whether its wording is more severe than most comparable studies

 his actions are not 
 thanks for your courteous response at the 
 hi as a mathematics student and teacher i find the math reference desk here to be one of the most useful resources on the internet i have used the desk from both sides both asking and answering although i have been online so infrequently of late that i havent been around when i start a phd program in late august you may be seeing more of me there 
 umm so when you are phdn you will have more time to enlighten the masses im perplexed oh well then whatever your schedule permits i for one enjoy your clarity and persuasiveness you future doctor bacchus you 
 yeah when you put it that way i guess i was thinking i will be more immersed in mathematics other than the highschool classes i have been teaching for which i dont often need the reference desk thanks for the vote of confidence i have been pretty inactive lately partly just due to life and partly due to a series of interactions that gave me a lot to think about i will be surprised though if my participation doesnt pick up soon after all i will have all sorts of gradschool responsibilities to procrastinate and wikipedia is incredibly useful in that regard 
 i was wondering if you could take a look at the page 
 i have made an edit to the article with a comment and i have added the page to my watchlist i will have another look later 
 hey i was hoping you might add your tuppence worth over on the 
 i have replied at the talk page these articles would certainly benefit from some careful attention 
 hey gtbacchus i dont know if you remember me or not but a few months ago you were helping me out with admin coaching well i got busy with school and stuff and had a few months of inactivity from wikipedia well i back on now not a whole lot but doing some editing well i was wondering if you are still interested if we could continue the coaching i might need to get reajusted to what has changed the past months so im up to date anyways i was just wondering if you would like to continue that or not since im back now thanks 
 hi im currently on the road moving from seattle to texas im still happy to coach you but i cant focus on anything but traveling until i get to where im going let me message you then its great to hear from you i hope things are going well 
 that would be great take your time no rush just when you get settled it would be cool if we could continue good luck on your move 
 thanks it took me a few days longer than i expected but i finally made it to north texas it will be a couple of weeks yet before im in any way settled in but watch this space now that im in grad school again i should have lots of important work to procrastinate so i will probably maintain an active presence here again 
 ok i will keep an eye out for updates 
 given your implied permission on your contact page i have posted our 
 yes thats fine and in fact encouraged i was going to post it here but got distracted s 
 thanks for giving me the rollback tool i still prefer twinkle because it gives a more detailed edit summary but rollback is a lot faster later 
 you are welcome 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the 
 i just removed it from the primordial main article because it was not appropriate in the main article i have no opinion on if it must be deleted as a specific article or not considering the amount of work needed to create such a list i thought it was fair to create a new article with it to give time to those who created this content to justify it rather than just deleting it from the main article without warning 
 the term xxxxxborn american almost always means a naturalized american citizen who was born in country xxxxx for a person born to american parents in another country you would just say american and possibly note place of birth 
 i guess it depends what you mean when you say austrian his background is austrian his childrens background is halfaustrian but hes american think of another example if an actor is born in toronto then moves to hollywood and eventually takes out american citizenship hes no longer canadian hes a canadianborn american 
 this can also be applied to 
 hmm as far as i know every prepositional phrase is either an adjective or an adverb rather than argue about it at all id like to see a reference to an accepted grammatical source or style guide on this topic its my experience that grammar aficionados trying to convince one another of anything is pretty useless unless one considers it fun i do not

 i think if one spends a lot of time doing adminish stuff or even just plain maintenance that doesnt need the mop bit then iar is likely to be quite a bit more relevant people havent necessarily considered every little possibility and just going ahead and doing the right thing is often more appropriate and mdash 
 i hope you do not assume that i am somehow sheltered from articlespace disputes quite the contrary i am regularly involved in such questions albeit more often as a referee than as a participant i find iar to be alive and well in content disputes you dont need to explain to me how they go because i have been around that block many times it is true that many people read our policies and guidelines as rules that must be followed this is a problem and it hurts the project however if someone quotes wpweirdrule and someone else points out that here is some good reason to ignore wpweirdrule then in my experience the appropriate conversation happens and anyone suggesting that rules are somehow fully binding finds out that they are mistaken i find that people are pretty good at understanding that the written rules are distillations of good ideas that people have had and that they are always negotiable on a casebycase basis i see wpiar cited regularly and correctly and it is taken seriously when the application makes sense if you like i can point it out to you the next time i see it happen in a content dispute it is not always explicitly cited and i can see how someone thinking in terms of rules would not recognize a valid application of iar without an explicit citation one thing you have written above disturbs me any particular detail or loophole in the wording is taken as is since theres no other basis for establishing consensus that is neither my experience nor is it acceptable the absolutely is another basis for establishing consensus namely reasoned discourse good reasons trump rules rightly and regularly the idea that an imagined loophole should carry more weight than a wellreasoned argument is shockingly wrong the core content policies 
 well you seem quite wellconvinced that i dont really know what content disputes are like i will just let you believe what you wish have a nice day 
 this doesnt fall under aN i suggest you reread the speedy deletion criteria aN applies to real people groups of people or web content not madeup musical genres i have removed the tag it will go with the prod otherwise it will find itself deleted at afd theres no hurry 
 it was unfortunatly the best i could get with 
 as you were the creator of these articles id just like to inform you that they are up for deletion i have not been able to add my comments as i am currently busy but i just thought id let you know in case you would want to contribute to the discussion thanks 
 just letting you know that i have put my comments down in the deletion discussion apart from my comments and the nomination of deletion itself no one else has added any comments to the discussion regards 
 the was no consensus thanks for your input 
 i just wanted to say i changed back the 
 no worries i only changed it because it was a doubleredirect at the time thanks for letting me know 
 hi i noticed that you had wikify chris westphal as a task so i did it that page still needs some cleaning up but the wikification is done

 i am editing an article about 
 hi i have looked at the article and made a few minor wikifying edits i have also read the talk page and scanned the history i havent yet looked at the sources or at the edits in detail im just posting to let you know that i am having a look into the situation my initial impression is that there are really only the two of you involved so i think seeking outside eyes is a great step to have taken the notability issues are likely to echo many previous notability discussions so finding people who have worked with a lot of those might be a good way to avoid repeating past conflicts and misunderstandings such people can probably be found at 
 one very weak part of the article imo is a frank discussion of the illness naming debate within the patient groups the researchers and clinicians in various parts of the world the politics of the name is a large factor in what medical research groups get funding its very polarized in real life and of course polarized in editing the article but the article itself only lightly describes the differing views some reasonable talk page discussion on the name is here thanks for looking

 hi there i noticed you are a member of 
 your last comment there was really unhelpful take a look at what the ip has been trying to force into the article 
 reminding editors to stay ontopic does not seem unhelpful to me is there a question in that afd that is being decided for anything but sourcebased reasons how is straying from that topic helpful 
 he made ludicrous accusations and i responded saying get a room was the part i considered particularly unhelpful as i said take a look at what that ip has been trying to force into the article 
 yeah by responding to those accusations you prolonged an offtopic irrelevant conversation using the forum of an afd discussion to engage in personal disputes thats inappropriate hence get a room if you really want to pursue the topic of what that ip thinks your bias is take it to user talk the correct way to deal with an editor like that is to arefuse to be dragged offtopic there is nothing relevant in an afd discussion other than the existence of nontrivial coverage in multiple independent reliable sources red herrings are not to be chased thats if you want afd to work properly 
 please read my latest addition 
 i cant deal with the overlinking and lawyering from jenkins anymore gtb i meant it when i said that was my last post to those pages i mean he pointed me to something called popularpages because i dared point out that all three have N + google news hits i feel like a headshewinstailsilose scenario is being constructed by him there and i dont have the patience for it good luck to you and again i apologize for taking out my frustrations on you initially 
 no worries about earlier i understand that it can be very frustrating to collaborate with someone who plays pedant with the supposed rule book (as original writer and sometime editor of 
 now biruitol thinks perhaps a good suggestion might be to just iar and delete it and the ip guy is still attacking at the gokey talkpage sigh 
 i wouldnt worry about anyone ignoring all rules with this one its likely to be decided more or less by the book on a related note you might want to think about not letting arguments here get to you too personally eventually we will probably have a wellsourced article on whatshisname and any delays in the meanwhile arent going to take away anyones life or liberty your desire to improve the wikipedia is great but you dont want to let this project cut into your enjoyment of life there are some good tricks for dealing with vexatious editors that you might look into best of luck to you 
 i just now realized that within minutes after i recommended keeping the gokey article the above user went to my userpage and clicked through the six articles i created until he found a stub (
 huh you seem to take a real crime or punishment view of what goes on here i really dont if someone is a jerk the best reaction isnt to tell on them or to try to get them censured in some way its to just set an example by being better im the last guy you should be asking to topicban someone all im going to do is advocate that you learn how to work with them because ultimately you cant topicban them all 
 not crime and punishment rather a hope that those who treat the project as some kind of battleground and act subversively would not be allowed to simply slide along treating others so poorly i apologize for wasting your time 
 im sorry that you take my position as allowing someone to slide along thats not what im talking about i wish you luck 
 he clearly created an afd in retaliation not even bothering to inform me that he was afding an article i created you made it sound like i was doing something wrong by letting you know about his disruption and made it clear you werent going to be even discussing the issue with him that at least seems like letting the guy slide along to me i have no idea what to make of this whole experience 
 whats the great harm in an afd if the article is worth keeping then it wont be deleted and thats fine right theres no point in me discussing it with him no rule says you have to inform an articles author if you take an article to afd it may be an obnoxious thing he did but what do you want me to do spank him for it just go to the afd and calmly explain why the article should be kept and then carry on with whatever other editing you are doing i dont mean to make it sound as if you are doing something wrong i just know that theres no point it trying to get justice here this isnt court its an encyclopedia being a jerk is eventually its own punishment hes gonna have to lie in the bed that he makes dont sweat it 
 its already been kept but the principle of the thing really bothers me i guess i just thought it was a rule of some sort that if you nominate an article for deletion you inform the creator and any significant contributors am i really wrong about that if so how does one go about changing the policy regarding afds in that way 
 informing the creator and major contributors is very courteous and is a great idea many people do it you are very unlikely to convince wikipedians to create a rule about it a huge amount of site culture exists against that sort of thing what you might not realize is that wikipedia explicitly does not function according to rule of law this surprises the hell out of some people its very anarchic and the most ridiculous thing about it is that it works please read 
 oh but to answer your question 
 thanks for the advice and the links i dont think i was trying to appeal to rules at all i was simply trying to understand how an open culture could let someone be so disruptive as to afd an article simply because of who created it there do seem to be rules here especially against disruption unless im seriously misunderstanding the nature of protecting and blocking 
 yeah i agree its weird the only rule is good encyclopedia everything else either falls into line under that or else its vapor lots of things that look just like rules are really just conventions written down because they work most of the time eventually though working is more important than being written down there are certainly disruptions that must be prevented in the name of maintaining a good encyclopedia and we will do what it takes to prevent them spurious afds arent so bad unless it becomes a pattern and then people start to notice and something gets done that last one he started about the scottish band will be 
 i just checked into that one and it is a rather poor nomination i just made a speedy keep recommendation 
 thanks for the publication stub tag i was wondering where to find that 
 no problem 
 the name is more primary wow where do you get that from on what do you base your argument that a nonexistent article about a name is more primary than an article about a town even if there was a featured article about the name i dare say it would be rarely linked to 
 i base it on the arguments made in the discussion as i said i certainly didnt see consensus for a move nor do i see your reading of the guidelines to be unequivocal if you disagree with my decision i suggest taking the question to a wider audience if it becomes clear that i made a bad call i will accept that 
 i agree that there was no consensus for a move and im satisfied with it at georgina ontario i could have been convinced that 
 well if it doesnt make any practical difference im certainly willing to agree that i didnt articulate my reading of the argument very well i think georgina is used a lot more as a womans name than as the name of a town in ontario thats different from paris despite miss hiltons popularity it might be more accurate to say that there is no primary usage because the use as a name isnt really singular but many usages taken together at any rate 
 thats the thing there may be many people who have the name georgina but none who are named simply georgina and so would not be linked there it is preposterous in my opinion to add up the number of people who have the name in their name and say that thus the town is not the primary meaning when it is in fact the only article named georgina i would have changed my opinion on the move if anyone could have told me that an article about the name could be created but no one did despite my requests im not that surprised i doubt that there are sources to create an article about the name the substub created should be honestly deleted but i will leave it in the hope that someone may create the article some day anyway 
 i understand your point here adding up the uses of the name doesnt make sense i guess its kind of a lazy way of saying that the town may be the only thing truly called georgina but it has so little individual weight that it makes sense to declare no primary use if we were talking in the abstract itd be one thing but i dont think a simple plurality is enough to warrant primary use status complete w or redirect i think more readers will be served by the dab page 
 i forgot to say that 
 which i guess makes this kind of a moot point but you are right to point out that the rationale i typed wasnt very clear im happier as a writer with what i have typed above i think my instinct knew it at the time better than my words did 
 its true that its moot and it appears we dont disagree much i am just concerned about precedents and clear arguments i would have not participated so much in the move debate had not the original objections simply been of the sort i have never heard of the town but i know some people have that first name im glad that you took the took the time to answer my questions and you have relieved my concerns somewhat about your closure cheers 
 and what did you mean by it is false that editors are required to argue from policy only and not introduce external reasons was this related to the story of the guy getting lost on the way to the girlfriends motel 
 that was a direct reaction to mindmatrixs statement if you disagree with current policy then discuss it at the relevant policy pages not here discussion on this page should reflect current policy not personal opinion if you disagree with my analysis please explain why based on current policy hes incorrect to argue that way thats the opposite of how wikipedia works general policies are determined by decisions made on a casebycase basis not the other way around

 thanks 
 glad to know that issue was resolved i was actually stunned that the article was nominated good to know there was indeed some hidden nefariousness going on next stop for me are the spi results themselves should make for entertaining reading 
 anonymous edits is that what vandalism means now on wp i didnt think so 
 man you should read 
 shakespearefanN s tagging of your images was entirely valid they are lacking in a 
 i accept the apology and i am sure shakespearefanN will too i understand that editing can get frustrating at times i recommend should you wish for the images to be kept you provide a fair use rationale yes i have the power to block users i am an 
 i agree with moving it if someone demonstrates a more commonly used name in english we will start a new discussion 
 thats taken care of now 
 according to it is 
 you know the people who work on these radio station articles are quite consistent and these requests cross through the uncontroversial proposals desk without any trouble if you disagree with the way they are handling the naming of radio station articles i suggest you take it up at the project talk page arguing it out over particular articles is pointless because we are talking about a general practice here for now im gonna trust 
 i look forward to reading your response which will i am certain be wellworded and cogentlyreasoned 
 i was taking some time to think on this issue and just wondering if it was really necessary to remove the hook even for some other reason when several people had already expressed their opinions that such removals were disruptive dont you think that it was an inappropriate time for that you could have started a discussion on the project talk page first 
 i may have misunderstood the purpose of preparation areas my understanding was that they were for experimenting with layout and sequence and identifying lastminute mistakes is this correct or incorrect 
 im very sure lovejoy is an irishman however i will have to check the deleted scenes considering i recall that is where his nationality is stated if i am incorrect do accept my apology 
 like i said his nationality is stated in a deleted scene 
 im unsure of youtube but i will check the dvd besides accents is an area of historical accuracy that doesnt matter and in all honesty warner sounds irish to me he sounds a bit like 
 hi i had a question about content from 
 ah thats a good catch you are absolutely right that we will need to rewrite that section from sources so its got a visible history i will pull it out of the article now and start a talk page section thanks for bringing this to my attention 
 thanks for your responsiveness i have inserted a rather dry rewrite 
 i think you would be interested in this ongoing dispute at wolfberry you will see badagnanis hyper disruptive manner and usage of unreliable sources 
 have you considered a 
 hmm let me tell something for your information when he was numerously attacked by korean editors for his erroneous edits to korean cuisine articles i was once a defender of him for a while because he is a rare editor interested in korean cuisine regardless of what intention he has but well things got sour after i have seen too many cases of his erroneous edits or original research or wikistalking or attacks several people declared to him or her to file a rfc or u but it did not occur 
 i have to go away for a few hours now but i want to reply to this post i will get back to you after i do some mathematics 
 do you think you can keep cool in a discussion even if somebody has attacked you for a long time im sorry but i just a human unable to tolerate his behaviors or editing 
 in fact i dont think the discussion is no longer necessary because he cant prove any evidence that the linking is allowed to here that kind of arguing is very familiar to meN N march N 
 you are right keeping cool under fire is difficult many worthwhile things are difficult the most worthwhile things are nearly impossible when you give in to frustration and express your anger towards another editor it undermines your effectiveness im sorry thats true but its true i am ready to help you a lot to deal with this editor however the only way i can help you is by teaching you effective strategies and the first lesson is that you will never be effective while allowing yourself to stray into personal comments i didnt make that true but its true editors such as badagnani who seems tendentious can be dealt with effectively let me show you how let me help you as for whether the discussion is necessary dont underestimate the value of getting the arguments into clear focused text on the talk page the discussion may not be necessary for you or for him or for me but we are not the intended audience the people we need to communicate with are the next N editors who come along they have to be able to separate the important relevant sourcebased arguments from the personal conflict your job is to make that easy for them by omitting all personal content explaining the sourcebased and policybased arguments in a focused way and maintaining an extreme level of professionalism courtesy and focus thus making outsiders want to take your side if you are seen as the gentleman and hes making racist remarks they are almost certain to agree with you they will revert for you more likely if you refrain from reverting on principle once you are both reverting and once accusations start going both ways very many outsiders will simply see you both as part of a viper pit of povwarriors the truth wont matter their perceptions will matter entirely think about those perceptions every time you post 
 thank you for the calm and helpful advice and time that you have spent for this dispute as i read through your advice my stirred mind is getting settled you are right if i do the same behavior that he does to editors people might group me together with him and i dont want that i will heed and keep it in mind 
 for your work on 
 no problem cheers 
 thank you for your comment which i believe to be based on a fundamental misreading of our guidelines the link is essential to the article and removing it plays into the highly disruptive and unceasing efforts of koreannationalist pov editors we should not encourage the behavior of nationalistpov editors of any nation 
 gtbacchus i will sincerely reconsider your suggestion given this repeated racist attacks regardless of your effort to put down the fire 
 for its really appreciated 
 you are welcome 
 i believe to a discussion over the dio disambigution redirect is incorrect i have read through the section several times in the early part their was some dicrepency over which article was the primary topic and a few editors voted to support the change simply because they saw that ther was debate and careful reading of all the supports show that there was not really a consensus amongst them as to why they voted support and if you review the oppose votes you can see a clear consensus among all of them as to why they voted that way yes the overall vote was a near tie with only N extra oppose vote in the tally with N or N oppose votes all with the same reasoning that wikipedia statistics for page reads clearly show that dio was wiki readers primary topic an overwhelming victory at that a pint was made in the debate that if readers were going to dio but not wanting the page they ended up at they would click the other uses link and move on to their intended target but the page counts clearly show that this was never the case and that dio was their intended target note that administrator prolog was one of the oppose votes with a reason that matched all the other oppose votes some of the other oppose votes even quote per prolog both in the vote section and in the earlier discussion when prolog posted his first comments on the redirect question there my N whine fest is done for the day hope i didnt waste too much of your time but i did want to point out my concern i have been a regular editor for N years losing the odd debate doesnt make me lose too much sleep sniff sob d have a nice day take care 
 i knew it was going to be a controversial close either way the argument that i found most persuasive was the fact that if you search google books or google scholar then the band drops way down the list and dio chrysostom shoots way up to the top simply counting google hits is one thing but if you restrict your search to sources that are more encyclopedic then you get a very different picture that said the title you gave to this section is question but its not clear to me what your question is if theres something you want me to answer please let me know and i will do my best to do so im also going to post at 
 thanks and you are right comment or concern would have been a better choice of section hdr now after the fact my hidden question was could you explain your decision a little further which you have now done so again thanks and take care 
 have a great first edit day 
 thank you all and mdash
 by the way see 
 you will find that i dont think of wikipedia in terms of rules i authored the original version of 
 thats a very useful answer thanks to my mind if we cant work something out here it will be a continuation of whats been going on for a long time i just think an npov tag would help readers understand that they should be on their guard and take everything with an extra grain of salt the hideandshow thing is probably worth considering further maybe it would be less objectionable if its put in an infobox anyway im past my bedtime gnight 
 im not very good at writing code can you please check 
 all fixed 
 so do you think is ready for prime time 
 you want to use it as the top picture 
 for several reasons first guidelines allow hide and show for infoboxes and say that hide and show is not acceptable elsewhere due to accessability readability and printing second i dont know how to write code for elsewhere in the article and third using hide and show will make the thing relatively small and unobtrusive even at the top of the article i would obviously prefer to not use hide and show at all in which case the image could go where it was proposed lower in the article but this seems like a reasonable compromise for the time being what do you think 
 i really dont like the idea that the hide or show rule is absolute i know what the argument for it is but that doesnt make it absolute these things are not laws and they are not meant to be interpreted technically the coding thing is clearly not a problem because we are surrounded by people who know that code why dont you post a link at the talk page and see what other people think 
 there are also other reasons for doing it in the infobox for example 
 fair enough regarding infoboxes i dont actually know whats going on with that rule because theres something technical about infoboxes that make it make sense if i understood that i could say something more intelligent the jargon issue could be resolved most simply with words i suspect i think finding someone who is willing to immediately code up a hide or show box on wikipedia is a roughly N second task id be perfectly happy to do that legwork and get them to teach me about it at the same time even so i dont think we are in a hurry are we im certainly willing to take the idea to the talk page 
 incidentally i have tried to resolve the jargon issue with words to no avail 
 yes i was just reading about that now 
 thanks we will see how it goes 
 splash i think it is very wise to protect the user box because of the edit war however i do think that it is not enough the protection leaves the template in the shortterm version of the last editor who was only lucky enough to be the last editor and now sees his warmongering rewarded with a longterm version how unjust the best thing to do is to protect it and revert it back to the last version before the editwar so you know it is in the longterm version its users accepted it also protects you against false accusations of being partisan and abusing protection in order to push through a pov which is then falsely presented as yours 
 i dont think i need to be concerned about false accusations particularly theyd be false after all 
 hi i noticed you and a couple other users have been having a minor dispute since october on the kazuya mishima article anyway theres no biological or affinitive connection between kazuya and asuka this may vary depending on culture or different lines of thinking but impregnating jun alone doesnt necessarily create a relational bond between kazuya and the rest of the kazama family trying to draw that connection is a very moot point and ultimately adds nothing to the article 
 i understand perfectly well what you are telling me and i respect your opinion but as far as i know kazuya is the father of jin kazama so if asuka kazama is jins cousin it would make kazuya into a relative of the kazama family since kazuyas blood is in jin 
 its just a coincidence as several editors at several different pages have begun engaging in very insistent campaigns of blanking always refusing to discuss in a thoughtful or collegial manner beforehand pointing such behavior out and maintaining the request that they do out of consideration for other editors and the community discuss prior to making such large deletions certainly does not involve attacking another editor simply pointing out the behavior and requesting again and again that they moderate their behavior thank you for your personal interest in me as an editor however 
 yeah telling editors that they are breaking rules almost never helps a situation if you have trouble with people deleting material against consensus why dont you tell me where the problem is and maybe i can help out it is generally a good strategy to bring outside parties to a dispute and let more eyes see the problem 
 its not necessary to mention that leo is pursuing him for revenge within kazuyas story for one that has nothing to do with kazuyas story second its already mentioned in the rivals section third if someone wants to understand the how and why of it they can just real leos article remember that to improve the quality of the articles we should omit unnecessary details and keep things as brief as they need to be thank you 
 thank you i was trying to avoid an edit war and not seem as though i were picking on you all the time thanks for understanding 
 i do still think that you are a nice and kind person but i have had a question regarding your objectivity compared to your comment toward bulldogN your advices to badagnani are too soft although you said you warned him enough you explained that unless your goal is become a jerk is just a literal meaning but that sounds to me bulldogN you are currently acting like a jerk you can accuse me not to assume good faith on him but well just hit me (i have to not feed the user with agf any more 
 i absolutely have never accused you of failing to agf i havent even mentioned it my insistence that there is a better approach has nothing to do with agf and everything to do with dry cold pragmatics pragmatically you win more by making fewer accusations counterintuitive but true forget agf you are here to win win by being pragmatic you disagree with my approach to badagnani but that has nothing to do with my objectivity my expectations vary from person to person in accordance with what i have seen of them i strongly suspect that badagnani hasnt got much time left on wikipedia and you will note that you already have my support at the rfc convincing badagnani to change requires that someone extend a hand to him im willing to be that hand it may be a oneinamillion shot and i wont complain if he gets banned before he hears a damn word i say but im going to extend that hand partly im just an optimist partly im also trying to lead by example and show that in the long run the only effective weapon against tendentious editors is unfailing professionalism and smart dispute resolution partly its helpful to have someone playing 
 sorry for my rhetoric comment toward you i misjudged you i dont know actually the rfc would get some positive effects to him i have to face him in korean cuisine or culture articles so forth so i hope something good comes out 
 have you so much as read 
 i will not respond to as i believe you wish me not to respond when editors attempting to remove me from wikipedia follow me to pages they had not previously edited kindly advise will not responding ensure such following does not continue 
 badagnani you are being very funny with another false accusation im a member of 
 caspian as there are many articles on wikipedia it seems very provocative to choose to work on an article on which you havent edited previously where badagnani is involved i accept that you saw it on a discussion page but if you are engaged in an rfc against an editor surely doing your best to avoid working on articles with them makes more sense than engaging them in a new and unnecessary dispute 
 childofmidnigh as long as you overly defend the disruptive editor you dont get my respect much perhaps you can instead explain his arecent hounding of my newly created articles (
 i suggested avoidance where reasonable seems like a good idea which i dont think is equivalent to defending him i havent looked at those diffs and i dont really want to but i think you should both try to leave each other alone as much as possible 
 then the solution would be very simple he stops the habit of wikistalking me first i stop caring his disruption happening somewhere unless that comes into my turfN N march N 
 hey guys if you are not talking to me please take the conversation elsewhere thanks caspian i look forward to seeing how you practice deescalation with badagnani any other approach outside of the regular dispute resolution process would not be very helpful 
 you are right gtbacchus this is your talk page so midnight should have left the message on my talk page and i should have replied that (
 that may be caspian but neither you nor i controls badagnani deescalation is the responsibility of whoever decides to be responsible theres a situation and an opportunity to make it better take that or dont learn how to better handle people like badagnani and your whole life will improve we are working on badagnani in the rfc working on your own reactions to hostile editors is your job 
 please stop inserting needless plot summary into this article there is a concentrated effort to remove such content discuss the issue in the talk page if you feel this is wrong 
 you did it again in 
 i was finally to get a hold of that book about the calendar art as well as another book and will see about finishing the pop culture section over the weekend uN buN buN buN buN buN buN buN b 
 whats the thinking behind edits like you seem to have done this systematically for all the indies or altsrocks but i cant puzzle out why 
 no problem just wanted to check i wasnt missing something vital as it occurred to me halfway through changing them back probably looks bad to rfa someone and then get into an edit war with them 
 yeah i know what you mean probably takes me about that long on average to notice edits to stub types i have created even if they are on my watchlist i dont want to hurry to close those for the very reason that i was the nominator in one case and the person arguing loud and long for deletion in the other perhaps you could suggest an admin huddle on 
 i feel your pain i really do 
 should we remove the other image as well with fr and bush or is that more necessary 
 most of the section is about his relationship with bush also sandwiching text between two images should be avoided per 
 i have reverted your edit attempting to add pov material to the plot section of this article and explain the reasoning behind it please do not continue to add it without participating in a discussion thanks 
 to answer your edit summary the final flashback is factual yes i happen to think the sentence is more effective without it included but i wont revert 
 thank you kindly for this thoughtful response in the past few moments i seem to have been followed to several more articles with editors again somehow newly discovering many articles i have created in all cases attempting to remove text or delete the article entirely rather than building on or supporting my edits the thing is i thought this was not permitted now that i am not permitted to point out such behavior and the editors doing this are never asked to stop i wonder how i should proceed in such a case do you see that this leads to a lack of a teamwork and collaborative spirit i feel very strongly about maintaining 
 i wouldnt say that you are not permitted to point out difficult behavior i would say that pointing it out directly to the person via an accusation or warning is a terrible idea because it makes the situation worse not better thats unless you can warn someone so tactfully that they accept your criticism and take it as a friendly note at that point you are a true diplomat and i have nothing more to tell you the best thing to do is to treat each dispute as a content dispute in those terms you can ask others to look and then trust that people will notice behavior patterns if you are consistently the one talking patiently about edits and someone else is consistently the one making personal remarks then you will end up obtaining more support and whoever is making personal attacks will just look bad now if you can point me to an article where a conflict is happening i will have a look at it and probably weigh in with some opinion if you do this a few times and we start to notice that the same editor is making spurious arguments about your contributions then we can look at addressing that behavior issue we cant address the behavior issue though until we can separate it from the content dispute and that cant happen unless someone focuses on the content so which article are you thinking of pick any one 
 thank you very much i thought however that following another editor to many articles is not permittedthe policy page i just read about this (
 badagnani you need to stop worrying about that stop talking about that and let the process work you will never win until you put N per cent of your energy to edits and N per cent to personal stuff forget those policies and edit with me we will take care of the bad behavior dont worry be calm be patient and talk to me about liqueurs 
 is wp policy not important i thought you were a trusted and evenhanded administrator what shall i do if you do not wish to assist in an evenhanded manner i thought you were from your previous messages to me but now you tell me not to worry about wp policy to forget about this policy i cannot forget about this policy because it is hampering the efforts of one of the most productive wp editors i dont know what to do 
 wikipedia policy is important however there is a necessity to work effectively dealing with the behavior policies as you have been doing is not effective in fact it is very counterproductive and it can get people banned if you just trust me a little bit and watch how i enforce behavior policies i think you might be surprised i need you to help me do it though by doing as i suggest please trust me you can be a much more productive editor if you learn some better conflict skills will you at least give me a chance to show you 
 however i have been reported things must be evenhanded or wikipedia cannot function effectively i was under the impression that our admins were evenhanded and did place great value in our policies 
 you must not have noticed that i have been responding to those who report you in precisely the same way i have been responding to you if thats not evenhanded what both sides of the dispute need to realize is that we have got two choices we either talk about each other or we talk about edits if we are here to talk about each other then the project means nothing also recall that an rfc is not a formal report of any kind its a group of people making comments what im trying to do is to help aresolve the problematic relations but that can only be done in the venue of talking about edits please talk to me about edits badagnani please show me how you collaborate already if you trust me the behavior part will follow naturally and you will see the policies enforced okay 
 badagnani be calm the content wont go far and people wont die as a result of not knowing about some brand of liqueur i strongly suggest that you make note of the content that is missing help me put together your case like i have been trying to get you to do and focus on one article please can we do that this is how you will win trust me you have to slow down and focus in order to win can you do that 
 mongo if you have any local refs for this critter would be really good to input once this one is u to fa then there is a wild cats of north america ft in the making with 
 i will see what i can come up with 
 great there are hardly any fts and this is the closest candidatecheers 
 thank you for your message i am a longtime editor and am very familiar with our policies and how we handle references and external links your question implies that i am not which comes as a surprise to me i have responded in the appropriate location in response to your query i have not received an answer regarding our policy of wikihounding after having asked about it four or five times now may i gather that you do not enforce this policy for example you have not even queried the editor doing this even once while you have sent me many messages pointing out problems you feel i display i had thought from your earlier communications that you were an evenhanded admin is this not the case i thought all our admins applied our policies in an evenhanded manner 
 i enforce the wikihounding once it is clear to me exactly whats going on you are not making it very easy for me to figure that out because instead of presenting me with the information that i can use to defend you you avoid my questions it makes enforcement very difficult when you seem to expect that i will do it blindly without looking into the situation i draw my own judgements as to when someone is being wikihounded i thank you in advance for respecting my ability to do that and for providing clearer answers to my attempts to gather information 
 i have answered every question you had asked with great seriousness and thoroughness presented you with links to some of the articles i had been hounded to waited for your help then you did other things instead of helping i cannot believe it because i had trusted you to act in an evenhanded manner 
 you havent breathed a word about how you know there is consensus for your links not one i am completely evenhanded asking anyone who wishes to add links to commercial sites how they know they have consensus im still asking name three editors who agree with your edits who makes up this consensus 
 there is a complaint at an or i i left a lengthy statement i am trying to put thinkgs in a bigger context if you have time to read the discussion and my comment and if you feel i am misrepresenting the issues i hope you will correct me 
 i have been trying to stay out of all this because of who the the other party is but i will read it over 
 im sorry i should have been more clear the editors having made the rfc against me are wikihounding me to many articles they had never before edited probably at least twenty over the past two weeks increasing each day and always undoing or reverting my edits or attempting to delete articles i have contributed to or begun i thought i had been clear about this earlier please help please 
 you are telling me the same thing over and over again and its not an answer to my question i agree that they are hounding you but i cant do anything about it unless you help me you have to explain to me how we know that most wikipedians support your edits how do we know that how can i tell what the consensus thinks you tell me about people hounding you but i want to know what the wikipedia community at large thinks of your links in the 
 let me do my best to answer your question though the answer may actually be apparent many of the pages i edit are on fairly esoteric subjects yet i edit on such subjects out of a love and desire to accurately and completely document these lesserknown subjects for the world this often means that there arent many or any editors who assist in creating these articles or discussing their content but what has happened is that there have arisen a handful of very active editors who have been wikihounding me to many pages they had not before edited always in an attempt to undo my edits or entirely delete pages this has been increasing over the past few weeks today increasing to many many pages this takes the form of a sort of tag team reversion is against wp policy and thus artificially biased against me i have edited for many years in close collaboration with many editors working productively and very rewardingly but in these cases the pages are not highly frequented and i do not canvass others since wps focus is creating the most encyclopedic bestsourced articles possible and thus our community consensus is that we use the best sources available as a longtime editors i always make a point of doing that however the wikihounding which i have asked you to help with at least N times has not stopped but only increased you continue to ask me to explain my edits again and again yet have not spoken one word to attempt to dissuade the handful of editors who have been wikihounding so intently please help 
 look theres a problem here i can only defend you in terms of edits so if you wont talk to me about those then it is havery difficult for me to help you understand now the hounding is a problem i can help you address it but it has to be done my way if you dont like my way get someone else to help you you will find that im willing to do a lot on your behalf but you have to do your part are you willing to do this 
 earlier you said you take a hard line against wikihounding but now you say you support such behavior and will not enforce against it i cannot believe this you are stating that you are not evenhanded i thought all our admins needed to be please help 
 i will enforce against it if you let me do it my way right now you are in the way you have to cooperate with me or i cannot help i only work my way and im very effective if you want my help its on my terms take it or leave it 
 thank you im sorry i dont understand the above i had answered all your questions as thoroughly as possible the hounding is being done by about four different editors for the past two or so weeks it has reached a crescendo in recent days 
 i can help you but only if you explain to me how i can know that your links at 
 we encourage a diversity of opinions on wikipedia but wikipedia 
 once again wikipedia isnt a soapbox for your views on N or N 
 im sorry i dont understand i sent you a very thorough response above but you only sent me something like an ultimatum not addressing the wikihounding 
 what dont you understand i will break it down i can help you in N way its not what you are expecting you have to trust me and do what i ask if you do then after some time the hounding will end because we will deal with it thats the only way i can help you so you either have to agree to trust me or theres nothing else to talk about if you want someone to simply yell at those editors or revert to your version then ask another admin there are hundreds i will help you in a way that you may not even imagine but only if you agree to put the hounding question on hold and do as i say otherwise i cant help you im sorry i only work one way and im very effective if you agree to work my way you will be very pleasantly surprised otherwise i guess im not the admin you were looking for 
 since its a short video shouldnt the title be in quotes rather than italics throughout the article i noticed that the italicizes all of the videos they covered but per 
 you are right i have changed it to quotes now thanks 
 although i said i would not participate i do have solid evidence in the form of diffs that the rfc was created and acted upon in bad faith and an attempt was made to bait badagnani into edit warring and incivility 
 i dont know badagnanis behavior that i have observed is pretty problematic whether or not the editors pursuing him are involved hes been extremely uncooperative with me and absolutely refuses to even consider the idea that he should respect consensus if hes adding spammy commercial links to articles then those reverting him are doing good work your case for harassment will be pretty laughable unless you can show that they have reverted anything worthwhile you refused to take up that question with me which tells me that you dont actually know of any good work of his thats been reverted either that or you are just choosing to be uncooperative i dont really care which it is im ignoring you on this topic until i see you say anything useful thanks for understanding 
 i will add i rest my case to the list of words and expressions whose meanings you are unclear about 
 i see by your response that you remain as utterly clueless and as utterly boorish as you have ever presented yourself i would suggest that at least in the real world you try to avoid using words and phrases whose meanings you are so clearly unsure about far from making you look smart when you misuse words or turns of phrase like rest my case it makes you look silly if you ever do grow up let me know i will know it is time to actually engage in reasoned discussion instead of your silliness then 
 oh okay i guess i overreacted sorry about that its just since with piccolo fighting freiza i just thought that it was mid anyway if there is a piccolo with a much different attack from piccolo early and piccolo end that has to be piccolo mid but like you said we need offical proof first hopefully there is a piccolo mid because they cant just skip early and go onto to end that would be stupid 
 i agree it wouldnt make much sense though save the absence of biobroly and hatchhyack im rather fond of the character roster as it is i also wish they would add some characters like kami and ginger and general rildo with all his forms still im not complaining blue and gt goku are enough to make me happy ^^ or or 
 hi please see 
 the thing is sourcing it wasnt a problem we know those are the voice actors but that sentence was just giving an example of some of the big name stars that were voicing the characters it was not a cast list and did not need everybodys name while we could have included everybody we didnt want to because that was not the place for it i hope you understand thanks 
 users may edit the articles during the discussion including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion however do not remove the articlefordeletion templates from the articles cheers 
 on a related note you may want to archive your talk page its getting pretty huge how about creating 
 i wanted to confirm that you and your guest would be in attendance tomorrow at the childrens museum backstage pass event we have a great day planned and we are looking forward to having you 
 yes i will be leaving for indianapolis this evening see you tomorrow 
 hey i just went ahead and reverted i was wondering if you wanted your userpage semiprotected to prevent that happening in the future 
 no problemo let me know if you change your mind cheers 
 not an urgent question but arent there some images that are too gruesome or offensive to be plastered on a wikipedia article for example a photo of a beheading or rape or necrophilia et cetera if such extreme photos exist then it makes some sense that there should also be a borderline area for which hide and show might be appropriate 
 i dont know the word plastered is a bit prejudicial id rather talk about shocking images in a more detached manner i think the idea is that we want to be where people can come to find out if an image of a beheading is necessary to illuminate the subject then we should have a picture of it if a picture of necrophilia would somehow helpfully illuminate the subject then we should have a picture of that i would be very surprised to see a picture that would meet the standard on either of those topics at autofellatio the argument was that its a bit of a contortion and it is therefore a question whether its actually possible the photo proves that it is i dont think theres any doubt that beheadings or necrophilia are physically possible 
 anyway this is kind of tangential to the article we have been working on it still boggles my mind that so many people could be in favor of censoring a mere drawing 
 what do you want to do convince me that its okay to hide some pictures why im not the person you need to convince if i were i wouldnt buy that a contortion of the human mind line regarding the abortion drawing that doesnt boggle my mind at all they are obeying their consciences just as you or i would 
 im not trying to convince you of anything just having a conversation and if you were trying to convince me i wouldnt buy that obeying their consciences line 
 really im sorry i was in a mood earlier my own worldview tends to the idea that everyone is pursuing the good as they see it how could anyone do otherwise if someone has a very different notion of good than i do it might be hard for me to believe that a conscience is prompting their actions but i have been wrong enough times to stop guessing i have certainly never gotten to know someone who wasnt clearly pursuing the good as they understand it some people are pretty broken but everyones got a good in mind if not then nothing i believe makes any sense 
 they are obeying their consciences but i wouldnt say as you or i would because the mechanics of it are so different you are right about almost everyone trying to do good and that includes the folks who are the subject of 
 maybe not so unusual judge not lest ye be judged we are all sinners maybe you have more in common with the pope than you think i personally dont subscribe to organized religion preferring the disorganized kind and i guess the same applies to philosophy in general i saw 
 im not sure why the blocked editor posted on your user page but he seems to be using 
 the categories have their uses but if they become a motivation and serve as a trophy case i agree and they do here per 
 can you semi prot the above it is getting spillover 
 done 
 < im not ignoring you i have just been a bit busy grad school and all i will attempt to insert the image tomorrow when i have a very clear head and some hours free to respond to the fallout 
 no problem thanks 
 my internet was down for a day now its back no idea why 
 please help me keep an eye out i am away from wikipedia about N hours a day drop me a message if i need to look into anything or go to 
 take a look at the 
 would you consider reversing your move of this article there is no clear consensus on the talk page nor even any real discussion the person suggesting the move never made appropriate notifications to the anime or manga project and i believe this move goes against the actual naming conventions i think this should have much more discussion before being carried out 
 oh i wish id known there was an objection the page entered the backlog at 
 well i have posted a notice to the anime or manga project and thus far in addition to my own objection two others have been logged i can see waiting though a day or two to allow more views though 
 if you come across a real cutandpaste mess you can explain whats happened at the 
 thought i would include an example of the first way of fixing cutandpaste moves since it was difficult to explain and may have been confusing a user cutandpasted 
 hes back and back to the same editwarring and harassment im writing up a new N rr report continuing from yesterday i have also started a sockpuppetry case on his talk page as well it looks like all the 
 ronz what i said to the anon below is equally directed to you those are my conditions for helping i should post this somewhere permanent i reckon 
 you have edited it just as much as he has if you are both editwarring why should i help you and not him if you want me to do something give me links showing that ronz is repeatedly reverting to the same version also if you want help from me show that you have taken the initiative of bringing up the dispute on the talk page on the talk page describe the content dispute calmly and independently of the behavior issues when you have done that stuff let me know if you want an admin to play cop and write the other guy a ticket then you dont want me cause i dont roll that way all i do is dispute aresolution 
 doesnt this heading violate talk page guidelines see 
 i dont read guidelines what i was trying to do with that section was put my finger on the exact point where badagnani seems to be disagreeing with others i only used his name because hes been the only person arguing for his edit after many rounds of discussion i think i know what hes claiming and what im claiming and i think they are both reasonable positions that a sane and sober person my hold i would like to find out what a larger crosssection of the community thinks of the principle that badagnani is applying but before doing that i thought it would be advisable to be sure that im stating his position correctly does that make sense 
 heh so do i need to turn a guideline into a policy to get you to read it 
 policies are doubly avoided i also refuse to recognize the distinction between the two its okay im trained in paradoxswallowing 
 damn i was hoping to sucker punch you with 
 you know if you tell me i have violated wpacronym im likely to say i dont read guidelines if you tell me im being a jerk to another editor im likely to listen to you take a critical look at my behavior and respond thoughtfully im a little surprised that you knowing who i am would approach me with guidelines and policies instead of ordinary talk i have as you have no doubt noticed changed the section title which was never intended to offend anyone i continue to welcome your input on the larger issue 
 most of the time offense is perceived not intended i recommended the change due to badagnanis protest on the talk page some people do try to offend others and others offend them without really knowing it or caring if they offend the best response to those people is a huge smile and a compassionate tone but as you are well aware it is difficult to do that here where we are reduced to ascii and smilies one thing i have noticed is how some people take offense just for the sake of taking offense it seems to be an attentiongetting tactic that allows them to vent their anger at the world and gives them an excuse to fight with anyone who doesnt agree with them but at the end of the day look at how many people are here to fight bicker and throw their weight around it takes an extra effort to make a concession to compromise with an opponent and to truly work together 
 i wanted to point out a minor technicality though your use of on image pages with disputed rationales is correct but on article pages implies that a disputed fair use rationale is a criterion for speedy deletion (in contradiction of 
 hi i came over to mention an afd here but wanted to point out that dfu is a speedy criterion under 
 ah good catch vague templates are vague maybe i can suggest an improvement there 
 i edited article directly to spare you time as thats usual on wikipedia 
 thanks of course you edited it what else could you do sorry for bugging you to lecture my work wont do that again this one was rather important 
 kein problem 
 i appreciate that you are trying hard to resolve this dispute but let me suggest to you that you are getting more frustrated than we are worth i hope you can avoid the trap and maintain your presence at the article long term you are a credit to the wiki i hope in time you can respect me as i do you i assure you whatever disagreements we have they are not personal to me in anyway 
 i appreciate your concern and thanks also for the vote of confidence i think i made a mistake the other evening what i was looking for was a calm place to edit and get away from the stres of events elsewhere in the pedia choosing 
 conversation about redirecting those projects is located 
 ps hi 
 afds run for N days not N hours probably others would have noticed 
 you neednt tell me how afd works i dont speedy close for fun or for no reason that article was in my opinion a liability to the project as it existed and we are better without it it was worse than a nonsense article or a vanity page the only possible outcome of the discussion other than deletion would be to start from scratch and thats possible now not all afds run for N days and thats always been true all of that said since you questioned my close i will post at 
 and here it is 
 will you be interested in giving an editor assistance in 
 i will take a look at it i cant guarantee i will be able to solve the problem but i dont try we will never know thanks for informing me about this 
 i didnt want to mess up the giveandtake in the talk page there as you have sorta asked a question of the floor so im responding to you here i just wanted to clarify that you dont have to add that sentence to the policy page its already there but i havent been able to get the people who were repeatedly deleting it to explain why they were doing so beyond extremely brief vague statements such as its inappropriate 
 well maybe we will get a clear reply from one of them and figure out whats really going on 
 pardon me but is there a reason why you that submission we are currently in the process of reviewing a large number of afc submissions in a batch and although you are free to improve and give comments on the article im curious as to why you accepted it when i was in the middle of modifying it thanks 
 ah i didnt see your comment on the batch discussion page my apologies 
 as far as cost id bet that N ounces of capsaicin will do you for a lifetime if squirrels have the trpvN receptor i will pretty much guarantee you they wont be back only really stupid humans such as myself go back to the same place and cry out for more and worse pain 
 i might do this thank you 
 meanwhile i realize many people can just 
 huh thats a lot to respond to what do you think of what i have been saying about the practical expediency of using rhetoric that is likely to convince people i dont think i have seen you address that issue did i miss it i tend to think that extra links on disambiguation pages are deprecated for a good reason and i refrain from using them the argument that convinced me is that disambiguation pages are not articles and they serve precisely one purpose to get someone to the article that they were actually looking for in the first place what do you find unconvincing about that argument 
 another reply as you might know very little is decided in public forums while the real changes happen in the 
 i have tried to awaken people to the deadlock situation with 
 yeah i dont see a problem that needs solving here i have replied at the guideline talk page you can say all you like about backrooms but i personally stay out of them 
 could i ask you to clarify your reasoning for these edits 
 hello please see 
 sorry but i wont undelete the template per the rfc it was a valid deletion 
 N aprilN in the world at large many people have learned that others often become defensive in public forums and decisions cannot be effectively reached it is not just a matter of using the proper 
 my experience disagrees with your assessment i have seen way too many people use emphatic language as you call it and come to grief on wikipedia i have also seen a lot of people learn that more conciliatory rhetoric is their friend and they end up being very successful here you can ignore that or you can take it onboard 
 one other reply in the world at large many people have learned that others often become defensive in public forums and decisions cannot be effectively reached i have found that people in public forums become defensive precisely in proportion to the extremeness of the rhetoric used i have been very successful in public wikipedia spaces avoiding the defensiveness reaction by speaking in ways that people dont interpret as needing defense against the rhetoric with which you introduced your topic at the mos talk page was havery likely to provoke a defensive reaction you might consider presenting your ideas differently my experience indicates that you will see a lot less defensiveness if you moderate your own tone 
 hello feinoha this is an automated message from 
 this is a sockpuppet that continues to return to harass people personally i dont believe he should be given any help 
 thanks for dealing with that i tried to move the page and i got an error message that id never seen before about the target page name being on a blacklist and requiring an admin to move it 
 oh wow thats weird i didnt get any special message moving it anyway cheers 
 hi gt i wonder if youd be so kind as to consider refactoring your comment that insisting on ones refactoring if others involved complain about it becomes rude it leaves the impression that i insisted on refactoring someones comments which is clealry not the case thanks for your kind consideration have a nice day and feel free to correct my spelling or grammar any time cheers 
 i certainly didnt mean to imply that and im not certain the sentence does so but i will reword it since it bothers you 
 on another matter sometimes an editor can be harangued and harassed by persons with ill intent or a lack of good sense i felt that you didnt seem to appreciate this fact in dealing with a situation involving another editor recently certainly that editor can be 
 thanks for the feedback i dont know how much of that interaction you got to witness but i was extremely insulted by that editors treatment of myself and i admit that i posted at least once or twice in frustration which is never a good idea i started out with a much more conciliatory tone but after being insulted a few times i was a bit combative if you want someone to help you then imperiously telling them how to do their job is a terrible idea my one previous interaction with that user didnt help he was making blatantly racist insults on a talk page and i asked him to stop he responded by laughing in my face and telling me that we make racist comments all the time and that i must be a newbie or a fool then i told him i was an admin of three years and he got havery quiet thats a bad way to give a first impression dont you agree as for the ill intent or lack of good sense in the other editors i cant speak to that too directly because i cant read their minds the faults i saw in them were entirely parallel and comparable to similar faults in the one editor and in a situation such as that my conscience does not allow me to say that one side is right and the other wrong i took his side as best i could but he continued to spit in my face over and over again how many times would you take it i have made comments to the editors you mention and i hope you dont imagine that im turning a blind eye to provocative behavior from anyone i simply cannot see the situation as a good guys and bad guys issue if you have any position of trust with that editor perhaps you can let him know that dictatorially demanding that an admin do what he says is a very very very foolish and bad idea it leads directly to sadness N per cent of the time we are humans it turns out and we are not being paid for this also uN and this is my experience in life perhaps yours is different uN the more someone repeats a statement about themselves the less likely that its true insisting repeatedly that one is an important and valuable contributor is very likely to convince people that one is not again if the editor listens to you and if you agree then maybe you can pass that on 
 i confirm that i have requested account creation access 
 thank you for applying to access the account creation tool i have approved your request you may now access the tool before you do so please read the tools 
 hey can you block this moron from editing the iihf page or what can i do in such cases 
 thanks since you were here longer and i saw you undid his version i thought i may just ask since ixbN m pretty new 
 i think we basically agree on most of the points involved it takes all types to build a great encyclopedia and i try to be tolerant of those whose styles and approach are different than mine that editor has been extraordinarily gracious and helpful to me when i have had questions even as they are stubborn and obstinate on editing points they have been here a while and have contributed a massive amount that makes me feel puny and insignificiant in comparison i noticed you wrote someones as a conjunction of someone has on an editors talk page but i didnt dare fix it under the circumstances isnt that just silliest and saddest state of affairs on a wiki anyway thanks for your collegial replies and discussion take care 
 well you may consider yourself welcome to copyedit my text im not bothered by it of course under the present circumstances i can see why youd refrain 
 he just doesnt seem to get the point fixing someone elses grammar or spelling is nannyism it is not his place to do that unless invited which you just did otherwise it is potentially very impolite now if you say to someone as a followup did you mean then thats fair they can then change it if they want or they can say yes thats what i meant and i will be the first to agree that spelling and grammar here and on the internet in general is atrocious it often offends my own eyes to have to look at it but it is not my place to mess with it at best i can call someones attention to it if the meaning is unclear but it is not my place to tinker with their actual words its a line not to cross i will also add that if you see spelling and grammar mistakes in my writing you are welcome to call my attention to it and then i can change it as i see fit 
 ah so its not your place to correct another editors grammar and spelling but it is your place to leave driveby insults on ani i notice you didnt actually respond to the content of my note you changed the subject childofmidnight is not the one being uncivil in this situation at least not the part i can see you get your own house in order then criticize others 
 oh and you just said you would steer clear of this editor baldfaced lie much dont post here again please unless you grow up first 
 ok now that the ograbme has been lifted a couple of points of fact first keep in mind that the N N or N is in rabbit years second i have facial hair so i cant let you get away with calling me a baldfaced liar > 
 bet i have got more 
 does longer qualify as more its still the same number of roots so are you saying you look like this guy 
 that was going to be my next comment 
 sure no problem 
 actually getting a new computer likely has nothing to do with the new ip address its more probable that your isp reassigned ip addresses recently and you got one that was used by a vandal if you have no intention of editing wikipedia then you do not need to do anything a block only affects editing privileges if you would like to edit just set up an account if you get assigned a blocked ip address later then you can just log in and continue to edit 
 you seem like a smart person so you have got me wondering about is this really true who are these people everyone i can think of with that kind of ineptitude has ended up causing way more harm than good as i remember it 
 well the ones who arent disruptive you dont know about right thats what its like under the radar wikipedia is full of people who have terrible collaboration skills but who manage not to offend enough people severely enough to cause real trouble i mean this guys been around for years has he caused way more harm than good before someone complained about that picture if so i havent seen the evidence did you read that article like yesterday about a study that showed that people who contribute to wikipedia tend to have poor social skills and dont contribute out of altruism now i wish i could remember where i found that link i can think of three or four users off the top of my head who are complete assholes but who generally stick to wikignoming so it isnt a problem as for ineptitude im not sure what you see as inept about the user in question i think hes a jerk but i dont see that hes an idiot what do you mean by inept 
 i suppose its just a selection bias on my part i remember the inept users who have blown up spectacularly because they blew up spectacularly i basically meant socially inept but apparently this description fits me today too in my brain i made the connections thus N i see someone with 
 heh good call that actually is the direction the article went saying that many wikipedia contributors do not feel empowered in normal social settings and try to attain that here instead i have been told by more than one editor in the last couple of weeks that they are here for themselves no more i hear it and id like to block them and throw away the key but i dont think thats a tenable solution they are after all making good edits a lot of the time i just try to give them a wide berth and when i have to interact with them i put on my best professional face and try to take the inevitable abuse gracefully theres a skill that we never really talk about here but it would be a good one to see more of im thinking of diplomacy basically theres a way to ask someone to do something so that they want to do it and think they are being really cool by doing it rather than thinking someone has just forced them into something they dont want people who can do this well are very powerful in the world i dont know how we can encourage more diplomacy in the interactions here its a cultural change and those are hard to bring about 
 please could you forward this to the lgbt group project 
 as mentioned on your talk page all article must indicate why someone is 
 could someone help with the page moves i made when creating the article for 
 give me a minute and i will clean it up for you 
 right i have deleted both typo redirects you should be able to fix any broken links without admin help but let me know if anyhting else needs deleting best 
 i have had it with that character and will try to steer clear of him in the future at the rate hes going i expect him to eventually be banned but that will be for someone else to take care of 
 you may be right i think your advice to yourself is excellent 
 hes a large part of the reason i dont work on the obama articles anymore i found his dark night essay highly insulting to the rest of us and i just posted it on ani a few minutes ago because he called my coddling vandals statement a personal attack so i thought it necessary to post the specific reason i said that and that should be the end of that discussion from my standpoint i called that one as i saw it and maybe others would see it differently and they can comment on it or not as they please the point being that instead of helping out he chided the defenders for being too mean to the sleeper accounts and other redlinks that came out of the woodwork to commit mayhem thanks to an offensive wnd packoflies article about wikipedia his priorities here are N degrees wrong and thats the problem i have stopped watching his talk page as of right now but his socalled rfa nomination page is definitely still on my watch list though hes very unlikely to follow through on it but just in case 
 that user will not become an admin you neednt worry about it silly boy im absolutely uninterested in whatever you are talking about i can judge editors around here by my own standards thank you very much run along now 
 hi can you explain please 
 okay you are 
 anyone whose time was being wasted by it has precisely one person to thank for that this statement seems clear to me but i expect it will be read exactly the opposite way by others and maybe im wrong in my understanding was the ambiguity on purpose if not perhaps a clarification might be in order i look forward to learning for sure just who the one person is 
 i didnt mess up my quantifiers did i lets be formal for every editor x who feels their time was wasted there exists precisely one editor y whom they can thank yeah that works the solution is xy thats unless you have been going doortodoor and forcing people at gunpoint to comment on your notyetbegun rfa really you should know better than that some of us havent got doors 
 the link section has a code what you would type and what it looks like i think that it shouldnt look like a redlink which it does maybe we could create a redirect to another example page a word of advice from 
 right now 
 from village pump the article is illegal immigration in the united states you will see my attempts to resolve this issue in both camarons talk page and tnxmans talk page please leave your comments in your talk page so i can find them thanks
 you seem to bounce around ip addresses a lot is there a reason you dont set up an account im not suggesting you should just asking it actually gives you greater anonymity in the sense that people cant figure out that you are posting from massachusetts am i right 
 im reading through some article history and talk page discussion if you could summarize for me your primary issue with the content of the article that would be very helpful thanks 
 finally theres this i can only help you if you accept my condition that condition is that you will talk about the article content only and allow me to determine for myself whatever i need to know about other editors behavior if you are willing to do that then i can probably help you my initial impression on that talk page is that its worth looking further into 
 i am concerned that you might not see all the relevant posts in all the related pages if i stick only to content however at this point im desperate i will accept your condition the fact that my ip keeps changing is due to my using an iphone the reason i dont have an account is rather complex it started because i was being stalked by another editor i felt safer being anonymous truth be told i still do however since i started having true anonymity i have come to believe that anonymity makes one a better editor rather than the edits content
 fair enough so it appears your issue with the article relates to the possible involvement of the government of mexico in helping mexicans cross the border illegally into the us right i will post a question at the talk page and see what people say i suspect we can get it unprotected because im working with you and you have agreed to drop the personal side at least for now 
 my issue with the article has to do with a pattern of behaviour by certain people and how that pattern of behaviour has impacted is impacting and will likely continue to impact the article on that point theres nothing more i feel at liberty to say given the agreement above except that this particular incident is only one example and i will be asking you for help in a lot more examples of the underlying problem in the future
 the reason for my condition i set is that im actually pretty good at determining disruptive behavior it will be clear to me whos abusive and who isnt however if come in on someones side i lose my powers i have got the article on my watchlist and i have already begun a conversation on the talk page lets see what happens 
 i have promised not to make any personal comments but i havent received any promises that the personal attacks against me will stop or that a certain editor will stop screwing around with my comments in the talk page without those promises the talk page doesnt feel like a place i can work
 and im getting back handed attacks like turn over a new leaf i will not conceed culpability in maintaining this problem i will cop only to the fact that way back when this thread started several editors said things that probably shouldnt have been said and i was one of the editors saying them
 i understand your reluctance to participate if you are going to be attacked what you ask for is fair and i do promise to defend your right to participate without being attacked if you are talking about article content and someone wants to mess with your comments i have got your back 
 fair enough i will wait for you to respond to the comment about turning over a new leaf
 where was this backhanded attack will i find it when i click over to the talk page in a second here 
 i have posted about it there and the talk page is no longer semiprotected tread carefully though until we have set up a good collaborative rapport with the page okay 
 it looks like if anything the personal attacks against me have increased your right im feeling frustrated i tried to get a third party involved to resolve a conflict issue and the other editor declined and made a personal attack i tried to use the talk page to resolve disputes and had my comments screwed with and then was made unable to post i tried to get you involved to help and its been treated as an admission of guilt i read those posts will beback posted and what i saw is a long history of abuse against ip anons i could go on and on and on about the activity in that talk page and article
 im going to hold off on posting to the article talk page and see if theres anything more you can do to stop the personal attacks
 i have been away for a lot of today but im back now lets have a look 
 if turn over a new leaf is really the worst insult we are talking about right now id suggest thats a small enough matter to let it go you feel insulted but i will guarantee you that others feel insulted as well by you now you know you havent been trying to insult people and im comfortable with that but if you have done it unintentionally i think some small gesture of good will can go a long way the article is more important than any of us is right 
 i have already copped to saying things which probably shouldnt have been said before tnxman locked down the article thats my measure of good will and while im not the only one who was guilty of that i am the only one copping to that after tnxman locked down the article i tried to work use the talk page for its intended purpose and got attacked and shut out i am not going to capitulate culpability for the current problem
 i certainly am not asking you to capitulate culpability nor anything resembling that you wont find it in my words if you wish to stand on ceremony and not participate until you get the right apology from the right person then you will remain standing there im not going to twist someones arm and force them to make nicer than they are willing first of all it wouldnt be effective and second it would make me a real jerk you either care more about the article or more about your pride im happy either way the fact is you were interlacing irrelevant and impolite remarks in your comments about the article right up until the end if complaining about your posts being screwed with is so important to you then you can do that and have no input on the article if you wish to have input on the article you will get past all of this pride drop the past and pony up to the talk page with some serious N per cent focused discussion if you had followed that policy previously you wouldnt be in this fix now i dont care one way or the other i will help you if you will be helped but i wont stroke your wounded ego what do you want more you may shop around but i think you will find im more accommodating than most administrators would be 
 having the statement turning over a new leaf when no one else will cop to anything wrong is certainly capitulating culpability you said you needed to be neutral then you expected the only person to make concessions to be myself so far you havent done anything other than attempt to have me roll over when people have prevented the talk page from being used for its intended purpose
 so what do you want me to do make them change how i cant just start issuing blocks you know im no more empowered than camaron what do you want me to do what do you want justice 
 is there some reason why the anon is not willing to get a username not having a username makes it very difficult for editors to communicate with you or even to know what to call him while an occasional anonymous edit is fine participating in extensive editing and talk page discussions without getting a name is not consistent with community norms the appearance is that he is avoiding scrutiny and nbsp 
 i can see how you might see it that way the editor answered above in this section your question he felt he was being harassed my suggestion would be a middle ground between anonymous editing and an account use some kind of standard name to sign posts in addition to the regular fourtilde sig would that be an improvement in your mind 
 the answer for harassment is not to hide its to seek dispute resolution if the user has a complaint then he should make it rather than skulking around but yes if he signs his edits and talk page comments with a common name then that will do it it doesnt have to be registered and nbsp 
 i think that the editor was seeking dispute resolution when he posted the message to the village pump that inititally got my attention i think that by posting to my talk page here hes seeking dispute resolution meanwhile he doesnt trust people around here much and i dont blame him if editing from an ip does no harm and it makes him feel better then im okay with it i suspect we will see what he thinks of leaving personally identifiable signatures 
 what reason does he have to not trust people here if hes the user i think he is then he he hasnt been harassed or persecuted though he may feel that way we are not here to accomodate unfounded paranoia but to write an encyclopedia if the user cannot follow this projects norms then there are others where he might feel more comfortable this users been making personal attacks yet he claims to be the aggrieved party hes been acting the same way for three years if you can change his behavior then thatd be great and nbsp 
 you know i cant answer why somebody feels persecuted however i do believe that the feeling is sincere the idea that recognizing this means that we are here to accommodate unfounded paranoia is a bit of a stretch i think im willing to accept that he might be upset for the wrong reasons but im still going to practice deescalation yknow the ideal is that we all work together im not interested in charging him with personal attacks because i might not agree that his feelings of being hounded are sufficiently justified if hes willing to leave off the personal remarks then im willing to let all of the past go im here for the present and for the future not for the past 
 at the help desk i expect editors to ask a specific question however at the feedback desk it is generally understood that the editor is asking for general feedback in the case of a user draft such as this is it ready for main space some explicitly ask but some just post the article they have worked on in this case 
 on a more positive note thanks for reviewing 
 i took a look at the article after you posted your explanation here i dont agree with you that the article looks like a list i do however think that the article is getting way too long and perhaps could be split per the guidelines at 
 i splitted the article to other 
 hello thanks for leaving a message outlining your concerns about the wwwcontemporaryartdailycom links i added to a number of artists websites while i understand wikipedias need to guard against spam and promotion i think those links pass the wikipedia guidelines in that they N feature relevant copyrighted media content with permission of the exhibition spaces N display many installation views not easily found elsewhere on the net including at the galleries pages themselves and N the links direct to index pages which can automatically update with additional material in the future if you could elaborate on what you think is inappropriate about the presence of the links that would be very helpful 
 i removed your links to the contemporary art daily site based on the the fact that at the time you appeared to be adding them to many articles i do not have anything against you nor contemporary art daily i suggest you read 
 or styleverticalalign top bordertop N px solid gray or for your excellent online support and for watchlistbot it rocks 
 thanks much appreciated 
 actually i was only following orders was no defence even then to insert while under the orders of is to take a point of view on the matter markham was a bloody fool and should not have driven camperdown into victoria the same logic would apply to bourke they both got away with it because it was too embarassing to admit rn captains had no more sense than this oh and bourke being well connected 
 no i dont really mean that as a complaint which on reflection it sounds like you added a bit of info which is the right thing to do its the usual problem of covering a complex thing very briefly 
 i dont know much about bourke i recall in gordons book he says something like the court was hand picked to make sure they got the right result at the court martial and i think it was by his friend the prince of wales which makes sense given the extra info in the bourke article such as it is about him captaining prince alfreds yacht i have no idea if he was any good as a naval officer it was your edit comment that bourke was acquitted because tryon was in charge that set me off i dont think that was the reason i dont believe tryon was off his head on the day he expected the captains to do something sensible and out of the possible options ramming the two ships together was not the best choice i am still looking for an expert on naval maneuvers to give a view on whether the two lines crossing in between ships was a viable outcome tryon gave them orders and then trusted them to carry out something off the wall safely they didnt so it was correctly tryons fault for overestimating their ability but all the same they had been given explicit orders just before never to blindly follow orders which would endanger their ships i am guessing that tryon was keeping some sort of eye on what victoria did which was to turn hard so presumably he though this reasonable it would have been harder for him to see exactly what markham was doing which mostly was squabbling with his captain about how the hell to make it work markham said he decided victoria would turn outside the circle of his ship which strikes me as pretty daft given victoria turned tighter than camperdown and was signalling a maximum tight turn at the last minute markham saw victoria was inside him so used engines to try to turn faster if anything he should have reversed helm and used engines oppositely to go outside victoria or as i quite suspect tryon intended pass behind her instead of trying to go through her 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or for your as a writer of the signposts news and notes and in the news sections which i was allowed to witness as the signposts editor during recent months i award you the signpost barnstar regards 
 thank you it has been really rewarding and fun writing for signpost and something i hope to continue uN 
 you said they were serving up lunch and i know how much you like eating these 
 nah thats more of a #wikipediaenadmins pastime uN 
 i know that you are frustrated and you have every right to feel that way i will agree that you have been wronged however i will not let you dictate to me how to do my job how wikipedia works or how you want to get justice out of an encyclopedia which is a bit like trying to get blood out of a turnip 
 oh if you want to get the attention of a lot of admins at once post to 
 twice you asked me what i want in the article dispute you posed it as a direct question and you even bold typed it then when i answer you treat it as if im bossing you around i know its too much to ask for justice im trying to deal with the fact that its too much to ask for integrity what you seem to have meant to ask isnt what do i want but how little will i settle for im trying to work the answer to that question out
 sigh i dont mean to be inconsistent or rude im sorry it has happened in the past that people ask me for help and then start telling me how to do my job in fact it has happened to me quite recently so im probably letting some of my irritation from that interfere with this issue i apologize for that now i see what you are asking for i dont think i have the power to do that i cant make people apologize i cant make people take back things they said i cant even warn them in a way they will take seriously im just some guy there are two other admins against me for crying out loud what am i supposed to do grow wings what i can do and im pretty good at is help you in a content dispute if you are bothered by behavior then i can help you with that but i can only do it one way im a onetrick pony i cant play cop im incompetent at that all i can do is help negotiate a content dispute it turns out that this is also the only effective way to deal with the type of behavior you are complaining about but i guess you just dont believe me about that i dont know how to help you im a onetrick pony if you want that trick done i will do it but i wont play cop because i cant there are like N other active admins the only ones who are willing to play cop are assholes i avoid them 
 by the way and i foolishly didnt say this sooner i dont believe in culpability i dont think that you are in the least bit to blame for anything i dont believe in the reality of blame thats why i was not suggesting anything about culpability i think its like the toothfairy only pernicious i can defend this point with all the vigor of a degree in philosophy and a pretty wellexamined life but i dont think thats the conversation you are looking to have suffice to say that i hold you to be utterly blameless forever in all matters everyone else too im weird but if you just agree to put aside whatever you are hung up on and let me edit content alongside you you will find that im a pretty good person to have around 
 in response to existing personal attacks your response is stating that you are powerless to do anything about it yet you insist that you will help against such attacks in the future if you are powerless now how exactly is it that you wont be powerless the next time it happens
 thats easy firstly and most importantly i work in a context dressing someone down for something they did a week or a month ago is useless our site policies explicitly note that we never take punitive measures only preventative ones also give me a chance what have you got to lose in context im telling you that im pretty good at dealing with people making personal attacks it involves being there when it happens you got more questions just give me a chance man it doesnt cost you a thing and whats your alternative im offering you so much and you are being so picky im offering to get down in the trenches with you and work alongside you you dont like it walk away see how far that gets you have you even asked any other admins or why are you still even talking to me why 
 look i have reached out to try dispute resolution so many times you have no idea in this dispute alone i tried to wikidemon to agree to a third party opinion he declined and made a personal insult i tried to resolve the issue as tnxman suggested i got more personal attacks and was shut out of the talk page i tried to work with camaron he turned a blind eye to the attacks id been getting you offered to help i said sure it was treated as an admission of guilt then you said you didnt want to do anything about what has happened for fear of looking like a dick turns out your idea of dispute so far is the equivalent of being carpet bombed so yeah i have got some trust issues right now and your answer to that is to just blindly trust you i dont trust anyone on wikipedia right now i have asked you to give me a reason to
 thanks for the revert on my user page 
 no problem uN 
 hey tom thanks for i ran across the concept on cnn this morning and tried a couple of ways to find it and was shocked that there was no article but you know i wonder if it even makes sense to keep that redirect i mean no one is going to type in 
 looks like its pretty well covered already 
 im not totally sure why i have been invited to participate thanks for the offer though uN 
 do you have an extra negative in your support of 
 thanks uN 
 hi tom i notice that you found all the user pages that i lost i wanted to keep a list of pages i had competed as they were when i completed them so i created user pages for each article i moved your commented pages to my user page and am wondering if i can keep them there or if i should delete them 
 well keep them if there is some benefit in keeping them if you dont plan on improving the article in the near future feel free to nominate them for speedy deletion using if you delete them and want them back just ask an admin for future reference you can locate all your user subpages using 
 hullo tom just been looking at stories for next weeks 
 as we discussed on irc if we put the aaron swartz story in in the news we dont have to shunt dans interview out of news and notes i will have a bash at writing up something for it later gotta go do open source things now uN 
 that works for me thanks again 
 hello back in december you asked me about the source code of the if you are still interested it is now available at https or or githubcom or apocN or reftag it is written in python if you want to run it yourself you will need the google app engine sdk and api keys for google books and other data sources 
 oh my thank you apoc i will have a look shortly great work uN

 you also added the words allegedly and hussain to the section about obama which are blatantly npov by giving the unsupported idea that obama wasnt born in hawaii much more weight than it deserves per 
 no response in nearly a month yep you probably hate me to death now a year from now at this rate you might hate me at much as hitler hated the semites oh well 
 thank you so much for that valuable information regarding ruttons articles you have given me a lot of work to do thanks again 
 i need your help again on 
 that looks good thanks 
 was there a consensus that the current genres for 
 you are changing it so the onus is on you to discuss it and find sources 
 will do sorry 
 and welcome back to wikipedia 
 yes and all claims need to be sourced what you wrote was unsupported speculation 
 i see that you took the nowirrelevant comment out of 
 most of the articles on analytical philosophy need much work 
 that would be fine thank you 
 as for the two articles idea im new and action is not my thing but i cannot see the need for two i see philosophical work to define and understand action as exactly what the philosophy of action is up to (had i seen 
 ok that was my proposal there are other people who think like you thoml and there are people who think like i think i still think that when the articles grow long enough the need for two articles will appear in any case this is the way i would edit 
 they are bombarding otrs as well as trying to get you and morton devonshire onwiki 
 thats weird since i havent been that deeply involved in working on N or N realted pages for a while now i leave a comment or two every now and then but the last major work i did was when i added all the cite templates in the september N N attacks article almost a year ago to get that article looking better since it was the N year anniversary of the attacks 
 what complete tripe he says that morton alone deleted four articles but one of those articles hasnt even been deleted and morton did not nominate the other three and since morton does not have an admin bit he cant delete anything anyway but this explains a lot i have caught a few stray comments from newer users about my nefarious involvement with N or N articles the only problem is i dont think i have ever edited a N or N related article maybe you and morty will get mentioned on art bell that would be cool 
 hello i saw your mediation filed at rfm i have been cleaning it out and im wondering if mediation is still desired i can assign a mediator or allow grace note to whichever is preferred 
 er i guess ed poor has been mediating nevermind then 
 does any one object if i move this thread to 
 i dont mind 
 ok since the user this is about seems to want it moved as well i will move all nonarticle talk now 
 greetings i have had to revert this addition a number of times and i admit im puzzled as to why it keeps getting added back the does not even mention monsters inc N in any way shape or form if you have a 
 crap i accidentally clicked rollback on my watchlist sorry or 
 apology accepted gracefully i just got rollback this week and have been afraid about what would happen if i did that by accident no worries and thanks 
 just wondering why you lied on caroline no and said there is nothing on the talk page you responded to something on the talk page id better get those four tildes in 
 look at the time stamps 
 you recently blocked this editor why his recent edit for spondon or robert priseman was correct perhaps he does not know about the pendantics of wiki editing but his edit in this case would appear to be in good faith 
 i didnt block himim not an administrator that account was blocked for being a sockpuppet of 
 glad to hear that oneself having been the recipient of some malicious warnings from some nerdy editors also one be still to come to terms with the ins and outs of wiki editing etiquette 
 do you know him moi knows of him he has not mentioned spondon on his own website just derbyshire but he has confirmed elsewhre spondon how much proof do you need do you like the dark or are you simply intent on leaving others in it 
 do you not understand what a

 i have just gone to 
 no i realize that my two reverts brings me close to

 oh where exactly did you report me and for what 
 what do i do it says on agks talk page that he is retired 
 interesting he didnt tell me about it i will review the pending list soon 
 hi i completely agree with your reversions removing this specious reagan story not on one account from someone pushing a book indeed now taken up by conservative websites and still very doubtful would you let me know if this becomes an issue so i can weigh in i have so many pages on watch that i might miss this and dont want to thanks and nice to meet you i have certainly seen you around for a long time 
 yes this is going to be a fun few days my edit has already been reverted i asked that editor to at least discuss his reasons on the talk page basically a disgruntled exemployee has published some nonsense that should be easily be refuted based on lennons own words during the last year of his life the playboy interviews for starters now fox et al are jumping on it like this is significant good to meet you tooseen your name around but i do believe this is the first time we have officially crossed paths 
 come on come on the article still tells the reader the neutrality of this article is disputed please see the discussion on the talk page please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved but there still is no sign of any dispute to be resolved again i dont say that the article is not promotional i remain sitting on the fence my rear end is starting to hurt so if i cant have a proper ringside seat to view your allegations and the replies that they get i want to return to my regular chair elsewhere if theres still no clear allegation in the talk page a day or so from now i will delete the warning template 
 this has been discussed already on the talk page we dont print rumours 
 #N on your tastypoutine the article is original material and in my view informative of what a tijuana bible is i have graphics showing different styles over the different time periods i have links to graphics exemplifying points i am making in my article i have examples of original advertisements for the product i think it has worth as an article what more are you looking for 
 the site for the first link you added http or or wwwtijuanabiblescom or did not exist so assuming a typo i tried dropping the s from bibles and that took me to a sales site that would never pass 
 thanks i will try to remember to warn vandals i usually give a warning if the edit came from a user account but i dont generally warn ip only edits should i be warning ips 
 definitely unless they have received sufficient notice they are generally not blocked and nbspuN and nbsp 
 ok thanks 
 could you tell me why your rollback script identified as vandalismuN 
 thats my bad i thought it was a new user throwing up a typical hello world style message i should have been paying more attention especially given that hello is part of the title of the page again i apologize and i will try to be more careful in the future 
 if you do not want this user right you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time 
 thanks 
 if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of 
 ok i have responded on the talk page of the article in question 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised removing will stop the 
 i will put a little more work into this article 
 hello i am contacting you regarding a revert you made to the 
 sorry about that my bad 
 hello there i have noticed you are a frequent user of my software tool 
 thanks i will check it out 
 i replied to this on the request for help on your talk page 
 actually i saw that you had reverted one such edit and iam informing of the same thing once more try to protect the article thanks for your good work bring it to the attention of admins regards 
 thanks for your help in keeping wikipedia free from vandalism i dont think that page protection is necessary in this case because vandalism on the page is relatively infrequent let me know if you need anything else 
 interesting that information should definitely be included in the article it would be a good idea to be clear that your article is about an ancient now nonexistent city perhaps even in the article title also you could add a disambiguation link on the

 thank you bugs this was helpful 
 indeed i should have looked there first mea culpa 
 any particular reason for mangling the maps with i agree that the use of div tags to create pushpin maps is not idea but changing them to empty is even worse thanks 
 that was a mistake thanks for rolling it back i will try to be more careful about this type of edit in the future 
 hey left can you tell me if family guy looks good for an fac i looked at the simpsons history and it kind of looks the same 
 it probably needs a copyedit performences for example is a spelling error 
 and in general how is it 
 the content looks good although i havent had time to read it all 
 ok thanks just cleand up the spelling 
 sorry sometimes i get out of my head i took of peters got woods but let the perfect castaway hope it dose not bother 
 hi and thanks for the welcome im adding some references to the articles on towns now hopefully you can help me out with some lessintuitive tasks here 
 you bet let me know if you have any questions 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or i hereby recognize you jncranton for all your antivandalism work and continued use of the 
 thanks i appreciate the recognition thanks for creating an antivandalism tool which is simple quick and effective 
 i noticed you put a tag for speedy deletion on my new article i am a new user on wikipedia i am aware that article previously was deleted i thought i did a lot of work in changing a content and worked a lot on references i spent hours in doing this still thinking of creating a new solid encyclopedic version about this pianist i would rather get a motivation than discouragementi think 
 he thinks its promotional i think hes the one to ask about fixing it 
 did what i could hope it helps 
 i noticed your posting on the an board wondering about an essay as well as the work you have been doing in trying to help com over a difficult hump i dont know if its relevant or not but i did one early on that i have never really finished 
 a minor point but im not sure if its okay to refer to the disruptive and obstructionist editor i have been dealing with as a difficult hump 
 well actually i wasnt referring to any individual editor in that way the hump i was referring to was the situation the time frame issues and decision making process are more along the lines of what i considered to be a milestone to be breached not any particular millstone you may be experiencing i try to look more often to the edits that are performed in most cases rather than try to ascribe any particular personality to one the edits i had seen suggested to me that one may be in search of an essay about communication as i had touched on that topic some time ago i sought out the originator of the an post where i noticed it in brief review of usergbtaccus i noticed that gtb had been attempting to assist you in your quest to become an administrator and felt that several of those individual posts were also reflective of the nature of my essay henceforth i brought gtb the link to said essay uN 
 not to worry ched i knew i should have added a smiley face to my comment but i just couldnt bring myself to do it sorry for butting in i might have a look at your essay later so i can add my N cents and drop some knowledge on that subject communication is important i will let you and 
 i dont often say it but lol i have been likened to 
 ched hi thanks for the link i like the look of that essay theres one i wrote a little while ago called 
 laughed my but off on the wikilawyering one i could hear foxworthy doing it outloud then i realized how many of those i was guilty of not sure if i should laugh or cry now uN 
 i dont know but he left out if your family tree does not pov fork 
 if that actually means anything then please add it if its just a pun do whatever you like my original intention of the page is that it makes valid and valuable points in a funny way if the humor leaves the ground completely i will keep my grumbling to a minimum my intention with the page is actually to improve the encyclopedia by pointing out unhelpful behaviors but i dont own it 
 what it means is that you dont know who jeff foxworthy is and hence you are culturally deprived 
 bugs i recognize that your line above is a reference to the cultural phenomenon that i consciously referenced when writing the page good work super rock and roll imma go do somethin else now 
 yeppiree 
 ok thanks ttgl are you like my handler or mentor now 
 generally speaking there are no special buddies but most eds will be happy to help new wikipedians out if you contact them on their talk pages welcome aboard and happy editing 
 additionally the entire external links section is full of spam and should be deleted except for one or two links 
 you can do it you dont need my permission i was just to an rfpp request that didnt mean i was going to watch the thing unfold forever uN 
 hi laural you said i am also interested in putting up pages that are not on wikipedia but are of local significance what kind of articles do you have in mind id be delighted to help if they are within my expertise 
 i was thinking of starting some pages on the baronies of ireland tipperary is as good a place to start as any perhaps showing how the baronies may have had their origins in older gaelic chiefdoms does this interest you 
 dedicated articles on the baronies could be very interesting rather than shoehorning them into the leads of established articles about towns and villages they could of course be linked from these go for it 
 i have not seen the book i will look it up meanwhile for starters what about eliogarty 
 not implying that your eds cant be incorporated somewhere in article but not at lead best 
 why not the lead the lead already sets out a geographical hierarchy the addition of barony merely completes the picture without violating the strict hierarchy 
 see 
 ok but what about N opening paragraphthe first paragraph of the introductory text needs to unambiguously define the topic for the reader in an article devoted to a geographic entity surely an unambiguous strict verifiable hierarchical definition is preeminant 
 the article is about much more than geography strictly defined its as much about history politics sport commerce personalities etc have a look at irish towns of equivalent size to get a gist of what is usually located at the lead dont expect perfect consistency but ideally there should be an overall compatibility 
 in light of i guess i have been wasting my time here 
 now now rashers there no need to get in a miff its just that i felt that your argument for the noninclusion of baronies in the header didnt stack up by the logic set out above any article which deals with history politics sport commerce personalities etc should have all this set forth in the header this does not make practical sense a header is a header not a perfect abstract and if it was otherwise thenevery other article on every other irish town would also include all of the above in their headers but they dont so i think that im entitled to stict to a strict geographical interpretation of the bare minumum for the header and then let the article take its own direction imho 
 thats just misinterpreting what i said the lead is intended to give a succinct impression of the overall content having such detail on the baronies at the lead gives it undue weight please reconsider your current pattern of editing this and similar articles 
 i dont think that its a misinterpretation of what you said more a case of bringing it to its logical conclusion but for the sake of peace i have amended them i have put most of the baronial details in the references section 
 i did not ever expect you who wished to be a mentor of badagnani suggesting to block him alone you can get my sympathy from now you are so honestly saying that your mentorship is failed the next step for dr right after the useless rfc or u would be filing to the arbitration because he never responses to the raised concerns or refuses to fix his problems 
 like i said before i think im an extender of last chances if someone burns through my patience theres a good probability they have also exhausted the communitys patience if someone shows me wrong i will be very happy i never like seeing someone go if theres an arbcom case im sure i will see you there 
 honestly speaking admitting your failure on the mentorship seems to be not easy one you may know that i have not still added my view on his behaviors at his rfc because i hoped that he can change his attitude a bitbut well that seems to be not gonna happen without administrative interventions i dont think i will raise an arbcom case against him but if the case is open i might get involved 
 thank you for saying this the positive side of failing is that i have a chance to learn something i hope i can figure out what my lesson is in this case 
 i believe you have tried everything that you could do but enough is enough 
 dreadful supporters are the worst kind 
 if you look carefully youd know i just used the singular and definite article ( 
 heck im still trying to figure out gts for every editor x who feels their time was wasted there exists precisely one editor y whom they can thank the solution is xy explanation if you find a 
 some things we are just not meant to know 
 i was staring at this in incomprehension a streamer of drool gradually descending from my lower lip to the keyboard eyelids fluttering hypnotically when i was shocked into awakenness partly by a coughing fit and partly by realizing that hey im a math teacher i will bet i can figure this one out lets see x is an editor who feels their time was wasted by your rfa y is the person they have to thank theres a square on the hypotenuse and the law of cosines says the driver on the zaxis has rightofway if they are facing into the sun and im in gmtN and a kilo is N pounds no no i lost it i have gotta write an algebra test for tomorrow morning anybody got a clue about N xN N x + N N 
 the answer is N 
 use ctrl + f with dreadful in the page cheers 
 i hope he does turn up i gave him a link id like to see what he has to say right now i encouraged him to post a positive comment at the rfc but he wasnt supportive enough to do that just to allude that he might later 
 i saw where you added references that actually are just footnotes or comments while im not sure about the importance of the barony in which an irish town lies in any case a secondary source would be better than just a footnote that isnt really verifiable by the average reader do you know where to find one 
 i agree they are being given entirely too much prominence in marginally related articles as i have already pointed out here laurel lodged proposed developing dedicated articles on the baronies of ireland which seems to me a more constructive approach they are no longer of sufficient importance as to appear in article leads on towns and villages my attempts to suggest as much earlier have been largely ignored 
 i must disagree with the two assessments above firstly the unit of land called a barony has not been aboloshed the barons in the republic of ireland are gone and have no place their titles are now purely honorific the baronies on the other hand still retain legal force particularly in matters of probate and property rights all old title deeds will usually refer to the barony as you know possession is nine tenths of the law why would you want to write off such a major fraction so glibly secondly the contributions of rashers have not been ignored his erroneous assertions have been refuted thats not the same thing as ignoring them furthermore in the interests of peace i proposed a sensible compromise that would reduce the header prominance of the barony while retaining the info elsewhere for those interested in pursuing it i received no response to this proposal it was for this reason that it was necessary to put the additional information elsewhere the reference section seemed most sensible i have no objection to a new section of notes being added though it appears a touch of overkill lastly i have begun my work on the baronies of ireland i invite your contributions to the article eliogarty 
 nothing i said has been arefuted such prominence in the lead is inappropriate and nothing more than a distraction the arcane practice of retaining the names of these former administrative districts in title deeds has no legal bearing where land boundaries are now accurately surveyed the precise limits of the baronies are largely unknown due to movement of stream courses ditches and other longgone physical features they are of some historical interest and their study can shed light on the development of civil and ecclesiastical parishes and as a possible reference to older ownership but lets not get carried away 
 you dont like refute would rebut be a more accurate description 
 not really as a reader as much as an ed here id love to see those baronies articles developed systematically particularly interested in iffa and offa east if you and others get around to it i will be as supportive as i can in the work on those but please take on board the modest request not to force them into established articles 
 you still refuse to engage with the substantive issue with my peacemaking compromise your original grounds of objection have largely disappeared all that remains is to decide what to do with the explanatory note lets remind ourselves what is now at issue here the insertion of N words your proposal may be modest but it is not reasonable your continued objections not backed up by reasoned argument smack more of pique than a desire to maintain encyclopediaic consistency 
 thank you for quoting the agf it is quite apt in the current impasse for instance many new users who lack an intuitive grasp of wikipedia customs are gradually brought around once the logic behind them becomes more clear if only you would oblige by supplying the logic rashers then perhaps this new user could be brought around 
 i was not aware of a wider dispute maybe we should choose a more central location for our discussion perhaps 
 agree as regards moving to 
 it appears those people dont seem to think much of tom harrison eitheroh well 
 the link is not working for me i get a forbidden N error is this the same article that i saw earlier that was mainly concerned with morton 
 i read it last night it was a tedious analysis of how the word pull got changed to push in some article and at the end he tracks the edit down to tom harrison big conspiracy psyops blah blah blah 
 i just wonder why the link isnt working did alex jones take the page down or is it just me it didnt really seem to be about mongo but mainly morton and tom truthers must be desperate now if this article is the best they can do 
 i see now that both links are giving a N error the file permissions have been changed unfortunately no hits at webarchive on those urls another user has reported to me by email that they cant get them either the first story was an attack on morton and mongo the second one was sort of an update that names tom 
 curious why you removed the deletion notice at 
 simple mistake sorry 
 hey gt i just wanted to thank you for your good sense of humor patience and enthusiasm for helping resolve disputes i have not yet personally achieved a 
 ah you think i have a sense of humor baseball bugs might disagree at any rate if this is nirvana i dont want to know what want to know what 
 hmmm settle for this 
 back to the topic of baronies im still unsure about their importance the 
 agree there is plenty of scope for these articles to be developed at their dedicated locations 
 you try to mentor him and he turns on you perhaps you have heard the old saying no good deed goes unpunished 
 your negativity is as unwelcome as you can possibly imagine dont talk to me if you are going to do this i told my page was a respect zone are you going to respect that boundary your negativity is not welcome here 
 in my honest esitmation you bring more harm to the project than badagnani does by your unwillingness to eschew the sniping barbed hurtful poisonous remarks your sense of humor would be infinitely better if you left out the spite 
 i try to get you to laugh and you turn on me just as badagnani turned on you fine hes yours see ya 
 dont try to get me to laugh by disparaging someone im currently putting my emotion on the line to work with duh would you hang out in a classroom and mock the students expecting the teacher to appreciate that thats not the kind of support i need im not trying to be a dick but come on 
 why are you getting emotional about it dont let him get to you dont let me get to you dont let anyone get to you or they win be strong and remember its not lifeordeath its only wikipedia 
 you have no idea you cant see into my soul i know its not life or death but i also know that im here to make the world a better place and that i strongly believe in the idea of blessed are the peacemakers i try to be one of those i try to get opposing parties to respect each other and i have received positive feedback for doing this in the past from my perspective and i welcome correction you are injecting disrespect into situations where im quite voluntarily and freely investing some of my real feelings in my doing this is not a crime and i know how to control it that doesnt mean that i appreciate humor that derides someone with whom im trying to work i really am a teacher this is how i make a living if you start making fun of one of my students im not going to appreciate it and if i did id be a shitty teacher thats sure as hell extratrue if you do it somewhere they can hear or read it later im a grown up and i can decide just how much i want to invest where i can decide when i want to take on a student who requests it and when i want to try and convince someone of something whether or not they are willing i appreciate your respecting me enough to let me set my own boundaries when i told you this page was a respect zone i thought it was clear what that meant i like funny stuff i like really outthere offcolor bizarre humor i just dont use it to make fun of people im trying of my own free will to help is that unreasonable 
 im beginning to think our different approaches to humor is a generational thing 
 i was born in N i dont buy that its a generational thing when im in the context of dealing with someone who has fragile emotions and needs delicate handling im not going to appreciate remarks disparaging them that they can see i dont think you are too old or too young to recognize that one can be funny without insulting or disparaging anyone the best comedians i know of from any generation manage to do it 
 yes definitely a generation apart i come from a time when humor was a lot more roughhewn which is something i have been called also and thats fine we all have our different approaches you take the kinder gentler approach i take the approach of bringing them out sometimes your approach works sometimes mine works 
 does that mean you can respect where im coming from im not sure i know what bringing them out means but is it something thats done via humorous insults i tend to deal with people who are not prepared for that and with whom that is a bad idea do you generally consider who your audience is or not 
 sure i can your approach is just different its the schoolteachers approach which requires a great deal of patience my approach is much more blunt to try to figure out where they are coming from which sometimes requires pushing them a bit and then once their pentup emotion is released hopefully we can negotiate 
 to god best and greatest under the protectection of saint audoen 
 to god one and three under the protection of st francis xavier ihs does not mean i have suffered as is commonly suppoed instead it means iesus hominum salvator 
 id be gussing at this one but my best effort is dedicated to god best and greatest under the protectection of saint nicholas bishop of myra 
 excellent thanks i have another N or N that i will dig out i will put these on their respective pages 
 this is the first thing i have ever had to say on wikipedia and i hope i have done it right thanks for your forbearance and for listening and happy holidays to you 
 i personally dont think the article is in poor enough shape to need a full rewrite but certainly the structure is somewhat messy with plentiful statements lacking cites or poorly cited where sourcing should be improved or the statement removed the spammers and wearethegreatesthospital promoters have been kept down for the most part but its an ongoing battle regards and happy holidays 
 im tempted to do it myself but wanted to ask you about it first 
 dont think that i can rotate it without breaking it feel free to rotate if you can do so safely 
 i just rotated it N degrees thats still not straight but i think its at least better agree if not the old version is still there in the file history on the commons 
 thats fine thanks 
 just to let you know that i straightened this image and replaced it on the two sites as fileimperial palace on the palatine overlooking the circus maximusN jpg 
 i like the marx brothers movies for example but i wouldnt want them in the room where im trying to mediate a dispute between upset parties i dont think that makes me a prudish bore nor an overly politicallycorrect tightass 
 curious bugs arent you in your early N s 
 thirteen and a half 
 hmmin rabbits year how much do i multiply your humoring is those of high teens or college students but articles that you edit seems to be popular for seniorsso the gap is too deep or rabbits tend to live up for N ~N years so you are incarnated N times 
 senior citizen vs high school hmmm age and maturity are not the same thing lets just say im chronologically somewhere between those two extremes 
 meanwhile i note your comment that generosity and admonishment do not work so far another way to put that is good cop and bad cop have both failed now every case is different so im only speaking hypothetically here not about this particular case in some cases where neither good cop nor bad cop will get the job done there is regrettably only one alternative well maybe two both involve sending someone over to the hypothetical editors house for a little visit one option there would be my cousin vito who unlike me seriously lacks a sense of humor the other option would be to send an insurance salesman over regrettable yes but tough situations can call for some tough love 
 thanks im just editing or changing the infoboxes at the moment but intend to edit them all throughout some need more attention that others 
 i would not place a lot of reliance of the labels on that map such things are often dumbed downN for modern eyes id like to do some more research into the name for the moment i note that the catholic encyclopedia describes it as follows at the synod of kells N cardinal paparo gave a pallium to donat olonergan of cashel and since then his successors have ruled the ecclesiastical province of munster id place a lot of trust in this source but will dig elsewhere 
 im pretty sure the irish catholic bishops conference website is quite reliable and the labels on the map are correct on the page mentions kilfenora is in the province of cashel but the bishop of galway and kilmacduagh is its apostolic administrator the catholic encyclopedia has a number of pages about the ecclesiastical provinces the most prominent one is the page the catholic encyclopedia also has the page which if you scroll down you will see the ecclesiastical province of cashel another source published in N mentions province of armagh or cashel or dublin or tuam throughout the book so you will different sources use the term ecclesiastical province 
 ok im convinced cashel it is 
 i find the idea that my sense of humor is kinder and gentler rather absurd some of my favorite jokes are among the most offensive i can imagine i like 
 i said or meant to say that your approach is kinder and gentler not necessarily your sense of humor which from your description is too far out for my tastes but thats ok whatever works for you 
 well in that case i hope you didnt take any offense 
 i have not taken offense at anything you have said to me or if i did at the moment it didnt last long enough that i can recall it now 
 good do you understand why im a bit prickly if you drop off humor that would likely people with whom im trying to do delicate mediation work diplomats do not generally make fun of the upset parties between whom they are trying to broker peace thats been true since a long time before you were born right there is a time and a place for rough hewn humor and theres a time and a place for handling matters delicately i hope you will trust me to distinguish between those two cases and to try and respect that distinction on my talk page im not asking for much if you want to make me laugh just do it in any way that doesnt look like disrespect for people im trying to help there are millions of funny things to say that dont disparage anyone here i dont think this is a weird or unfair request am i being reasonable 
 and never lose sight of the fact that wikipedias primary purpose is to inform the public that goal is more important than nursemaiding difficult users the public could not care less about the internal soap operas here they come to wikipedia to learn information 
 come on do you imagine for a second that this isnt constantly in my mind how about a little more credit bugs maybe just maybe i have a clue what im doing if badagnani were not contributing a lot of good content i wouldnt be trying to help him however if you think im nursemaiding difficult users then you fail to understand what im doing thanks for the vote of confidence why are you talking to me seriously are you trying to help me why are you nursemaiding this difficult user called gt why do you want to convince me that badagnani isnt worth helping i will keep my own counsel about when thats true do you not trust me to set my own boundaries and maintain them why 
 from word one i have been raising issues that i think you need to consider whether you actually do consider them or not is up to you 
 well i do consider whats said im not sure that you realize that i have thought this stuff out pretty well if i seem to reject your suggestions its because i have considered them and i have considered my own beliefs about the world and about other people i trust my beliefs more than i trust that you are fit to advise on the topic of dispute resolution i have never seen you resolve a dispute maybe you are quite the diplomat i dont know i havent seen it what do you want to bring about how do you want me to change and why should i change based on your wants shall i accept you as an authority on how i should behave why so far all the suggestions i have seen you make have amounted to dont bother to try and make this situation better gt dont bother to try and help badagnani gt dont bother to follow your own conscience and ideals gt dont bother to try and learn as much as you can about how disputes work and how we can find ways out of them dont bother be more cynical and pessimistic maybe i should be reading something different from your suggestions but thats how they have been coming across to me if thats not what you are saying then maybe you havent been entirely clear if that is what you are saying then i say get thee behind me i believe in things you cant change that 
 heres the basic question when i defend wikipedia articles such as sarah palin and barack obama against povpushing marauders and then get told that that work is not important and that the important thing is to coddle those people what am i supposed to think what am i supposed to do why do some people here think that wikipedia is about nursemaiding belligerent users rather than being about providing content for the general public what can i do to help fix that problem if anything 
 so you still think im nursemaiding thats too bad if you have got a problem with specific people of specific articles then i can help i cant answer your question in the abstract because that would imply that so many situations are clear cases of black and white good editors versus difficult editors i dont buy it things are more complicated than that so you ask me what you are supposed to think you ask me what you can do i have got an answer take the moral high ground do it right let others help you and lets get there i am available to help with any situation that comes up otherwise im a goddamned hypocrite to give anyone advice about anything you think theres an easy answer there isnt if you want to help fix the problem dont be a part of the problem dont be someone who is willing to simplistically judge other editors as difficult join me in the struggle to get everyone on board dont tell me that my ideals are worthless or i will hate you forever and dedicate my life to proving you wrong now if you say that anyone claims that the important thing is to coddle these people i dont believe you point out anyone who has said that ever if you cant then stop lying i sure as fuck never say it stop portraying my position as some kind of spineless mindless mollycoddling nobody advocates that you want to help let me help you dont give me your fucking jaded cynical these people vomit there are no these people we are one species trying to survive if you want anything from me lead me to situations where i can help in an actual context dont try to pump overgeneralized shit about nursemaiding into my ears step up with some courage and some honesty and lets get to work on these problems im standing here with a goddamned shovel saying let me help you in the trenches and your reply is to come back with lazyassed cliche bullshit platitudes about whos worth working with and who isnt grow a fucking pair and show me where the problem is and lets work on it if you are not willing to fight to the motherfucking death to be part of the solution then i never want to hear anything from you again is that clear enough 
 i have told you before where i needed help and your answer was that my efforts are not important so we are done here 
 so you are still talking because yeah thats what i thought see ya 
 oh whatever you claim to have told me was lost among your attempts at humor if you want to communicate clearly practice 
 hi er which bio do you think could use a little of my majic 
 i will join you in the bio a little later this was one heck of a marine i noticed that you have also been working on other bios 
 dont forget to take a look at 
 as you will know the civil parishes dont appear to exist anymore in the republic of ireland i dont know about northern ireland so what i have been doing is creating subcategories in 
 we could try i was thinking asking advice from 
 having now created those subcategories in 
 the 
 i have now completed the transition from state list to articles on scouting in each state as per 
 thanks for letting me know about filling in some blanks on 
 hi i see you have been adding baronies in to the lead section of towns in ireland i must disagree with putting this information in the lead baronies are obscure medieval divisions which have been defunct for centuries they have no legal status unlike counties if you are going to put in baronies then you could put in the ancient gaelic kingdoms as well by all means the baronies should be mentioned in the history section of the article just not the lead as it could give the misleading and incorrect impression that baronies have legal status in ireland for example when you look at an us town it will give the county then state then country see 
 the purpose of the inclusion of the barony is not to give a pretended legal validity to the barony it is to assist the reader in identifying the location this can often be very important for the smaller entities where townlands of the same name exist in the same county only the barony can distinguish them so they serve a useful purpose in the descending order of geographical hierarchy which you yourself commend you will note that in all cases where i use it i give the triple explanation from barony to county to state in decreasing degrees of specificity this is particularly useful for those readers pursuing genealogical research from overseas in many cases the records from ellis island for example will include the barony 
 i have to disagree with you there baronies are really obscure and i doubt it would be of assistance in identifying a location more likely to confuse readers using barony with county and state does imply they have a legal status as i said by all means mention them in the history section where any reader who wants can find them but just not in the lead as we dont agree on this issue i will open a discussion on the irish notice board to get more views and input 
 im contacting yourself and some other uninvolved editors to see if you would be willng to read through an rfc at the article rescue squad it will be far from the most glamourous use of your time but it will help us see if we have reached a decision on this issue i think the discussion has died down and concensus has been reached but another user has posited im misreading this for the moment i have left my comments in the motion to close and collapsed template in place but if others agree there is no consensus im fine removing or reworking them the 
 i will have a look at this when im back online later tonight 
 alistairmcmillan i have been a bit busy but meaning but to leave this for a while im unhappy with the fact that you did research on me personally to try to undercut my position on the wikipedia article for sputnik webbrowser and i think you shouldnt do it to anyone else in the future i gather from the casualness of your response and other articles you referred to that you have done this to other editors in the past i think you should stop it is contrary to 
 typing someones name into google to see whether they are the developer of the software that they have just created an article about to see whether the article in question is yet another advertising or vanity software article is evidently evil im surprised im allowed to walk the streets unsupervised 
 for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria 
 i note your comment on my talk page regarding this article and i have no wish to be in any way unhelpful but can you demonstrate personal notability of this subject i see that members of his family have achieved varying degrees of significance but in wikipedia a person is not regarded as notable merely for having a notable relation if you feel able to address this aspect let me know and i will restore the article if you are uncertain may i suggest that you recreate it in a in your userspace where it can be improved at your leisure 
 forced to delete it again their own website says that they were born in the rich pastures of north tipperary and living in limerick this falls short of mentioning nenagh other sources mention puckane a photograpg of mr corrigan in a cbs negagh uniform may exist upon production of this of other proof this deletion could be reversed hearsay evidence is no evidence 
 i have been offline for a week or so there was a death in the family and concerns other than wikipedia have been pressing i will look at this situation and tell you what i think truthiipower schrandit hi 
 im sorry to hear about the death in the family i have been through that several times in recent years and it never gets any easier regarding truthiipower i will save you some time he was proven to be a sock of spotfixer which is what schrandit was alluding to and both user ids are now indefblocked 
 i would prefer not to see you here baseball bugs this page is not mine i know but your input so far has been so negative and unwelcome that i want to leave wikipedia when i see you post here if your goal is to make me feel worse about this project then by all means keep helping out here on my talk page 
 you and i are never going to see eyetoeye on the subject of how to handle users you are of the new school that says everyone can be saved i am of the old school that says everyone is already saved or lost before they get here my highest priority here is to try to defend wikipedia content your highest priority here apparently is to try to make troublesome users into productive users thats a noble and very challenging effort in any case we operate under different philosophies and thats just the way it is 
 i do not believe that everyone can be saved you are wrong about my beliefs you are wrong about my priorities i dont care that you are wrong but you are wrong my top priority is the encyclopedia and its content 
 then we agree that content is the top priority so please stop accusing me of being negative when i take a stance to defend content 
 and speaking of negativity i offer a condolence and your response is effectively fu 
 what i mostly want is for you to leave me alone baseball bugs i disagree with your methods of defending content the negativity of your methods will hurt content more than it help it in the long run in my opinion we disagree i will keep my own counsel as to whether your methods are negative enough for me to call them that now please leave me alone please take me off your watchlist i wont bother you either thank you 
 having just reread your comments from a week ago and while taking into account the possibility that you were going through personal anguish and that i was a good vent for it i find your own comments to be more negative and far more vile than anything i have ever said or done here in short i find your own comments to be thoroughly offensive so dont you dare ever lecture me about negativity again and now im done watching your page 
 im really not interested in lecturing you im happy just to note that we disagree and to see you go im happy to know that you feel good about your input and see me as hypocritical or wrong or whatever i wish you the best goodbye 
 no problem glad to help let me know if you run into more trouble 
 you actually went through all my contributions to revert them how petty 
 no just thorough you reverted my change to carrickonshannon with a comment saying no changes should be until the outcome of the discussion then you go ahead and make changes why is it one rule for me and another for you everyone abides by the same rules anything else is the height of hypocrisy 
 just to let you know that im not reverting your edits for the sake of it but 
 ok my mistake 
 back in july you were a model of efficiency using awb to strip out just curious not to seem demanding i hope would your technical abilities and or or oldschool industry be sufficient to the job of restoring those templates where removed in the wake of 
 if you think thats a useful avenue perhaps you can take it to 
 im glad that sounds usefulit really only occurred to me in the course of replying to you here so does backlog mean you think you will pursue that eventually or would it make more sense for me to go to somewhere like 
 thanks you are a true wikipedia public servant 
 hi can you explain why you are removing various tipperary castles from the category 
 yes they are castles and yes they are in tipperary why the move to follow through on the agreement in wikiproject ireland this agreement centred on the question of the merger of the N dublin categories the decision was to not do this but to create N new categories for each of the admininistrative jurisdictions of the former 
 see response on my talk page to repeat i now understand the reasoning however culture in north or south tipperary is probably not sufficiently specific a cat to be used for categorising architectural sites rather than just blanket removing the existing cats i would suggest its worth creating the north or south riding equivalents 
 just because such categories exist in other counties is hardly sufficient reason to impose them of all counties is it like i said im not averse to the creation of such categories in the future in principle but they take time to create all help would be gratefully received but right now the sparcity of the population does not warrent them and yes a low population count really is a sufficiently strong reason to stop the creation of zombie categories willynilly they will quite happily sit in culture until or if they find a more suitable home 
 hey i saw you moved the backlog header up after id reset it to seven days could you put it back please no need to reopen any discussions you closed of course see 
 oh im sorry i didnt see that i will put it back 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or for bringing lucidity and sense to a difficult discussion 
 why thank you im glad to know i am making sense to someone other than myself 
 id have to agree with this while my position on the issue in question is not the same as yours your intelligent and logical presentation of your thoughts as well as your professional and reasoned choice of words has prevented that thread from degenerating into petty nonsense as so many similar threads have 
 again a similar question why is it that you have decided to remove the national monuments in south tipp category from the 
 hey having looked at the history i think the removal may have just been a mistake have restored for now let me know if i have got it wrong and theres an argument to remove that im not seeing 
 yes just got a little deletehappy its tiring working alone on this 
 i dont know how much more of your trolling harassment i have to take for you to get the message so im making it clear stop trolling me next step is an or i 
 this is in response to the users null edit message with an apology and note that hes going his separate way it takes two to agree to disagree and gtbacchus has already done so uN 
 i have never had a sincere apology taken as trolling before i dont know what to say i clearly screwed up badly and i have already disengaged i was taught to apologize when i know i was wrong and im going to continue to live that way 
 gtbacchus you are a saint 
 no no im quite the sinner thanks though i might as well have known that there was no point talking to him i did genuinely believe he might hear something from me but i never know how to pitch my tone with someone whose own approach is so abrasive sometimes they respond well to bluntness sometimes that areally doesnt work by the time of my last post which provoked this i was genuinely trying to apologize and go away without the disruption of leaving a message he would have to delete it backfired but whatever this isnt the kind of situation that finds my skin thin when someone really freaks out on me i stay pretty calm arent we a funny species if i learn from this that will be good work heres hoping the important issue has nothing to do with me or thuranx id like to know whether wikipedia is going to develop some smartness about what trolling really is and how to deal with it right now we have got everyone each working from his or her own personal theory and i dont think we can all be right 
 if somebody were in your shoes s or he might have naturally gone to report his extreme incivility to ani or wqa so you are indeed very patient of such insults well i thought last summer how come the guy is not sanctioned yet for such behaviors but well my thought was proven right 
 yeah the page 
 please stop nominating tipperary categories for speedy deletion you cannot unilaterally impose a northsouth tipp division without a discussion especially not when the allireland final is on 
 oh the joys of wireless editing N eye on the tv the other on wiki the debate has already happended on wikiproject ireland see the split dublin thread there was a consensus to split it into its constituent counties by analogy the same authorisation is true for the N tipps anyway the way to appeal a speedy deletion request is to use the hang on function unilateral reversion of such a request is sooooooooooooooooooo not proper wiki protocol anyway tipp is winning 
 can you point me to that split dublin thread i couldnt find it (unless you mean 
 the consensus was not to merge dublin city with county dublin thats not the same thing at all 
 hey as you are probably aware im the oneman army comprising the vast majority of the editing activity on the john frusciante articleuN which despite that selfcompliment isnt a good thing i have got fa satus in the crosshairs but unfortunately there are things that i cant do seeing as how you are like the lord of all things chili peppers on wikipedia i think you can help me i need help adding images and soundclips to the article this is the one thing that i cant handle on my own i noticed that you added an image to the article which indicates that you have the wherewithal to upload articles if you are unwilling to aid me in this area then i will understand and go harrass someone else for help here but seeing as how you share my love for frusciante and you are one of the only actively devoted chili peppers editors i can find i think this is worth a shot 
 oh and about my by the way commentsuN is it my responsibility to cross out the qualms i listed that have been fixed or is that yours 
 i reverted your recent edits to the frusciante article the last thing i want to do is seem like im practicing 
 cool im going to stop being paranoid about offending people now it goes against my true persona do you have a take on what needs to be done in order to get the frusciante article to fa the only thing i can really think of is the addition of more pictures and a style and influences section i think the biography section is pretty tight right nowuN sans the current projects section which should be sourced and possibly expanded 
 so you have a N strat and a N jaguar thats sweet are they original or replicas 
 i have a fairly new epiphone les paul that i have had for a about N months its probably the nicest guitar epiphone makes i bought it from a guy on ebay who hung it on his wall and never played it so what did you pay for your guitars im not in a band yet but im looking for one 
 do you have the kataweb article that you referenced jensen removed it for being an unclear reference but if i can verify its validity and clarify the reference we will put it back up 
 i very much appreciated the logic of your explanation that iar is not a logical paradox because it is not an exercise in formal logic 
 thanks it took us a few years to get the idea down to that few words its certainly been a fun idea to help incubate and develop wikipedia is a remarkable kind of system like they say it doesnt work in theory only in practice 
 feel free to let me know if i can help you use the site in any way 
 there are too many days in the 
 replied there thanks for the headsup 
 hey back on the ref desk you mentioned you were making a catalogue of living creatures found in your house can i get a list of those things thanks 
 i replied at your page come to think of it i might as well just post it as a subpage here lets see 
 actually translating it from notepad++ into wikimarkup seems to be nontrivial i might try to figure this out later 
 laurel i think you should start a discussion about this before going any further you recently two edits of mine to the north or south tipperary categories and the reason you gave was that the point is to empty as much of tipp as possible so that north tipp can assume its place you seem to have made this decision without consulting anyone and as you can see there are editors who are against it i suggest you take the matter to 
 i dont agree that im acting unilaterally as mentioned above i assume that the consensus decision on the N dublin county councils authorises me to undertake the same actions for the N tipperary county councils which are in exactly the same situation i agree with the earlier editor who notes that the subcategories of the new dublin cats are poorly populated i should point out that i complained loudly about the word effort that would be required to give effect to the concensus decision knowing right well that it be a slow and painful exercise i got nothing but the deaf ear from all concerned so instead of complaining about poor populations go and do something positive shift a page from dublin to fingal lastly fastily above supports my interpretation of policy i see no reason to take the matter elsewhere and hope that other editors wil not engage in forum shopping 
 exactly how many users do you think have implicitly endorsed your course of action reading back over that dublin discussion scriveneruki proposed creating subcategories and you seem to have abandoned your initial merge proposal and supported this nobody suggested deleting categories peterkingiron explicitly mentions preserving the supercategory im not sure which other contributors you assume agree with your putative consensus most comments were made before scriveneruki had made the suggestion i note that mike selinker concluded the result of the discussion was no consensus in any case nobody mentioned deleting categories and two users have now explicitly opposed this 
 hey i am hoping you can find an image of the butler arms trying to make it pretty i have got some others up at 
 actually im not a butler but i have spent some time looking for their arms with no luck so far 
 they probably wont be colored but im sure the arms of the ormonds can be found in any number of old books at archiveorg for example in various editions of burkes and similar sources once downloaded you can open whichever pdf in adobe grab the image then paste it into another program to make the file then upload that to wikimedia alternatively google books will make the image file for you but it will be lower quality 
 ok will try that approach meanwhile up tipp 
 i see that debbieleN has the maintenance tags about blp and primary sources that were originally placed there you had if you think that the tags still belong on that article you might consider opening a discussion on the talk page i still have the article on my watch list due to a previous complaint at 
 hi ed i restored the tags just on general principles when they were were again removed without explanation i also came to the article from wpcoin i have no specific interest in the subject matter after looking at the improved state of the article im okay with the tags off editor debbieleN may need a short block to get her attention best 
 and she continues to add copyrighted material without any need to the articles theres no reason not to have at least the main article on wikipedia except that editor debbieleN who appears to be an intern at the magazine copies from the web and pastes it into wikipedia and is beginning to prove a reason not to have the articles on wikipedia its hard to believe that these college students and graduates dont know a thing about plagiarism 
 maybe she got her start in the interning racket at 
 i could use your advice on this has been moving articles for several years but either doesnt seem to understand the concept or wont go to the talk page to propose the move first many of his moves have been contested and reverted im wondering what is the best way to deal with this obviously i dont want to upset him 
 does reverting his moves provoke any conflict does he fight or argue over it 
 its possible but in my case no his talk page has several incidents that you can pour over and hes been asked to stop the moves at least once its really weird because i have never seen a serial bad mover before except for the obvious vandalism 
 i have moved the material to 
 the old reverse takeover trick eh its just crazy enough to work still i cant help but feel that you would benefit from communication skills N class at the risk of pot calling kettle black some advance sign posting of intentions would go a long way to avoid conflicts before they even start tedious i know but sometimes more efficient in a wider social setting such as this hive 
 what did i do to you not only was that person making vague allegations but he was also messing up the article with bad copyediting of my stuff and crazy oversectioning then he starts using the talk page to lecture me and point to his further lecturing of me on my talk page this after pulling some near canvassing on two other talk pages i know about it would be great if he and that other guy knew anything about anything but they dont they are just there trying to look special so never mind laurel i dont need you 
 i have no personal issue with you dd i was just offering some friendly advice based on bitter personal experience its yours to take or to leave you may well be right about the others N editors but thats not the point theres no point in winning the intellectual battle if you end up losing the communication war your personal style was starting to come between you and some good articles no man is an island as the poet says so its no harm to invest a little time in communicating the grand plan its time well spent in the long run peace be with you 
 as i have now said there laurel there really is no point those two guys who are lightweights wont be going for the sources and probably wont even stick around for long i know for sure finn who is a good scholar wont stay interested he never does for long i bothered to visit you because you are genuinely interested 
 i think the thread seems to be on ani forever because viritidas obviously does not want to let the thread go she thinks commenting the last is winning reading her constant attacking and harassing editors who disagree with her view on the situation is very tiresome and horrendous i think you can archive the tread by using archivetop if somebody wants a new discussion on him or her then so be it however as i said you earlier i believe the unnecessary extended thread led badagnanis block what is she doing i have never seen such weird mentorship anyway would you archive it thanks 
 disparaging any other editor is not a good way to get what you want from me you are sounding more and more like badagnani i will see if i can figure out how ani archiving works now its a subpage and i dont know if that changes anything 
 the user has intentionally used my previous ani reports filed by sockpuppeters or spi in order to attacked other editors even though i have ceased talking with her so since viritidas is breaching civility violation she does not deserve my respect at all moreover didnt she disparage me on your talk i believe the report on ani that has been for an excessively long period is humiliation to badagnani regardless of the matter being resolved or not anyway thank you for stepping in 
 i have replied to your email if you have issues with viriditas i recommend following 
 thank you for the kind and prudent advice i dont think the thread is about badagnani any more so expending the thread over and over only affects badagnanis reputation badly as i said many times i have an ambivalent feeling about him because i had good and bad days with him and had tried to work together with him vice versa when you suggested me to request a rfc on badagnani twice i did not do that however viriditas does only see what she wants to see i dont think dr with her is worthy for my time unlike badagnanis case because i do not work nor wish to work with such editor i still have to work with badagnani regardless whether he changes himself or not on the other hand i have many disagreement with childofmidnight on badagnanis editing but we are good together because we do not breach civility i dont think viriditass behavior helps badagnani i have tried to not encounter her for now i think that is a best way for me 
 i dont think viriditas has taken his or her own advice about how to catch flies nor has viriditas been entirely consistent in approaching the situation as for seeing what one wants to see i think we are all guilty of that on occasion that said i would tend to agree that viriditas is not helping badagnani im not sure anyone can help badagnani until badagnani decides to accept help if you are able to avoid viriditas then that sounds like a good idea 
 thanks again i believe you would finish up your semester very well because of your goodness to editors 
 i see that you moved south west trains to 
 i came across this and have moved the page back to 
 if as you say that comma disambiguations are for locations only can you explain to me why the examples cited above are not read instead as southern railway great britain and southern railway us 
 because i meant that comma disambiguations are used to disambiguate locations (
 i dont agree with your edits concerning these two titles there is a system in place for peerage articles when a peer holds a number of subsidiary titles these articles are redirects to the substantive title for instance 
 i have replied on your talk page in summary id favour the second option 
 orderinchaos why have you reverted my edits 
 there have been persistent problems at the ge page with employees of his pr company trying to modify the article in ways which contradict 
 orderinchaos i am dean walters geoffrey edelstenuN s pr representative and i assure you that i nor geoffrey edelsten have been editing this page until this day is there any policies i should be aware of because i do not believe i have overstepped the mark by fixing a reference and adding an external link what do you advise 
 orderinchaos i am geoffrey edelstens pr representative and i nor geoffrey have been editing this article in question until this day i wish to make edits to the geoffrey edelsten article to bring balance geoffrey edelsten is concerned with this articles inaccuracy which reads to defame please advise how i may edit this article successfully that is without having it reverted if i can not make edits then what would you advise defamation is serious concern 
 orderinchaos can you please provide me your phone number so we may speak in more depth you can email me any time at dean@geoffedelstencomau thank you 
 no worries re yourself personally i am happy to take that on good faith i was always of the opinion that geoffrey himself was rather removed from the problems going on here if the facts as presented by 
 on a completely different tangent i am going to be away from here for about two days for various personal reasons i felt obliged to respond as i had taken action but i think i have said all i can at this point others will likely have their say on the articles talk page 
 how may i edit the geoffrey edelsten article successfully it is a major defamation concern much of the negative sources referenced in the article are wrong such as the case name your assistance is appreciated by the way of your tangent my condolences 
 like i said bring up proposed changes on the talk page try to convince editors they should be changed even if you dont get agreement on every point you may get several sticking points resolved that way ie incremental change so if a names wrong or if a details wrong and a reliable source can be found which asserts contrary to what is in the article provide the evidence for it i dont doubt you will get a few changes through that way and wikipedia will be the better for it a colleague of mine recently dealt with concerns relating to a politicians page and it turned out reliable sources were available for all sorts of things what happened in part in that case is that most of the negative coverage remained but we found lots of good things to say about the guy that were nontrivial and could be backed up 
 you are making various errors in categorisation 
 please dont manually empty categories and immediately tag them as eligible for speedy deletion this is not what the criterion is for it is for categories that have remained empty for N days essentially you are renaming categories without using the procedures of 
 everyones input is useful insofar as i get to see a broader crosssection im not familiar with this particular danish prince im unlikely to incorporate his advice verbatim into an essay but i know that some people do think that way and i would like to somehow address those people the trick is that the people who need the advice most are precisely those who are least likely to listen a good essay might be able to gain enough consensus for people to call it a guideline though as much as i like to disdain such reindeer games tinkering with the status of a page sometimes common sense needs all the leverage it can get 
 and i think im just now figuring out yeah im sticking by my guns hamlet gets the same answer anyone would 
 that is the question 
 gtbacchus i try to make the disclosure really obvious on hamlets user page think of him as the exiled prince from trollmarkthe antitroll hes the sort of fellow who tinkers away usefully on articles about trolls socks puppets and parodies of shakespeare alternatively think of him as the gentle humor of my alterego cheers 
 i was just about to that understanding hamlet will certainly be welcome to pitch in whenever i try and write down some of these thoughts in some format for general consumption i think his comments are already helping temper my quixoticity to an extent thats always helpful 
 quixotism 
 i like that it sounds like a form of autism slow nah hes got the quicks autism of course quixoticity sounds like a form of toxicity 
 that had crossed my mind theres normal autism then theres quixautism which leads to such bizarre behavior as obsessively counting the number of windmills tilting on the horizon 
 i go to the discussion page first 
 and 
 but then you decided to revert anyway wouldnt the polite thing be to get agreement on the discussion page before engaging in potential edit wars 
 i suspect that when you are dealing with a topic as fraught with controversy over the centuries as this one the polite thing to do would be to hold back on reapplying the category when its been removed by an editor until there emerges a consensus that the category does indeed belong 
 im afraid it is your own logic that is way off see discussion page on unification church the categories refer to those groups as christian which is how they describe themselves the categories meerly subdefine or ringfence that description 
 im not using logicuN im referring to the areal world and the way terminology is actually used in real life its all 
 did i create the pages 
 i think it might be a good idea if you become somewhat more familiar with wikipedia policies and procedures before you go allout in accusing others of character flaws when what they are doing is fixing your obvious mistakes that violate wp politicies 
 had you read the next paragraph of the article 
 i see goalposts shifting first i was guilty of a mistake of extending logic that has not worked out now the ground is shifting to reliable sources that charge is equally invalid and i will accept the name of any church under either question btw i deleted the offending remarks 
 i had assumed you were familiar with 
 i see you recently deleted a user page for active user 
 it was only after i posted the following message that i noticed the same issue had already been raised above however since i have posted it it may as well stay 
 also i have a solution for badagnani simply block him until he offers a solution for interacting with him if that solution doesnt work or it does not change his behavior then repeat until he either offers a solution that works or no one is willing to continue working with him 
 you know what that was it was a mistake for some reason i missed the datestamps nevertheless i dont really think you can say i was disrupting the talk page if you chose to reply to me there as for your badagnani solution he offers the same for dealing with you i cant tell that either of you is much better than the other as far as handling disputes here you find an admin willing to block him and that will be great im involved so i cant i wont overturn it until you can get someone to do that hes all of our problem if you want to tell me how to do my job become an administrator or at least successfully resolve some dispute meanwhile if i see you interacting with badagnani in an escalatory way i have little choice but to say something i hope you understand i will in the future be more careful about replying to threads that havent fallen quiet for weeks 
 besides we know that badagnanis problems have nothing to with me i just was one of the people that thought it best to do something about him given all the problems he causes many people when confronted with a difficult problem will attack the person for pressing that the problem be solved this is such a case 
 i have removed the discussion hope you dont mind 
 wouldnt it be better to discuss your concerns on my talk page instead that way you are not escalating the problem um have i not already done this what else can i do here we are what do you want from me public apologies and breastbeating when i say he offers the same for dealing with you i mean that badagnani offers the solution of blocking you while you suggest blocking him unless one of you seems more interested in dispute resolution i cant prefer one over the other besides we know that badagnanis problems have nothing to with me no we dont know that know is a very strong word i believe that those who suggest that badagnani is being harassed and hounded have a havery good point i see nobody in this conflict who has consistently worked towards resolution rather than escalation when i have suggested that you be more resolutionoriented you have blown me off i will cheerfully provide diffs if you dont remember you are either pursuing active diplomacy or you dont care about resolving disputes wikipedia is all about resolving disputes and not prolonging them how have you helped to resolve this one 
 by the way please stop disrupting this articles talk page thanks is a great thing to say to me if what you wish to communicate is i have zero respect for you gtb if thats not your message then talk to me differently if your goal is to destroy any possibility of working with me keep up with that tone seriously how were you not born knowing this 
 if thats not your message then talk to me differently its not my message i have removed the discussion i hoped we could move on can we move on 
 can you move on if not im happy to discuss what i meant i hope i have made it clear that i did not intend the meaning that you are so upset about 
 i need some time away from all of this i think i have been lashing out randomly so im going to walk away for a while keep the faith 
 i fully understand and respect that 
 thanks for your comments at the wqa report regarding myself (
 well i have to tell you when i saw his latest edit i was very tempted to just revert it the same as i would any vandalism but i couldnt think of an appropriate edit summary i know as a thirdparty observer i shouldnt get irked but i find him exasperating but i will just watch quietly and hope he will get bored or be blocked for disruption i still think its best not to feed him though best and happy new year 
 hi if you will post at 
 i have just added 
 because 
 per 
 the additionalal instructions were added om november N my question at 
 it was done in on N october which i have just reverted 
 if thought that the article was miscategorised you may have had grounds for recategorising the article but the category was correctly parented 
 i am quite concerned about what you did here which seems about as inappropriate as removing 
 re point N many people spend many years in ireland but that does not make them irish so domicile would not qualify for inclusion she may have been irelands bestknown abortionist but the category does not define itself as well known abortionists operating in ireland no information is presented in the article to say that she tok out irish citizenship the possibilility that she may have had a legal right to do so is not the same thing as saying she actully exercised that right nor does the article anywhewre assert that she exercised that right in the absence of such verifiable citations the prudent thing to do is to assume that no such exercise of potential rights took place to do otherwise would introduce or re point N anybody born in the usa at that time was automatically a us citizen this reqires no assumptions or or if you are unsure what criteria aware to citizenship then you should act accordingly that is do nothing when your level of certainty improves feel free to intervene and revert meantime the correct course of action is for you to revert your reversion 
 if you want a source the describes her as irish 
 not me gov find another scapegoat 
 im just trying to undo some of the many errors you have made in categorisation and to try to help you avoid these problems in future its a pity that you seem rather hostile to this 
 i will take on board that the special attention that has been lately lavished on me is for my own good meanwhile the childers thing is not down to me i went back over the edits of many months and failed to find my name 
 i didnt say that childers had been removed from the category i was just pointing out that by the mistaken logic you applied to cadden would apply much strongly to childers 
 i would be delighted to collaborate with you on an essay regarding identifying and effectively dealing with trolling let me know if you are interested or or 
 i might be interested anything i write will reflect my point of view of course some people think that i feed trolls and i think that they feed trolls its kind of fun 
 hey gtb how you doing these days hey i just wanted you to know that i started a thread concerning you and some help you may be willing to provide at 
 good luck buddy if anyone can you can uN 
 thanks 
 im sorry but im getting just a little fed up with your pov bluster and in general intimidatory approach to editing wikipedia articles not to mention personal attacks which you have made on me and other editors in the past i suggest you go back and read up what wikipedia is all about then take some time out to reflect before continuing 
 funny how no other editor seems to endorse your pov there has been only N other editor who has suggested a compromise between our positions and that compromise was largely agreeable to me and you are not shy when it comes to intimidatory editing either you never did come back with a proper justification for the civil parishes categories despite your own magnus opus of bluster and funnily enough no other editor has reverted their exclusions did it occur to you that the problem might lie with you and your pov 
 i endorse 
 please can you both assume good faith here and maintain civility 
 hey the changes i made work the image in infobox on the mcdonalds page just hadnt been update yet the alt text was the result of a copy and paste from the similar 
 you say the changes i made work but the changes you made did not work in the sense of producing a clean infobox until you changed the 
 fwiw you may wish to comment 
 thank you i have commented there 
 you are welcome uN and nbsp 
 your disruption of categories has been going on for too long see all the other documented miscategorisations on this talk page as well as all the categories which you emptied outofprocess please stop this now 
 re point N i disagree that roman catholic cathedrals in ireland is a national category a cathedral is just a subset of churches in general as such the children of that category roman catholic cathedrals in the republic of ireland and roman catholic cathedrals in northern ireland fit quite naturally into the paraent categories of roman catholic churches in the republic of ireland and roman catholic churches in northern ireland respectively but since you dont agree with this logic i will raise it at cfd 
 by the way im getting fed up with you assuming that my edits are motivated by a desire to be disruptive edits nited in N to N above are not miscategorisations they are simply categorisations with which you happen to disagree i think that you should take your own advice posted above please can youassume good faith here and maintain civility 
 i can well accept that an editor acting in good faith can do things with disruptive effect without having a disruptive intent but a good faith editor would take note of the fact that their ideas were repeatedly challenged and rejected by consensus and start trying to seek consensus beforehand if you dont want be perceived as deliberately disruptive then you know what to do ask first rather than complaining when you are reverted 
 i have what i think is a related question you may be able to answer for the link to alexander pantages i would like to go directly to the section pantages theatre circuit included in the alexander pantages wikipedia article i have a memory of seeing a way to do that but i havent been able to relocate the instructions again many thanks for your help 
 thank you very much for your suggestions and assistance all of which were very helpful 
 the 
 offers withdrawn the way the rationale was worded i took it that the main article was indeed omaha nebraska apologies 
 for what its worth there doesnt seem to be particularly strong consensus to delete user talk pages (cf 
 do you thats true in this particular case or just in general i was carrying out the users request more than trying to do what it says on a page somewhere but if people think im wrong i will undo it 
 actually i hadnt seen the discussion at 
 oh yeah it turns out i care thanks for taking the time 
 i dont know why you a bunch of lists from 
 the reason is very simple the category was an exact duplicate of 
 there would be no drama if you stopped your cycle of destructive recategorisations 
 unless you explicitly agree to the restrictions outlined above i will open a discussion on their enforcement as a community ban 
 i double dare ya the most likely outcome of this process is an upmerge decision at cfd to get rid of these silly mirror categories 
 any more edits by you to categories and i will do it 
 ll you could have started a debate on this on wikiproject ireland but instead you chose a combative approach how disappointing if you cant work with fellow wikipedia editors then perhaps you should withdraw from the project 
 the whole 
 if you dont like 
 another one where you removed 
 cant a girl make an honest mistake in a flurry of recategorisations after the dublin (cityN concensus a lot of the dublin county cats were removed this one was done by accident you should note that i got it right when i added 
 if this was oneoff error id 
 ( 
 there is nothing in 
 and as to your claim that a christian diocese belongs in 
 but your complaint was not about the category not the article i did nothing to the article it was the categories that i removed so since epon relates to the article then the rule is irrelevant in this instance no 
 no you did do something to the article these in which you removed 
 and yet another where you removed 
 i see nothing wrong with my categorisation the main article for the 
 categories should follow their eponymous article if you wish to change the scope of the article that should be discussed on the articles page i would imagine that only when agreement is reached there should one proceed to a change of scope of the category 
 laurel the scope of the category reflects reflects the scope of the topic not the current state of the head article 
 this seems to be a novel interpretation nothing that i have read in cfd would lead me to believe that categories reflects the scope of the topic asopposed to their expressed scope might be worthy of testing do you think 
 the scope of the topic is clearly expressed in the title of the category if you want to argue former principle that 
 thank you so you see most of my remarks are not meaningful but if one remark corrects an entry it is certainly worth it 
 we all say sorry a lot but then again often we do so only as a promise not to violate the mutuallyaccepted rules of civil discourse so that we may continue a conversation concerning a disagreement as my mother taught me everything i need to know i learned in kindergarten in that spirit there does seem to be a difference between an apology conceding a dispute and a promise to act better in the course of continuing some disagreement perhaps the ambiguity can be resolved by considering and performing one act as an apology the other as a promise 
 hi im not entirely sure what you are saying i mean all those sentences make sense but if you are describing what happened im not following i had an extremely unpleasant set of interactions with someone in which a lot of apologies were demanded of me and i found myself simultaneously attacked in various ways an apology was demanded of me that seemed to involve admitting to have said something i never said if thats the kind of apology that someone demands then i think its very fair to point out that the conditions demanded are at odds with reality if someone says apologize for purposely insulting me when i didnt purposely insult the person then where does this act of pure grace come in finally i have no idea what this means perhaps the ambiguity can be resolved by considering and performing one act as an apology the other as a promise what what promise can you be more specific and concrete because i have no idea whether you are criticizing me or what im sorry but i do not follow what you are saying and how it applies to the situation i assume you are talking about if you are offering advice can you make it clear id love to learn from this situation but this seems very cryptic 
 some might consider your efforts to continue to press a point in these circumstances the sort of behavior that is exhibited by assholes im certainly not one of them you tried too hard to defuse tensions with someone who was not in a mood to reciprocate and you tried too hard to clarify a point that this someone was tired of hearing moods change and a bit of time passing will make this go away 
 thank you i think you have managed to say what nobody else has to make me feel somehow understood thanks very much for that i have already stopped caring about whatshisname but i was still bummed out by the lack of human feeling from anyone here you have just made me feel a lot better about that and i thank you very much 
 what 
 what what i mean what 
 gbt i have been following your comments on bbugs with interest and found this one quite compelling i think that our community has managed to enable to the point of institutionalizing the most infantile and counterproductive ways of handling trolling i could not agree with you more having had two incidents with problem users in the past two weeks that onel reinfoce my belief that you are correct between july N and early N i had a long tiring battle with several trolls obviously there are going to be bad reactions in such situations but every time i said something i might have been better not to say and i few comments that i still stand by id get N admins slamming me immediately while doing absoultely nothing about the trolls is one of those infantile and counterproductive ways you mentioned as such i have now declared myself to be a troll in such situations and asked them to not feed me lets see how long it takes for me to be warned blocked or banned 
 thats interesting im not sure i know exactly what you mean but i know that this is a topic the community has not really ever talked about at least not in a way that led to any kind of consensus i wonder what do you think would be a smart strategy is it a question of identifying and stopping trolls or is it a question of finding a way to respond to all callers that will not reward trolling i find that we reward them quite a lot which seems wrong im pretty sure that calling them troll counts as rewarding them for example 
 never mind i think perhaps i misunderstood your original comment to mean the opposite of what you actually meant sorry in any case im moving on 
 hi i was just looking into the speedy deletion of 
 i have undeleted the image you can figure out for yourselves which one is right and list the other on ffd 
 cool thanks 
 concerning please see 
 yes it seems that we are in agreement on this point 
 are doing great deals at the moment look closer at the map on 
 very droll perhaps a footnote on the picture advising use of the hubble telescope might assist readers 
 true you do have to click on the map and expand it to see the deds i made it a bit bigger anyway 
 looking at 
 please do not add elections to categories for constituencies as you did and an election is not a type of constituency 
 dublin central is a constituency things that affect the constituency ought to be in the cat for the constituency elections affect constituencies its nonsense to say that elections to a constituency do not belong in the cat for constituencies 
 if this was 
 note was depopulated by you in these edits 
 why would local_councillors_in__tipperary have any entries there is no such county council as tipperary county council never has been the category cannot contain any articles it should be deleted 
 you have been warned dozens of times before that if you think a category should be deleted the way you should go about that is to nominate for deletion at 
 comment laurel is this really still a problem is there something about the regular procedures or practices that you do not understand i feel like i and others have done our best to spell out what should not be done and why but it doesnt seem to be making much difference are we missing something that you dont understand 
 okay i dont like the guy which is actually playing down how i feel about this particular user my comments were a little out of hand that said he isnt stupid he knows how his coming to an article i wrote to dismantle it is going to be perceived i mean the user didnt even bother going to the article discussion had they actually come to edit constructively they would have contributed to the discussion or added to the article using any of the dozen or so convenientlyresearched sources also located there at the very least the user is blind bull in a china shop at worst hes spoiling for a fight okay i shouldnt have reacted the way i did i felt a little provoked 
 hey you may be right maybe hes got problems however we have got to make sure that content disputes dont turn into personal disputes i mean if his behavior is really out of line there is recourse if you can handle it as a content dispute however thats better be assured that i have got my eye on the page now and other admins probably do too just keep your eye on the prize and if you need any help dealing with the other editor let me know 
 thanks for accepting my apology 
 all edits in this account are in 
 well it seems to be someone for sure i agree that these edits are not someones first exposure to wikipedia beyond that its hard to say much in a way it doesnt matter because the answer to the sourcing question doesnt depend on figuring out who this ip is 
 oh bte i checked and apparently grief porn is actually in the of urban dictionary fularious street slang defined this would seem to address the reliability issue right 
 it could id be inclined to ask around which we can do anytime of course i do most of my work in areas other than evaluating sources so im not necessarily up to date on best practices whats the refactoring issue exactly 
 is at least the one i noticed then there is the removal from different wikiprojects withoput discussion i am a big believer in discussion and none of it is really happening there 
 oh i see i thought you meant he was like editing your comments in a discussion or something i get it i dont really know anything about those templates they usually live on the talk pages of articles that have been featured in did you know right as for discussion im pretty sure we are having it now and i have also posted to the talk page there 
 yep they dont get removed as they are milestones for the article and the ediut summary voices disagreement with its awarding its like trying to edit an closed and archived discussion after the fact 
 i note you have reverted changes i made to counties of ireland articles which i made both to improve the flow and comply with imos you cited nonexisting consensus and imos in support of your reverts please be aware that such beheaviour is edit warring regards 
 follow the imos and leave your own pov out of it 
 well said sir the cheek of sarahN 
 may your archive old disscussions i cant read my own post ( 
 im going to have to get back to you tomorrow i will have a good look at this situation then 
 you cant break brd its not a law we havent got laws here what do you want most 
 and you should read brd for understanding as i was the one who was following it 
 which raises the question given that a revert is allowed when is it actually a good idea not always it turns out 
 yikes i would be careful with comments that equates knowledge about the serbian legal or government system with knowledge that crimes against humanity are bad 
 inflamatory remarks removed 
 i just didnt want another user to freak out on you about it i understood the point you were making but i figured it was dangerous ground 
 are anon ip users able to see their talk page my new best friend is now editing under a new ip i just finished linking them 
 still awaiting an answer gt 
 sorry i have been offline and now typing is difficult with this splint on my finger ip users certainly can see their talk page but it can be tricky to find it if someone else leaves them a message then they get the same orange banner we get but once thats gone they havent got the my talk link what i do when im editing anonymously and want to see my talk is go to some article i have edited look at the history and find myself that way does that answer your question 
 it does thanks and sorry about your finger a broken finger for me would be akin to a broken arm 
 sorry about your finger gtb i guess you overdid it on all the force directing 
 it must be that the doctor is convinced its a sports injury despite my protests that i havent done any kind of sports in the last n months where n is some large number i cant accept that its a typing injury and the doctor says no it couldnt have been cracking my knuckles that did it i dont know whether to trust my own account of events or the guy whos been to medical school thank you both for your kind condolences 
 well if it teaches you to stop cracking your knuckles then some good will come of it it drives me crazy when people do that cheers feel better and ummm make sure to take care of your health being N and however many years old you are not as young as you used to be 
 i guess my question is answered an ip user can see and comment their user talk page they just have to want to 
 i note you reverted my edit on 
 the one on wikiprroject ireland remember the N options none of them were per your reversions 
 no memory 
 cant go near the project i have more blocks than you have albeit for less legitimate reasons 
 ok then whats your problem with putting this in the lead is one of the 
 cant comment on that arbcom thingy 
 understood but whilst its still a thingy the status quo should be respected by you 
 thats what i was doing you reverted 
 not at all the consensus contained the above phrase per this consensus both roi and ireland feature in the lead satisfies both camps hence the consensus offends the least numbers no 
 no 
 we appear to have come to an impasse i have left a note on 
 the links are live again 
 according to pp prison planetcom hit by major hack attack the perpetrators could be trolls acting in response to our article about wikipedia censorship yesterday or they could be acting on behalf of all manner of government agencies that we have clashed with over the years lol 
 the alex jones crowd seems to be intentionally paranoid 
 per your comments on 
 im only online for a minute right now and this post is confusing me that thing about brd being invalid huh no i dont think that i dont oppose any of our usual policies so if something i said seems to indicate that then i must have been unclear when i have more time later i will be back and try to figure out what happened 
 im definitely not taking a side for one thing you will find that i am perfectly capable of criticizing those with whom i agree defending those with whom i disagree and arguing against reverting even when i agree with the edit i am absolutely not taking a side except for the side of what i consider to be best editing practices i will be perfectly happy to explain myself at length later this evening if you want to make edits that stick sometimes leaving the article in your nonpreferred version is a smarter strategy that will get you where you want to be faster than reverting will 
 i dont doubt that you did not intend to take a side but when your comments there consist solely of telling one side that they are in the wrong (the one actually following 
 i understand what you mean i sometimes am more quick to criticize a party who seems to be in the right if i think that they could be more effective its easier to get you on board it seems to me than to get idot on board i see that i criticized you without making what i was trying to say at all clear and i apologize for that whatever brd allows reverting is not always the smartest strategy sometimes you are much better off working from the other position and letting a bad edit stand for a while is a very powerful technique albeit a very nonintuitive one im pretty sure that the most successful editors follow a zerorevert rule i try to regarding brd theres the letter of it and theres the spirit the spirit is infinitely more important than the letter and this is true to the point that i would discourage editors from reading the letter at all once they get the spirit the spirit of brd is once theres been a single reversion everyone stop editing and talk that 
 i appreciate the rewrite of the talk page comment in question 
 not reverting bad edits with the hope that the editors will just give up and change their minds when its clear they dont have consensus is absolutely not what im talking about read my comments again keeping in mind that i didnt actually say anything that dumb im talking about getting a few ducks in a row and getting someone else to revert for you because its stronger from N editors than from N the strategy im suggesting is significantly more practical than reverting based on areal world results do what works not just what you figure might work 
 so i think you should undo your own recent edits that would be the proper way to take responsibility for misunderstanding the issue honestly i am not in the mood to go through another exercise of options at the ireland project the leads are not a huge deal but avoiding having to use republic of ireland should be pretty easy please do so for my part i think it reads better thanks uN 
 thank you for understanding that part however i have read and reread the archived discussion yet again this morning and there were only seven participants discussing the five greenboxed ideas mabuska you bastun goodday sarahN me and finally highking you were the only editor who did not provide support for idea N in april so based on those facts your edit summary today lead amended per option N consensus of N out of N editors is again misleading and combined with your explanation here suggests that you claim sarah is the outlier adding your approval today seven out of seven now do not object to idea N you are the seventh at any rate my reason for appearing here on your page was to clarify that your edits yesterday did not have consensus and to ask you to stop your incorrect characterization of that i think really what exists is just a loose lack of opposition to idea N rather than a consensus and that no monolithic lead sentence needs to be written for all of these counties as idea N stands it can be improved upon purely as an element of prose so i would oppose any effort by other editors to maintain that how it is written is some sort of ironclad wording that must be used for all ireland county articles 
 apologies if my maths let me down given the moribund state of wikiproject ireland it seems to be the case that only direct action spurs people to respond repeated requests for input fall on deaf ears only when an edit takes place that offends somebodys sensibilities is somebody moved to respond so sometimes a stalking horse is a necessary evil an option that can achieve a consensus of N out of N is a result by the standards of w ireland even if its only the least objectionable option thats probably as good as it gets i say go with it and deploy throughout the N counties 
 whilst we agreed on a measure im afraid it falls short in full reality initially the whole lede thing was brought up by sarahN in an attempt to remove republic of ireland from the lede however to ensure that we have to exclude the thirtytwo counties bit as it calls for the imos to come into play which was made clear its either have roi unpiped in the lede for thirtytwo counties and the island to be stated or neither we cant have roi piped and mention the island in the same paragraph 
 understood i have changed the 
 you mean should be like on the roi region additions good job forgot all about them we didnt go about creating or expanding them articles for nothing lol 
 true lets make those sobs sweat for us 
 i rejigged the prose for 
 hi tony sorry to hear your splint on a finger i wish you get well soon actually when mathsci was accusing com for absurd reasons on coms talk page i considered to draw your attention because you could be a good helper to deescalate the disputebut things are getting uglier and uglier im totally disagree with coms interpretation of blp and us politic dramaz but i do not wish him to be chased by the flocks that has unfinished political disputes with com so he are driven to decide to leave wikipedia to me he is a good contributor to cuisine and culture articles my advices so far do not work at all for himso if you do not mind would you give your input to 
 casp thank you very much for helping but there comes a time when you just have to let things go its all going to be okay or it wont dont sweat it try to be more relaxed and to just have fun like i do gtbacchus needs to rest up getting around with a cane can be tiring and hes got a bum finger from oversuing the force and the young jedi keep him very busy with their antics cheers to you both be good and stay out of trouble 
 your above comment is precisely what i have suggested you to do so for the past N days and you did not care to listen toim glad you seem to regain your usual coolness and wit but im really stressed out by the whole event and i guess i need to take another wiki break after my break on N thif i do not help you any more please do not blame me or wiki system without practical plans for improvement being in a minority means you need to very carefully and civilly approach editors in majority who would feel your view insecure and hostile with sound rationales you can get your supporters instead of being unnecessarily rhetoric pushing your view over and over or affronting to them that is a wisdom from my own experience after all wikipedia is a place to provide free and neutral knowledge editors and admins are here to write articles cheers 
 i hope you dont mistake my lame humor for insensitivity or lack of caring im just a childofmidnight after all and again i apologize sincerely 
 just a heads up it wasnt me that added the link to the coheed article it was 
 yeah i know dont worry i saw it uN 
 hi i noticed you have written material on and shown an interest in civility on wikipedia i have created a poll page to gauge community feelings on how civility is managed in practice currently at 
 thanks for the heads up i will have a look at that 
 the osi maps from N also support the name mountjoy barracks 
 may i ask as to why you deleted such a large amount of text from the county meath article and inserted in its place factually incorrect material county meath remains an administrative county of ireland and is governed as such by meath county council 
 there are no administrative counties in ireland they were abolished by the local government act there are only former administrative counties please see the 
 im confused meath county council is an authority authorities are not geographic areas they are well elected boards comprising individuals used to administrate geographic areas meath county council is responsible for the governance and maintenance of county meath therefore meath co co is the the administrative authority but co meath is the administrative division in this case administrative county what am i missing and would it not be better to state that co meath is a county rather than administrative county or fomer administrative county to state it is a former county would lead the reader to believe that there are no boundaries any more present between it and neighbouring regions or counties or districts etc also there is more to meath than the governance of the county what about sport culture etc these are all things that have a geographic limit ie co meath there are still welcome to county meath signs at the borders as far as i know there are no welcome to meath county council signs can you point me to the discussion regarding this rewording kind regards 
 on the nN border a sign says welcome to fingal the first part of your analysis is correct nowadays the traditional counties are best thought of as geographic areas these areas change over time for example westmeath was once part of meath and parts of meath were ceded to drogheda in county louth to maintain the integrity of the town their sole purpose was for control who used them for tax gathering and judicial purposes over time these purposes changed other entities were created for tax gathering purposes other entities were created for judicial purposes all that remained was local government now even that has been stripped away the coco takes on that function within the geographic area roughly encompassed by the traditional county all that remains is the gaa folk memory and title deeds sad but true 
 i understand that but the article is not about the areas administration it is about everything to do with that area and that area still exists and is still geographically defined if it was purely about administration or politics i could understand the phrasing but its not the lead line now suggests that everything to follow is about the former administrative entity can you point me to the discussion regarding the changes you mentioned in the edit summary that it was changed to reflect option N what were the other options and what was the debate regarding these changes who was involved and how long was the discussion conducted for prior to the changes 
 the area has always existed and will always exist thats not the point the article is about the county to dissaociate it from its function makes no sense it had a political function from its inception to facilitate control of the natives to say that it had some independant purpose apart from its political purpose makes no sense the two always went together nowadays the final cut with local government has been made the county now exists largely in nostalgia one might as well put up signs saying welcome to the former kingdom of midhe it would have as much relevance and legal import the discussion and option N took place on wikiprojectireland 
 i never said it had an independent purpose apart from its political purpose that is very obvious there is a very large difference between independent purposes and combined association what is now plain and clear to the uninformed from the lead sentence is that meath no longer exists in any shape or form neither political geographic cultural nor sporting etc in the article all topics are mentioned and described in the present tense but how can this be if it no longer exists in any way shape or form as insinuated by the lead sentence the infobox displays meath as if it were a current administrative division which as per the lead is now wrong also with the new format and the newly created county council pages we are now stating in wp that ireland has no administrative divisions at all simply local administrative organisations called councils which happen to coincide with former geographic boundaries of the now nonexistant county i have searched wikiprojectireland and can not find where the discussion took place can you provide a link 
 take a look at the article 
 well having taken a look at that discussion i can certainly see how that decision was made although i fundamentally disagree with it and the fact there was barely a vote on the issue and the entire argument seemed to stray off topic far more often than it stayed on topic if these county articles are referring to the former administrative areas then the info needs to be changed the co co crests can no longer be permitted and so must be removed as they now no longer refer to the same administrative unit secondly the websites need to be removed as they refer as you say to the co co area and not the former administrative county also each of the county towns need to be changed as those towns are no longer county towns of co meath co longford etc as the counties dont exist while those of the republic have only had a status change 
 i have pretty much come around to your view that labels like vandalism and trolling are nearly useless and largely inflammatory at least when applied to established editors several ani cases currently support that view now when a redlink or an ip comes out of nowhere and starts taking a machete to an article with no explanation or tries to pick a fight somewhere those labels fit but even then the name calling is unproductive dont get mad get even turn them in to 
 yeah there is the occasional but those are certainly the exception im a fan of the phrase apparent vandalism when blocking blatantly counterproductive users although my logs indicate that i slip up in practice id be happy enough if the list of common block reasons used that phrase instead of simply calling it vandalism in the automated block summary maybe i will post a note to some appropriate page about that later 
 thats a funny one if the editor calls himself a vandal who are we to argue 
 unproductive editing is a good umbrella term for that kind of thing 
 i think i am totally spamming with messages to both you and sceptre right now you mentioned self published sources and youtube self published sources and youtube can be ok but both present all sorts of problems that make using youtube not appropriate most of the time if you have the chance would you mind taking a look at 
 yeah i will have a look tomorrow morning need sleep 
 take your time and have gave a good night 
 the wording looks fine to me it seems in line with sps and even links to it 
 hi there i have noticed that you have done a lot of work with singular or plural reverts (including 
 i have responded there and completed the page move cheers 
 thanks for the quick work im presently going out for canada day celebrations but i will work on fixing all the redirects when i can 
 because of your ridiculously impressive contributions to 
 apologies for the late response i have been moving into a new room and the computers been in a box for almost N days i will cast an eye over the article as soon as possible and post a review on your talk page 
 do you have a source for the fact that 
 do you have a source that shes not trouble is unless theres evidence to the contrary i err on the side of caution and say that someones living classing a living person as dead wouldnt be very good bear in mind that is basically compulsory for all wpbiography articles but if you dont think shes alive feel free to change the parameter i wont mind 
 wikiproject report would like to focus on wikiproject spaceflight for an upcoming edition of the signpost this is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to your efforts and attract new members to the project would you be willing to participate in an interview if so you can find the 
 hi thanks for participating can you please help me clarify one of your answers on the 
 sorry not sure if you saw my note i need you to clarify what you mean by i probably should point out a good N or so of those are fortunately non articlespace useful content in supporting editing its not very clear to me what you are trying to say you can make the clarification directly on the interview page thanks uN 
 oops no i didnt see it 
 thanks for working on the article im very sorry but im still not clear about these N nonarticle space what are these are they templates project pages etc how did you get the number of N are these pages listed somewhere sorry for being a pain but i need to clarify it for our readers or they will start making comments on the article once it is published thanks again for your help uN 
 thanks for the clarification i have added some examples to show what you mean cheers uN 
 dear N forthemoney thanks for your work on 
 you are welcome although i think i should have put his name as ben loncle soul and not soul ben loncle feel free to make that change 
 you are too nice to disruptive editors and bullies i know you are tolerable of even bullies that attacked and harassed you however when a justice is needed then it should be enacted to prevent disruptive editors from doing the same behavior if aknole or com did the same behavior like 
 when it comes to math its very difficult to fake expertise i would trust interactions more than a resume if i want to know whether someone is truly a competent mathematician i think the community is beginning to open its eyes to what you say that being an expert does not excuse incivility extreme or otherwise we just have to be careful not to swing too far in the other direction as a reaction thanks for your comments 
 obviously perpetrators and bullies win and survive because wikipedia allows them to do so 
 we are working on that it takes a cultural change and those are difficult suggestions are always welcome 
 one suggestion would be for cb to learn the difference between debate and de bait 
 thy is a subject pronoun thee or thou would be the object pronoun 
 are you sure its a republished press release from dep it does read like a press release but mpogd may have factchecked dr cats first mmo to be online for N years continuously claim and put it forth with their own seal of approval perhaps im giving them too much credit though 
 yes see the title of and compare the text 
 thanks i have the citation accordingly tsk the lack of nondepwritten sources are a problem i wonder if i should send an email to dep asking if they know of any news articles or such about furcadia given their wellknown lack of response to emails and my hazardous relationship with them its probably a lost cause but 
 is 
 cheers for checking it out i always wondered if it was correctly deleted or not 
 per comments made 
 there is already a timestamp in the page history i refuse to add another one you are trying to make the process needlessly bureaucratic 
 we have moved your barnraisings and crosswiki collaborations panel from slot bN on sunday to slot bN on saturday to avoid a scheduling conflict thanks 
 btw it would also be good if you folks could make some preparations among yourselves about how best to work together on the panel i will be sending you all an email on this soon 
 hey guys take it somewhere else im trying to do stuff here and orange banners that dont concern me are annoying stop blowing kisses at each other or take it elsewhere please 
 havent you heard sarah palin has resigned as governor in order to run for president this is news on the order of michael jackson well maybe not but its close 
 please leave me alone is it somehow difficult for you to see that im not in the mood for this shit go away already 
 just wanted to say how much i enjoyed being on the panel with you at the conference and to thank you not only for your excellent talk which was a perfect leadin to clockworksouls talk and mine but also for being so considerate about cueing up our talks and so on it was great to meet you if you live in this general area as you may have seen i can get you into any museum for free so let me know if that would be helpful sometime oh and if that was your camera i would love a copy of the photo of us three best 
 i live over in detroit but if i return at some point perhaps i could take you up on that offer either way good luck with your projects both on and offwiki 
 it was great to finally meet you in person best of luck with your pursuits furry and otherwise 
 likewise and im sure they will go just fine 
 hi greenreaper just wanted to let you know that in a thrift store in california i bought myself a pair of applegreen jeans and also another hoodie a green tropical patterned one i enjoyed my green outfit so much at the conference and your appreciation of my being in green helped make me realize even more how great it really is so thanks for the inspiration say hello to your avatar for me 
 grins well i will be wearing green myself for the next five days as im flying to in a couple of hours i will be sure to let him know once i unpack him from the overhead compartment 
 you could also try asking on the 
 status of this media or image concerned is advised 
 yes it can its not a complicated concept read the image description page 
 which means that the image as a whole has to be treated as nonfree ie not be plastered in free content templates 
 in fact looking at the image the background is not important and the main focus of the image is freely licensed as such the image should be recreated without the nonfree components 
 go right ahead i spent far too much of my life getting that image onto wikipedia in the first place for me to bother 
 yeah i have just reviewed all my contributions to that thread and not once did i mention anything about your mathematical edits or about anyone elses not once id very much like to know what you mean by statements about mathematical edits 
 mathsci though is just a symptom of a generic problem that of experts editing articles in their area of expertise no print encyclopedia would allow this rather experts write articles they are then edited by editors who represent the publisher and the readership for experts may not be good communicators in addition to the possibility of experts holding and pushing personal povs that ordinary mortals might not even vaguely recognize some of these editors might be experts or close to that some might be less knowledgeable who then stand in for the readership i have come to the conclusion that we should start to treat experts with much more respect and as having a coi on the topic its the job of experts to advise the rest of us if an expert cant explain the topic to the editorial community to a few editors who put some serious effort into it how can we consider that their articles are valuable to the project i find it hard to believe that there is no way to explain the topics involved to generally educated readers in a way that at least provides something more than a wall of equations if a subject is so abstruse that its impenetrable except to a few id say that it wouldnt deserve an article but only perhaps a sentence in a more general article if that remember our content should be verifiable by an ordinary editor but it must also be more than that it must be intelligible 
 excuse me abd mathematical articles in the encyclopedia britannica are written and signed by experts in the subject the same goes for mathematical encyclopedias you really seem to have got the wrong end of the stick in your case you attempt to edit scientific wp articles way beyond your understanding and usually make withering comments about experts this raises serious issues with any namespace article you edit there is no such problem with any of my namespace edits 
 this is a strange misinterpretation of my words i do not think there is anything wrong with you being an expert and spotting those errors i dont think there is anything wrong with you working to get aknole away from that article i think the way you did it was foolish i want you to do precisely what you did minus the foolishness approach human interactions as intelligently as you approach mathematics 
 i have zero complaints with your namespace edits and nowhere in the thread have i taken issue with them at all i have said that you were uncivil to aknole and that is true my last post in this thread was clarifying to aknole that i think he does not have grounds to pursue action against you that is the point i was making which led you to think i was attacking your mathematical contributions if this is how you treat people who try to defend you from frivolous harassment then id hate to see how you treat people who actually wrong you 
 gtbacchus please and reread what charles matthews yellowmonkey david eppstein cbm and wmc have written in particular the words faux naif and pratting around the virulence with which people have written seems inversely proportional to their mathematical level of understanding aknole was pratting around because even the notion of group was beyond his understanding charles matthews said that the worst thing on the talk page was written by your friend childofmidnight who i believe called me a jerk on his talk page and made a similar personal attack on me on aknoles talk page anyway on the ani page you seem to have blown hot and cold somehow following the crowd rather than thinking for yourself your analysis of what aknole was doing which didnt take into account that almost sentence he wrote contained mathematical errors and misconceptions many of them howlers shows that your mathematics is too shakey for you to make dispassionate and informed comments charles matthews made a very good point about childomidnights posting on the talk page for which he was blocked com also called me a jerk on his talk page and i believe made a personal attack on me on aknoles page these things dont seem to concern you in the slightest shell kinney said that aknole appeared to be wikihounding me that he was following my edits this is something that you have chosen very conveniently to ignore i cant see any point in continuing this discussion in these circumstances i think you will have more fun with abd although i personally find it quite difficult making any sense of almost anything he writes good luck 
 i dont disagree that aknoles posts were very clueless i dont disagree that he was pratting around i havent disagreed with that at all and i havent defended any of his edits i dont defend com calling you a jerk i think thats uncivil and wrong i dont defend aknole following you around i havent said anything in support of that i have noticed that i sometimes come across wrong if i fail to criticize each aspect of a situation i dont necessarily feel i have to criticize aknole to you hes obviously in the wrong regarding his article edits and i thought that went without saying if i seem to criticize you more than aknole its because you are more important to the project hes gone im pretty sure and scores of editors like him will come and go experts are different you are very valuable because of your knowledge and we want to keep you thats why its so important that you pursue dispute resolution in a way that will minimize stress for you earlier in the same thread i suggested that in similar cases you appeal to wikiproject mathematics for backup before the temperature gets too high is that really such a bad suggestion 
 it is a just simple tip so you can use it or ignore it enjoy the holidays 
 thanks for that im actually pretty happy with the color i just dont like for people to have conversations on my talk page that dont concern me because i have to keep checking back to find out no theres no message for me i find that annoying 
 hmm yeah im sorry for that and promise that would never happen again but i came here to talk with you not with him so his interference that holds a scornful twist irritated me i have sent him blatant messages in metaphor that i do not want interferance but well his language and my language differ from each other anyway the orange color really had bothered me when i had ardent fans coming to my talk page so i needed a neutral color for peace of mind and assumed you would feel the same way a bit 
 oh i dont mean to cast blame anywhere we are all just humans try our best to muddle through maybe a color change would help my nerves i might try a light blue or a nice earthy brown you use green you say plants are green and we like them 
 i have been using this one for a while 
 in the best of all worlds maybe the message bar could be colored in something soft pastel from users you want to hear from and flashing international orange or red from those you dont want to hear from 
 interesting then i could just stare at the top of the page and pour bourbon drinks until it changes to a nice color and only click through then that sounds difficult to code up 
 the motto of the truly dedicated wikipedia programmer is the difficult we do right away the impossible takes a little longer 
 hey there finally got around to taking a look again what an improvement im very impressed if you nominated it for ga id likely pass it without question i left a note at the peer review but i will say it here too its fa quality for sourcing but a better prose cleanup is likely warranted to get it any further i dont know if 
 thanks cant take all the credit though seems that just yesterday 
 i saw your comments on the recent an or i report re this user and was actually in the process of adding something when the thread was archived which is fine because i really wanted to comment to you i have had a little experience with this user and yes he has a tendency toward what id call impatient incivility he seems to have improved actually and in the current edit warring flap hes been fairly restrained given that he was being accused of bad faith for starters he went to 
 best to simply fix the crossreference this is not considered editing another users comment for the purposes of 
 it should be 
 please see 
 bear in mind that most of the other images were uploaded in N at that time a detailed fairuse image rationale was not required all of the above messages were added in the space of a few minutes a couple of hours ago i cannot address them all at once yet i still placed a hangon template on this image it was apparently ignored 
 please stop posting robotic messages to peoples talk pages when they edit an article you are monitoring ~ 
 i didnt i typed that in manually no script or bot was used 
 seriously in N we are still doing the tinyparochialism where we dont want to be muds because muds are stupid killthemonster games come on that isnt helping anybody not with the way the community has evaporated we have enough problems on wikipedia without insisting on fragmenting ourselves for archaic reasons if it helps i can also produce reliable source citations spelling out that mud is a generic not anything implying combat or any other particular sort of game and in fact encompasses mu and mdash 
 then you should recategorize 
 well that seems pretty sensible and mdash 
 i have submitted an autobiography as an article in response to several requests for my resume from various sectors of society here in the philippines while done in good faith my lack of familiarity of the rules caused the nomination of the article 
 i just read your prompt and encouraging response alex thanks very much 
 thanks for that very nicely commented code it seems to need a table to be set up do you have the schema or sql for that handy 
 again you could probably cut out the section that involves it and and it would work just fine at least for users who have actually made any contributions to the wiki or you could just have it try every username and figure out some kind of cache just be careful you dont want to run into a userid clash 
 hi greenreaper can you take a look at what was posted on nick brandts page i dont understand what he means is it really that bad that the article needs to be deleted let me know what you think 
 he took another look and removed the tag 
 hi your input is needed 
 from the look of it the only change necessary from a developer perspective is the addition of the different notice for anonymous users although it might be possible to handle this in script the wikimedia it people just need to change the configuration setting determining which user groups can create pages you should probably along these lines as this is how such changes are tracked and discussed im not personally involved in wikimedias infrastructure im too busy running 
 obvously you have to be careful about extrawikipedia visibility i recall that 
 im george a jacobs called tony who lives at in denton texas i work at unt in the math department talk to me about outing 
 i know some admins who have been literally threatened so anonymity can be a good thing though they probably know the average texan has a gun and knows how to use it however the anonymity option along with anyone can edit is what leads to a fair degree of trouble here theres a wikipedia wannabe called citizendium which requires full disclosure its probably at the other end of the spectrum in several ways 
 yes bugs i probably know more than you do about our past outing cases thanks for your concern i not only have a gun and know how to use it but im also not a complete idiot online 
 i am though hence all the questions as regards your name and address i dont pay it no nevermind for all i know that could be a total ruse you could be a buddhist monk high in the himalayas watching the sun rise over qomolungma every day 
 if you think that then you must not think much of buddhism 
 that was just a random example actually it comes closer to describing my situation though not all that close just in certain ways but since anyone can edit identities shouldnt really matter unless they do something to bring shame upon wikipedia then we hunt them down and parachute them into the rottweiler farm 
 and you are telling me to consider my toneuN 
 have you seen the page just wondering 
 thanks a lot for tipping us off to something and then telling us not to look at it however i wont be looking at it 
 good please dont but since gtbacchus and i are already stained i decided to direct it to him 
 i saw after ec and repost sorry about the confusion stained not good now i did go to the specific url that you mentioned there didnt seem to be anything harmful there but it also didnt strike me as a site i want to get involved with 
 heh did you scroll down 
 i dont recall is there something there that could damage my computer 
 im glad you didnt scroll down it wont harm your computer 
 did you see the cat with the lime hat 
 i dont recall that specifically but is that the internet photo with a kitten wearing a lime rind like a little football helmet 
 yes it is what did you see 
 i think there was a picture of the user there was no lime on his head though 
 i dont think you went to the right page if you truly care enough you could email me the page you went to though i dont think its great of me to help you find it 
 i went to the one at the link you posted and no im not interested enough to pursue it further there was just something weird about it not for all tastes i guess maybe im just used to wikipedia while someone else might find wikipedia to be weird 
 ok although im not sure what it is that you saw 
 everyones got me afraid to link to that page again so i guess it will remain a mystery unless gtb feels like decorating his user page here the same way 
 oh you went to gtbacchuss userpage im talking about another one and now i feel bad because if you saw what i was talking about so nonchalantly you might then be quite appalled at me 
 then lets not go there that would place a heavy burden on me and i dont want to be appalled bearer 
 good im sorry about that standards at wikipedia have been lowered 
 yes lowered into the ground like my joke just above 
 in response to commetary at 
 have a great day sir 
 i tried almost abusive comments to the point of regarding absurd and irrational tagging of tasmanian inaccessible islands and rocks and got ignored amusing perhaps sad to see you removing em for wa( sort of 
 at the end of the day if its got a zero chance of ever getting a pic i dont see how the tags meant to be useful during my last trip to melbourne i had trouble itemising a list of places needing photos and ended up sticking to quite defined areas for lack of guidance if someones determined enough to get even N of the ones im removing they are probably able enough to either determine which of their projected destinations do not have photos or are happy to risk duplication 
 can you add some context to the culo del mundo affirmation in the article as it it now it hardly seems encyclopedic 
 no never made it past marti but i heard talk about moa is it true that sherritt sold its intrests in moa to a chinese company other places that would qualify for the description would be the red earth woods in casillo or the mosquito infested swamps in majaguillar that would be in cuba in the wide world im sure theres far worse places 
 hi beardo i think i may have cured your concerns over the redirect but im not sure have a look and see if you think i have done it 
 i understand your points concerning the allegations of tourist apartheid in cuba i had to fight to get it to tourist apartheid it actually read simply apartheid in cuba at first which was even worse i think it was set up after a dispute over israeli apartheid anything that anyone could find that was described as apartheid somewhere got a page 
 beardo N N september N 
 i have a ton of these growing on my property down south i have got some heavey equipment going to be onsite next week i will take serveral pics for you when i go do there as to the anthurium i dont remember seeing any but i will be on the look out and will ask around 
 the source is in the page 
 ah a bit of a look in 
 major rewrite now done can you find the other species in sections antirrhinum and orontium 
 if youre not overworked how about all the isolated oceanic rocks of tasmania that got tagged i tried reasoning with the ed before becoming close to i gave up at a level of incredulity that some of the locations are difficult enough for human presence once in a blue moon let alone one with a camera or intention to put it on commons oh well up to you i can think the logic of the tagging and the experience of the photo acqusition are so diff so many times sometimes photos happen before arts and arts follow later oh well you may get visited the next talk item may be dont say i didnt try to reason with the ed ( 
 i will certainly have a look although it will probably be the weekend what motivated this spurt of activity was seeing a tag on aldersyde my default minor town article i will be getting onto tasmanian things more generally later this year and during N btw 
 an image that you uploaded 
 discussion is ongoing on 
 i respect your position on citing for my contribution to crepes of wrath ideally every entry should be cited nevertheless i feel your removal was hasty and possibly even impertinent my reasoning is thus not every item in wikipedia is cited and generally items of what might be considered common knowledge are often never cited i will return my contribution with a citation but i do proffer a small objection to your removal without discussion or substantial cause regardless i appreciate your reminder that added information is best cited 
 replied at your talk page 
 i have no complaints what i had thought was a very minor affront was instead clearly aligned with good article policy however i was both unaware of such a policy and was subsequently unaware that this article qualified after reading the entry defining a good article though i am left confused how a person could determine if an article meets that criteria featured articles have the star but outside of perusing the list of good articles how can i tell if an article meets that definition i apologize for taking your time in this most of my contribs qualify as minor edits admittedly i find the policies for adding material so complex that i often feel daunted tia 
 pzrmd its just the pain series whats the big deal 
 bugs you are smart not to go back there unless you like i browse w or the equivalent of N condoms on that site will give your computer syphilis 
 bugs another thing if this person had been trying to cast me in a bad light by association with the website then you amplified the question for him and broadcast it to the community at large by posting a question at ani that was not urgent in any way thanks please do not reply to threads on my talk page that i havent had a chance to reply to if you cant resist replying to posts on this page that dont concern you then please unwatch my page this is really annoying all you had to do was wait another halfhour and i answered his question please dont busybody in my affairs thank you 
 your complaint has been noted and logged 
 i will make ya a deal though if you will affirm that i am not on your watch list then i will take you off my watch list as well 
 i only wanted to know whether it was an impostor im not trying to cast you in a bad light although it might have seemed that way there are people on wikipedia that i like that edit there 
 fair enough i hope you dont feel that i have accused you of that 
 and i wanted to know if participation in sites like that is frowned upon i think its a fair question to raise there is this idea circulating that somehow extrawikipedia activity is irrelevant its not irrelevant the internet is wide open if an editor here especially an editor with authority has a site elsewhere that criticizes wikipedia or associates himself with a site that criticizes wikipedia than that association is fair game for discussion and not necessarily in a bad way as i suggested before if someone critizes wikipedia the first question that should be asked is whether the criticism has merit i gather that a site called wikipedia review is much more notorious here than ed is even criticism from the most offensive sites like those that try to out wikipedia admins needs to be considered as even a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and then 
 bugs i agree its a fair question to raise i have an issue with the way you raised it if you have questions about my participation at any website just ask why you thought pzrmds question was a suitable topic to raise at ani mystifies me thats not what that page is for also if you want to know whether participation on offwiki sites is discouraged just ask that question theres no reason to add for example gtbacchus may or may not have an ed account lets all look thats what i find annoying with no real cause you just focus a thread on the most dramaintensive page on the site on the question of whether or not i edit encyclopedia dramatica it should be bloody obvious that im the same gtbacchus for the following reasons i have got a screenshot there from when i was logged into wp as an admin because its a funny screenshot that would be tricky to fake theres the photo of me at 
 i now agree it was not appropriate to bring to ani it was one of those things that seemed like a good idea at the time it wasnt thanks for the explanation of ed and wr i dont think i would like either site too well but i say again that criticism sites should not be dismissed totally as regards watching your page if you will affirm that you are not going to watch my page i will take your page off my watch list also and we will be done for now 
 you are not on my watchlist and i dont intend to add you to it 
 and as of the moment i hit save on this edit you are no longer on mine 
 i guess it was because most of the credits on that page were fore pete and i didnt know which ones were for oliver 
 ah yes thats quite useful i have put it in a subcategory of 
 hmm thats a good point i dont know really it was the closest i could find but you are correct that it isnt really a franchise i have placed it in 
 hello beardo check the edits history of the cuba and fidel castro discussion pages there maybe an ej imposter among us 
 by this edit you removed an anon users comment on the talk page that comment was actually an attempt to alert registered users of vandalism on the main page 
 thanks for the note beardo and sorry for the inconvenience cheers 
 i hope he will choose another ip address the ip address in question is indanger of being possibley banned 
 your suspicions were right it is ej afterall furthermore hes begun his blogs again if he continues i just might report him again 
 i understand ej is knowledgeable and a source of information however that dosent give him permission to blog the talk pages if he wants to blog let him create an account and then blog on his own talk page i have nothing personal against ej but if everyone blogged article talk pages thered be little room left for what they are actually for blogging on public talk pages are frowned upon by wikipedia 
 best wishes i am sorry this is rather long but i just wanted to add my support to your general thrust and maybe out of this verbiage you might be able to pick out something of use 
 thanks for this note simon im glad to meet you i appreciate the chance to see through your eyes a bit and im encouraged at your description of areas of wikipedia that really are relative havens from the drama of ani rfa drv arbcom etc etc im reminded of the balmy quietude of the stubsorting project where i cut my teeth as a new wikignome and the relative calm of requested moves where the worst conflicts we see are over how to spell 
 hello beardo im seeking your guys (
 how about focussing our attention and efforts on more important matters 
 arent wikipedia policies and rules important too help me guys help me to help ej 
 agreed beardo for futher discussion on this topic go to 
 see 
 so my real question is do some wiki editors hide their ignorance behind consensus and should they have to demonstrate that they have researched both side of the debate before joining one side or the other any one can play a consensus numbers game with little or no understanding of the topic being discussed 
 this is an excellent question or set of questions im going to chew on them for a while before i reply properly i can say this much now consensus is not a numbers game and most wikipedians know that claims that someone is hiding their ignorance behind consensus will tend to alienate uninvolved editors they would consider that to be against the spirit of 
 did i dream it or did i read somewhere that you wrote that cesar romero was descended from jose marti 
 indeed yes see http or or wwwhistoryofcubacom or history or funfacts or cesarromhtm it is mentioned in both the 
 some people edit articles some people specialise in afd or ani or rfa some people specialise in policy pages other people appear to specialise in arguing over page moves peruse 
 yeah i will get over it thanks for the moral support 
 i am wondering why you removed my edits and references from this article and did you then nominate it for deletion or was that someone else whats up doc einar aka 
 im sorry i accidentally removed the noninfringing content you had written because you had mixed it with the infringing content next time you should probably rewrite the article in your userspace instead and then replace the real article with that and no i did not nominate it for deletion that was 
 ps your article looks wikipediaperfect to me 
 maley and taunton will give you a great idea of how to use references though the article body does not yet contain enough meat so will 
 at the moment i cant find the time to work on my article can i keep it on its sub page as long as i want 
 i have a lot to learn 
 you learnt how to be an author you learnt how to be a journalist this is just a weird pseudoplace in cyberspace with arcane rules designed by the community that forms it and just to make life complex it doesnt always keep to its own rules see 
 im now working at trying to study the reference coding and thanks for adding the ancient zappa interview to frances lynns page looks much better 
 with respect to the 
 what about it it looks kind of long kind of interesting 
 yeah it is interesting isnt it unfortunately user 
 the big problem is the conspiracy accusation thats been the whole core of his hypothesis and despite numerous denials by people who were there in the early days of socionics he still clings to it 
 i was just out of town for a couple of days im back now online and able to take a look at the situation thanks for explaining the background 
 appears the craze sent people up the wall im still mulling the fraction coloring over in my head interesting stuff thanks for sharing i think you answered this before but do you normally compute it using the drawings or formulas i think you said kind of either way or something wishywashy i guess i could look up the response but i only have short term memory so i forget where it is 
 hmm im not sure whats normally done but my inclination would be to use the drawings to decide what i think the best number is and then use some algebra to prove that my guess is right i still have designs on that article and making the whole thing more accessible id like to know how to make better images for it 
 actually depending on the graph i might do just the opposite ie use algebra (in particular 
 cheers 
 conversely the present move was done with no discussion and is not supported by any convention a restorative move is in order if it had still been an issue it would have continued to be discussed controversiality cannot be said to have permanence 
 thanks for getting back to me i often wonder and sometimes even worry about these things i was intentionally mixing my writings with the other stuff to create something that was not a copyright violation it seems to me that the plagiarized parts of this article from findagrave i believe were actually lifted there from somewhere else but since they do not have the sort of eye towards copyrights that we do they were not concerned life is good happy new year unless you are holding out for the 
 happy new year to yourself 
 hi to assist global anticounterfeiting efforts you may wish to consider marking images of banknotes you upload as specimen in some way if those banknotes represent legal tender 
 thanks for your note the image came from the cuban central banks website so i guess they arent worried about forgeries the image quality is not really good enough to copy and anyway N pesos are worth about N cents us money so it would probably cost more to forge one than it is worth 
 ah ok if its from an offical site you might want to add your comments above to the rationale though your discretion 
 thanks for your help as well as for your cautions about inflammatory language i guess being clever doesnt make up for being snarky perhaps i should have waited to see if he would respond to another civil request and then sought administrator help myself cheers 
 its no problem if you do find yourself needing admin help in the future you are welcome to post here i cant promise i will be online but if i am i usually respond pretty quickly happy editing 
 hey sorry to bother you but i think as an administrator you need to take a look at prestonmcconkies contributions since he posted the above message to you they are certainly not appropriate and i have already warned him about them 
 thanks for the headsup 
 not a problem just fyi his attitude problem is further evident on my talk page 
 that that actually moved me 
 thanks its all that talk recently at the civility poll that got me thinking about how uncivil we can be enforcing it 
 thanks for taking my comment in the good spirits it was offered i think your appendage was helpful im not really sure what the whole highly threatening thing is about but i try to refrain from pushing everyone to fit into the same round holes and i do know that lots of editors dont like getting templated messages as they feel its uncivil and discourteous and that their substantial contribution history here warrants better treatment heck i got raked over the coals for a couple of spelling corrections on an article talk page and another time for making a copyedit that an expert on the subject area didnt like its dangerous out there best wear a helmet keep your head down and keep moving speaking of which im off for some flag football we are undefeated so far this season 
 we got crushed 
 it is unfortunate that this user left it until the last edit to actually explain why he she did what he did so in retrospect it obviously is not vandalism however i recognized the deletion was good faith right away there is no excuse for you to revert twice that line the user deleted was just recently added and was under trivia we dont need everything in every article i personally wouldnt have deleted it but you have to respect other users ideas about wikipedia 
 honest mistake my apologies 
 thanks i should have put my comment above more lightly sorry 
 i have read the above discussions with interest and i can understand how it could be titled rear admiral or rear admiral but i can not understand how the above discussion resulted in rear admiral the most quoted example is rear admiral x is a rear admiral rear admiral x is a rear admiral was never justified or even advocated yet thats what the article ended up being called can someone explain this to me please 
 gtb i have watched your work and been impressed with your abilities im sure that there will be times that i will not completely agree with you but i certainly respect your thoughts and insight i stand before you now in request for guidance would you review and offer some input please uN 
 ah yes that thread i actually noticed it a couple of days ago while wondering what wh was up to these days im going to sleep now but i will write something here in the morning meanwhile i wish you a good evening 
 i think wh has shown that he has no regard for community standards of courtesy he has declared that hes not here to work collaboratively that he doesnt agf and fuck off to anyone who questions his behavior if you set up an rfc about this editors general behavior i will endorse it (im looking at 
 and you i think i found a less contentious way of phrasing it and i expect a mixed response as well as several paragraphs of personal abuse directed my way i wont be online much today and tomorrow because im undergoing daysurgery and then resting in a house with no interwebs i hope i didnt just start a fire or if i did that its a useful one 
 i certainly agree with you im a bit strapped for time as well but i will do my best this evening to address these items to the best of my ability thank you gtb i consider myself inexperienced in many wp areas so i do appreciate the help uN 
 its no problem im glad to have you on board this crazy boat we will get there 
 in for a penny in for a pound i guess uN 
 welcome to the been spoofed club 
 thank you its nice to be considered important enough to be impersonated you know i have worked myself up from nothing to a state of extreme poverty 
 you are welcome for the notice 
 that comment is a groucho marx quote a mathematicallyinclude user pointed out that from N to any other level be it extreme poverty or extreme wealth is an infinite percentage increase especially if its all in virtual dollars 
 why did you remove my ratings table from the simpsons article it was referenced and most articles on shows use seasonal ratings now 
 you do not have consensus to add that table to the article see 
 wasted a lot of time for nothing then lol 
 uN hey there gtb im back i just wanted to say thank you again for your guidance and help here a couple things regarding hmmm maybe not the most eloquent edit i have ever seen you make but perhaps one of the more effective ones lol anyway i was hoping to get a higher volume of feedback from other admins but perhaps the giano block stole some of the attention away from it all no matter it gave me enough through the an thread and the rfc to feel more secure should i feel compelled to act in the future i did feel that some of this recent incident was tainted a bit by some excessive provocation but for the most part it was informative to me i think its a bit sad that more admins who agree have been hounded into silence but i guess we have to play with the cards we are dealt it looks as if this has pretty much run its course so i may just go ahead and close the thread in the near future if someone else doesnt anyway thanks again its an honor and a true pleasure to work with you uN 
 hey maybe we will even work together on an article someday my adoptee for the nodrama week is 
 i have read some of your comments and contributions with interest is my conclusion that you are probably one of the most sensible sane and well humoured wikipedia editors i have come across good job 
 thank you stranger 
 last but not least take a look at the bottom of my talkpage maybe also the rfc thats mentioned there and bear in mind that this is the last opportunity that you will get 
 im having a look at the situation what does this is the last opportunity that you will get mean 
 i also want to complain to you regarding this edit http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitletalk per centN abobby_fischer and diffN and oldidN made by admin sjakalle but in it he accuses me of wpididnthearthat while he himself obviously becomes guilty of it in his edit he also makes personal attacks in his edit and brings up other issues and edits not being discussed in the rfc thereby disrupting it and finishes off by making empty inappropriate threats and i have to say that this sort of conduct from a wikipedia administrator is not something that should be tolerated at all really if you could please intervene regarding these issues then that would be very well appreciated seeing as my efforts to ask these users to strike out their inappropriate remarks have not been fruitful 
 i can see i have got some catching up to do im just off to lunch but i will be back online soon thanks for your patience 
 i want to complain to you regarding incivility and personal attacks from user loosemark i attempted to discuss the matter with him http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitleuser_talkloosmark and curidN and diffN and oldidN but he had no interest in doing so and i am therefor asking you to do something regarding this but you warned me for personal attacks regarding that article and therefor it is only normal that you dont give others a free pass for somewhat more aggravated behavior than i was guilty of if you could please take a look at this matter then that would be very well appreciated 
 this thread seems to have dropped off my radar recently i apologize for not getting back to you sooner i will mention that asking editors to strike out their inappropriate remarks is something that requires a high level of diplomacy and if you are the target of those remarks is roughly N per cent likely to worsen the situation try to put yourself in other peoples shoes what would be likely to inspire a courteous reaction your complaints here are about situations you can resolve on your own just dont adopt a combative mentality also think about where im coming from its very clear and easy to say dont call people fucking morons thats a nobrainer its obvious that using such language will never improve any situation and its so flagrant that it leads to a clear and firm warning as you received never talk that way on wikipedia and if you do expect things to go badly for you count on it now you complain that someone accuses you of wpididnthearthat while being guilty of it himself that might be true pretty much anytime anyone accuses someone of ididnthearthat its code for im right and you are not admitting it duh he says you are stubbornly wrong and you say that because hes stubbornly wrong thats a personal attack its not a personal attack its just stupid hes stupid to mention wpididnthearthat because thats a stupid essay cited by people who dont realize how useless it is and how escalatory such accusations are thats because a lot of wikipedians arent very focused on dispute aresolution they are focused on winning be the other kind of wikipedian and watch your experience here change for the better by orders of magnitude i will comment further at arbcom you have got to learn to play wikiball as if you want to contribute and not as if you want to be banned its a skill learn it the surprise is that you get there by being good and by never letting your focus shift from edits to personalities play like you want to win not like you want to go down in flames 
 please be careful about reverting edits especially reverting edits which themselves are reverts of actual vandalism theres a troll on 
 i contribute to wikipedia and do not allow vandalism on any article you may use the 
 that site is not appropriate and doesnt deserve to be there 
 i apologize but theres no need to be rude 
 the edit was clearly out of line absent ongoing problems there is little likelihood of tracking the person down many ip addresses are dynamically assigned and might not be associated with the same computer now that they were N minutes ago similarly theres not much use blocking or warning an ip address unless we know that theres actually someone there to block or warn if there is a pattern of abuse coming from a certain address or range of addresses then you can bring that up at 
 i do not know your the reason for changing moreno to marino but i presume because the name marino was used once in one of the episode however i put the source in because it officially stated moreno in all parts of the book if you change that that would make the reference i put in as incorrect therefore please change to the reference that says her name is marino i am done with reverting this so i will leave the others to decide please see the talk page 
 forgive me for blaming you too early very rude of me just checked the edit history and it was not you who changed it to marino in the first place i noted that you changed andrea marino article redirect however a help would be appreciated to decide whether to use marino or moreno apologies 
 please ignore my earlier message i found a solution the problem is that in the episodes it uses marino while in writings such as book and internet it uses moreno 
 two can play at that game i didnt really expect an itn for this so it was all the more welcome as it came as a surprise anyway you nominated it so here you go 
 thanks 
 btw thanks for considering my blp concerns about the story the blurb thats posted is fine by me and my modifications to the article seem to have stuck best wishes at least until tomorrows nobel prize 
 i recently opened an 
 i have been offline for a few days i will have a look at this and probably get back to you this evening 
 you brought up information from some critics who have legally committed slander and libel i dont think you did it intentionally but it could get you into legal problems i am giving you the benefit of the doubt that you simply read something that is currently getting someone else into legal trouble and didnt mean any actual harm 
 i dont know what you are talking about but wikipedia has a policy against making legal threats on this site doing so will earn you a hasty block if you have a legal issue get a lawyer 
 i was referring to something you said which seems to indicate that you have done some research into specific people personally concerning some slander and libel issues that resulted in threats of litigation my apologies if that was not what you were referring to it sounded like that was what you were referring to and on account of concurrent legal actions i didnt think you wanted to be involved with that although it initially appeared that you were mentioning it i am not going to say much more about it 
 which statement of mine are you referring to can you point me to it im confused but as i said please talk to your lawyer if you have legal concerns i will look out for myself thanks 
 it was some weird statement you made that was completely out of place like you knew something about the past incident 
 please either tell me explicitly what you are talking about or else stop talking about it

 thanks wayne good to see you back 
 your welcome and thanks seaphoto and i have done new page patrolling im trying to make an article for a dyk by using it in my user page before moving it to the public i glad to see you are still huggling huggleN has been made now but i say you stay with huggle 
 heyo just to let you know i mentioned the 
 oh wow i havent looked at that page since may N rd apparently i pretty much washed my hands of badagnani then after failing to mediate between him and others i see from your ani post that you have taken up the good work there for a while and i appreciate that kudos and mad props to you you know there are a lot of graduate students in the world studying wikipedia right now id like to see some science done on questions about how different personality types deal with wikipedia there might be some good practical lessons for us in such knowledge we certainly attract a different demographic of volunteers than say the

 heh i have responded 
 also see this essay uN 
 what do you recommend we do i think we can make the socionics article great if we just cut out the esoterism crap hes failed to show any sources which justify his claim despite mounting criticism worse he appears to be misinterpreting irrelevant sources as justifications for the claim i have withdrawn my support from him completely because i dont think he can be dissuaded 
 hi im just back online after some days and im processing a few things right now i see the article has been fairly stable as for the sources page i will get there as soon as i can i expect to be online for the next N hours or so with breaks for meals the issue seems to be that sections N and N of the current article are in the judgment of most editors on the article bunk is that correct if a tad oversimple

 thanks 
 hey uN aN i was wondering how can i view the source for your display title i wanted to get some ideas on how to do mine by the way i just fell on your userpage randomly its not like if i was targeting you but anyway please let me know thanks 
 thanks cuh lol btw you like my userbox heh 
 i just put forth my idea to base the rewrite of the esoteric portion of the socionics article on the information found in this link http or or wwwsocionicsibccomua or ejpsy or psy_N html otherwise it would just be infighting concerning peoples opinions of what information should go into the rewrite 
 cheers 
 how are those vandalism 
 i was offline for a while and i see that someone has blocked him its far from obvious to me that its vandalism it looks like the punchline of a joke that begins with misunderstanding misinformation and miscommunication walking into a bar together whatever 
 why dont you request adminship you are a solid contributor id speedy support it 
 hm you are the second person within the week to say that has someone been canvassing anyway you can see my response in my

 there was a or missing at the end of season N i found it by replacing the whole season N w or a copypaste of season N and when that fixed the problem i looked more carefully for differences between N and N lucky that im not usually good at these questions 
 woohoo thanks so much for the help 
 thanks for your hard work maintaining 
 i understand this lists purpose and its usefulness to monitor changes but at the same time its not a subject of any notability in itself and if someone raised an afd based on 
 it does indeed apply to other lists and the afd of some lists is how i realised the situation is somewhat interesting and potentially bad news for many such lists 
 it appears the a sensible argument is to say its used an alternative to a category with better advantages for housekeeping 
 im new to wikipedia and was wondering if you would mind too much if i used some of the design elements on your userpage as a starting point for my own im not into clutter and yours seems to manage quite a lot of information successfully im not really sure if i will even end up using it but i thought id do the polite thing and ask you instead of just copying it hope you are having a happy new year 
 you are welcome to use elements of this userpage but i didnt create it myself 
 up for deletion seems very important to me whatever it is 
 thank you i will check my sources when i get home and weigh in on that 
 done 
 thanks 
 hi i have posted a question on if you have time could you have a look at it it is about the progress of encyclopedia britannica N and the like if this is a nonexisting project can i just remove it thanks 
 i posted a reply on the talk page thanks for keeping the page up to date while im on an extended wikivacation 
 i would very much appreciate your thoughts and considerations on

 sorry about that i have changed this in a few articles following 
 i wondered if i could request your help there is a sockpuppet accusation going on on my page and wondered if you could check it out and provide a neutral party opinion thanks 
 i only just now saw this message i will pop over and see if anything is still happening 
 ps relevant http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or wikipediablogs_as_sources
 i havent said it isnt a reliable source but i have replied at the talk page there im not on some side of this question i came into the situation with the impression that sources are lacking but since im not an expert in that i have posted a question to the noticeboard theres no need to talk about it in multiple places you know i will watch the N chan talk page 
 thanks for that you made it look far too easy and i will certainly give it a try in the near future 
 sorry about that thanks for letting me know and i try not to make that mistake again 
 a request for arbitration to which you are an involved party has been opened at 
 thanks for the headsup i have moved the page 
 i have unexplained pain what do you think of this 
 nice article could use some copyediting whats bothering you about it 
 oh its at afd i think i noted there that the template was never added to the article but i must have forgotten to tell you now you know 
 thanks for the headsup i do enjoy the occasional foray into the woods of afd and my wikiadventures of late havent been taking me there im always struck by how easily people will be distracted from their goal when the opportunity presents itself to disparage an opponent that gentleman on the talk page with the sources wondering why suchandsuch was ignored when nominating the article for deletion wheres the fun in adding sources to an article when you can identify a bad guy instead right arent we a funny species 
 by we you mean 
 i have been reviewing the evidence in the N xN xN xN arbitration case N xN xN xN hasnt presented much in the way of evidence the only other person who seemed interested in presenting evidence that looked at both sides of these disputes was you would you be able to look at what i have said and it might be too late but i was hoping that more than three people would present evidence in this case 
 i replied at the second of your posted links it will have to wait a few hours but i will see what i can add 
 regarding your proposal to find a mentor for N x i do appreciate you looking for alternative remedies before bringing out drastic measures like bans but i feel that it is very unlikely to work while people around N x may have made mistakes the biggest problem has in my view been N xs stubborn persistance in forcing his point of view in not one but three different disputes and coupling that with unsubstantiated accusations and attacks the responsibility for that rests solely with N x and not anyone else N x received ample feedback from the community that the behavior is problematic including the user conduct rfc yet the subsequent behavior at the european union talkpage was more of the same lesser remedies like mentoring require some willingness to work collaboratively and accepting that parts of the behavior has been intolerable from the most recent behavior including his august N posting on his talkpage i just cannot see that happening 
 you are certainly more than welcome to fix any typo i make anywhere on the project i appreciate your leaving me a note about it here as for the arbitration case itself lets talk about that on the pages set up for it ok 
 i will just add here that i have never seen a case where socalled callling a spade a spade has led to any good result we are here for good results and nothing more nor less than that i have also never seen any situation where making a determination about another editors good faith has ever led to any good result its useless at best i do not in any way deny that 
 sjakkalle i asked gtbacchus to present evidence because i wanted to see evidence from more than just the parties to the disputes as gtbacchus said it is best to keep all the discussion in one place on the case pages if you have questions about this please ask over there where the arbitrators can see any discussion and comment if needed not sure if you have this page watchlisted so i will drop a note on your talk page thanks 
 i put 
 i removed it to clear out the 
 re nicking sources if i didnt hope that people could make use of stuff i do here what would be the point im riding on other peoples shoulders all the time this is the way that i hope we can make wikipedia the best general purpose chess information resource available (general purpose because i dont see the point in trying to compete in analysis or opening theory it violates 
 re chess results no i dont have them in fact i didnt even know about them thanks for bringing them to my attention as they look interesting we might have someone else active in the project who knows something about them it would make a good question for 
 hi again thanks for your quick response while it is certainly not the accepted analysis in irish i think it may be impossible also the best reason i can put forward is that a different set of personal pronouns are used with the irish copula 
 well its a minority view in scotland too so edit as you see fit maybe move the whole thing into the footnote and just say that this author has suggested this analysis for scots gaelic 
 okay i did that just now 
 congratulations for your qual i take it as an opportunity to drink immediately cheers 
 what is a qual i was actually just talking about your time at the

 thanks for the note i have commented in both locations 
 hi would you be so kind to look at 
 hi i was just online editing and got your message it was a ref which should have been a or ref i hope it works now 
 thanks 
 your expression that i had never heard before took me off on a tangent and also today with some friends we have been discussing the phrase sorry if i took off on a tangent 
 no worries i think jimbos talk page is a bit of a freeforall anyway 
 im happy that i said something that resonated with you and simultaneously a little puzzled you thought i was more of an inclusionist i have never really identified with either end of that spectrum taking things on a more casebycase basis am i an inclusionist after all the idea about automatic links to some sensible google searches seems good to me or at least good enough not to abort before trying it 
 suggestions of what else you would like to see scraped would be welcome i can have it done in about a week 
 thats a cool template i guess what i would like to see is something it would be difficult to scrape and thats a critical evaluation of the sources to me a count is much less important than whether the sources are independent and reliable and whether the coverage really is nontrivial i have seen it happen in deletion discussions that people say see we have hits in google books therefore the topic is clearly notable i find that to be the flipside of arguing that google counts are meaningless both arguments are flawed and neither can be repaired except through careful critical evaluation another concern is that the byline brought to you by the article rescue squadron will tend to alienate a certain segment of the community the idea that there is a squadron devoted to rescuing articles is going to come across to a lot of people as a kind of blind inclusionism i would hate to see the work you have done discounted on those grounds it seems to me that a big part of proposing new processes and mechanism at wikipedia is selling them to the community anything that makes them difficult to sell ends up working against you the two things i could see alienating a lot of users are the squadron byline and the glinks being presented as numbers these arent liabilities of the tool as a tool they are only liabilities because they might stack the deck against the community accepting the tool i dunno does that all make sense 
 actually you and mibelz deserve the thanks sometimes you seem almost like machines with the large number of good articles you create about the national championship mibelz noted that some of those championships are regional or supranational and i agree that separate categorization makes sense its a mistake to worry about categorization before there are enough articles to put in the cat but i think there are enough we also should think about individual vs team and open vs closed all of the events on 
 forgot something if we go to a regional chess championships list and or or categorization we might have to be careful potentially someone could start creating articles for us state championships although im not necessarily dead set against this if the data is adequately sourced i dont really think there are any us state championships of any interest other than local perhaps i shouldnt worry until a problem is demonstrated 
 your free time is wikipedias gain especially in 
 hello 
 well im unlikely to do anything aggressively thats not really my style i could see lots of things done aggressively that it turns out arent i agree that userfying should be reserved for articles that someone realistically believes they have a chance of improving to standards i suspect most people would be unlikely to ask to have articles userfied that they dont have definite plans to improve after all the goal is to get articles into the pedia and not into a nonindexed space where nobody will read them i would find it very bizarre if someone were to simply accumulate stub after stub in their userspace where the public will never see them that would seem strangely ocd to me of course we are just comparing our predictions about what lots of people would do and i see no a priori reason to favor your prediction or mine the standard way to find out what would happen is to try it and see what happens id be comfortable doing the legwork of deletion if such a plan were tried and led somewhere bad im not going to be irresponsible about it i would be more interested in userfying articles for article rescuers with proven records of bringing articles up to snuff perhaps a cap on the number of articles one user could keep in a userspace limbo at a time would help im certainly a lot more interested in finding things that could work than in guessing why they might not im looking for solutions not reasons to not bother trying ten years ago if someone had said lets start an online encyclopedia thats editable by members of the public it would have been very easy to say i know good intention but could see it misused aggressively very few things arent worth a try what im really interested in is avoiding the sterile debates that happen in so many afds keep clearly notable or delete clearly nonnotable once those positions are laid out the inclusionist will gain nothing but frustration by arguing at afd i want to let the inclusionists know that such arguments are a pointless waste of time and that there are altogether smarter options 
 thanks for the kind offer but i have been an admin for N months and am perfectly capable of userifying things i care strongly about cheers 
 ah you know in these discussions i dont necessarily know whos who these issues about afd culture interest me im glad theres a robust discussion going on 
 on another issue i too had a trawl around looking for the elusive fide golden book but could only find some references in a fide forum site from about a year ago where fide and ecf official stewart reuben was talking about it he promised to put the inquirer in touch with iclicki but didnt want to post his email on the forum unfortunately the discussion gave no clue as to what might be in it other than a list of title holders and dates of award of title i will send stewart an email and see if he can help 
 i will certainly tidy up the lead on the hungarian cc regarding the euro or youth champs i have no new info yet as a trial run i tried ransacking the darker corners of my cupboards and exposed a random selection of bcm or chess mags from N reading them all cover to cover took hours eventually i found N refs to the bucaramanga cadets and both confirmed dreevs win but neither mentioned any girls event i tend to think it wasnt played unfortunately the mags are badly indexed and news like that is often hidden away so its a monumental task and one i wont be completing in a hurry although i wont give up on it without a fight willy iclicki has just finished playing for monaco in the euro teams in crete and so may have a backlog of emails 
 im still a bit puzzled here to recap your numbering system works up until polgars win in N but by the time we reach N we are contradicting our reference at the bottom of the page this also appears in the lead quales contribution if i recall then the synchronization returns for the next two twic references but maybe only because we have conveniently left out N unfortunately i dont have any answers maybe twic was wrong in N unlikely i think the hungarians would have been aware of their N th anniversary for sure any ideas 
 i have responded to your comments please try and understand that putting words in quote marks does not mean they are a quote in the same way that putting words in stars does not mean they are surrounded by stars im sorry if my typographic convention offends you 
 offends do i seem upset i have had a smile on my face this whole time i also caught your response already im aware of more than two uses of quotation marks but i was a bit puzzled by yours puzzled offended im raising a glass to you now cheers and may the road rise to meet you 
 only if it is of the finest red wine 
 although to be fair even a poor red wine will often do no hard feelings i hope and off to bed for me best regards 
 yeah last nights uN acuN ac xabpoor red winexbb led to a poor morning this morning not that i wont do it again xaN i dont use some of these symbols nearly enough 
 is that you asking for undercover truthers to come here and filibuster or disrupt this website 
 read the rest of what i said i was arguing against vandalism and single purpose accounts and trying to get people genuinely involved dont ignore my previous comment which was launching vandalism attacks will have no effect and will just hinder our profitable efforts at winning the argument please there is no quick fix to this the only way forward is to spend some time on wikipedia learning the ropes and making logical rational arguements infavour of good content 
 nonetheless the call for participation by undercover truthers is disturbing 
 yes it is its hard to read that as arguing against single purpose accounts 
 not only disturbing but i believe it violates the meatpuppet section of 
 has alex jones ever been a wikipedia user if so his screed against morton or mongo and call to arms is certainly a violation and any users who answer that call would be considered meats 
 not sure 
 question does anyone have the link for the above qoute by seabhcan on prisonplanet thanks 
 its the link in seabhcans initial post under this heading 
 looks like there are few people blogging comments therethe one going by the name sane is on a pretty different page than those who normally fit the definition of that username they seem to be dupped by usernames here as well and have assumed that someone posting on wikipedia are in fact using their actual real life names as usernames here idiots 
 i see got it thanks boy thats a hard page to track 
 i posted the link in my ani comment here about seanhcan recruiting meatpuppets 
 you beat me to it with the reference amazingly fast work 
 well many thanks 
 im sure there are a lot of holes in the about that would need plugging but i wondered what you thought of the general principle 
 i like that its a creative solution i havent seen mooted before im going to think about this just now im off to get some coffee in me and attend a lecture but i will be back online soon cheers 
 glad you like the general sound of it though i think the details would need to be worked out before community presentation 
 i think community presentation is a bad idea when ideas such as this are mooted to the community everyone puts on their it will never fly wilburhats and proceed to dream up every possible disadvantage as i often say if we had said ten years ago lets make an online encyclopedia thats freely editable by members of the public we would have been absolutely drowned in reasons why that would never work in my experience its better to do what wales and sanger did dont ask anyones permission just start doing it the details are better worked out in the field than on the drawing board then when it works the unbelievers have no choice but to get on board by the way i have taken this idea started calling it an article incubator and mentioned it in the discussion back at 
 well the only think we need to do is establish a page to hold the repository (so we can store the pages at 
 yeah we will need to make a page write some text indicating what its for and then find a way to start farming actual articles from afd into it i wonder if the kids over at the article rescue squadron would be a good group to work with in setting this up i have to go study some mathematics now but i will be back online in a few hours and we will keep thinking about this if you are inspired to push forward in the meanwhile cool we will need a clever shortcut of course nothing survives without one of those a natural choice might be 
 go do your maths i will do my robotics and we will meet here again at some point to contemplate further 
 as for the deletion of crip from the infobox that was done because it is not an occupation please consider that as well 
 we are cool maybe i should have just said your vigilance for this page is a matter to consider im trying to fix the nwa category too most of my edits are to only make the material clearer and more readable im not interested in removing content some overeager people in their wish to lionize may go to far and they may not even realize it as a lack of objectivity 
 the fide site is definitely not to be trusted completely though and can really play tricks i looked up an event some time ago and it clearly gave one list of players with one winner and no games outstanding an open and shut case or so i thought what i didnt realise was that it was a N group affair and so the winner of group b despite having a lower score than the winner of group a went on to win the final between the group winners so fides record showed the runnerup as appearing to be the winner very misleading indeed im not sure why games are sometimes missing maybe lazy controllers players not handing in scoresheets illegible scoresheets the sveshnikov factor probably all four i can understand that they may not bother to show games between unrated players but this was not the case here 
 first a link that gives a very small amount of info on the establishment of the croatian chess federation you asked about bound volumes of magazines i would first of all say that these are good value i have a few myself and they are both entertaining and illuminating for people with an interest in chess history you will find lots of material for new articles without a doubt doing my research for the euro or world junior events i was amazed how many mental notes i made to go back and explore future articles if i ever get the time for those reasons alone i would encourage you to buy them if i had my time again i would buy far less books on the ruy lopez steinitz defence deferred and far more of these but to answer your specific question will it nail down those particular questions id say you have a areasonable chance with 
 hi have you got any information about robert henry barnes i have found name rh barnes in edo historical chess ratings do you know whether he was german or british regards 
 thanks would you be so kind to add a reference for his nzlch 
 hello again unfortunately whyld has a few disagreements with the nz website list of champs but nothing too major thankfully many of the winners were decided by playoff and whyld gives additional playoffs in N or N N or N and N or N additionally he gives the venue of the N or N edition as the more precise 
 im puzzled wikipedia has 
 phew sorted it fortunately as well as being a descendent of the dunlops from ayrshire a reverand and a multiple champion chess player he was also a noted ornithologist in his later years at least i think its the same guy john boyddunlop he probably married a miss boyd from nz i guess if you want to check it out you will need to use the find function on the adobe toolbar 
 on second thoughts our guy would have been dead in the N s i have changed to john dunlop as this is how the chess cafe article refers to him and it appears very expertly written 
 im in favor of this proposal the chief problem with deletion is that it is effectively saying we dont want an article on this subject ever however mistakes get made despite all of the good faith and honest work in the world notable subjects get removed for one reason or another and unless the subject finds a determined advocate the subject will remain uncovered in wikipedia however as pointed above there is the problem of articles which are moved to incubator and forgotten what do we do in those cases wait a certain amount of time before it is deleted or simply rely on the hope that eventually it will be found by the right person who will make it into a useful article 
 the latter would probably never gain acceptance as a methodology so i think there needs to be a cutoff time that can however be a relatively long time so you could have a number of weeks for improvement or an inactivity level that defines the point for removal the question is then do you move it back to articlespace or delete it and more importantly how do you decide 
 spun out of the above so that it is easy to find shall we take this to a new page at say 
 i agree 
 in the spirit of 
 excellent if anyone mfds it before i get back this evening im gonna ignore all rules all over em 
 i found a lancel in gaige but it probably isnt the right one see 
 i have found only tooraj ebrahimi who played for iran in the N th chess olympiad at siegen N i am not sure he is the same person as y ebrahimi winner at brussels N 
 thanks for the note 
 how do they know if they are up for eviction until they have all voted 
 oh in the united states we play differently than in the uk all the nominating is done by one person the head of household the voting that is actually done by all of the houseguests is for eviction the reason being is that after season N the us had their public voting rights revoked due to the fact that we made awful decisions for evictions 
 oh ok sorry bout that so do the us public not get a say at all i guess the company that makes bbus must lose a load of money from that then huh 
 yeah i miss the days where i could vote but we just voted off anyone that was remotely entertaining firespike N N august N 
 sounds like bbuk we always get rid of the fun people ( 
 you dont think nikki will be voted back firespike N N august N 
 yeh but we evicted her in the first place its only after someones gone that you realise how good a housemate they are 
 awaiting bens final assessment 
 aw gee i have hardly had time to think about it if you love life dont look at 
 i am going to hold off on this for now thanks for your comments and work 
 hi sorry to bother you with maybe a trivial question i am absolutely not familiar with the notability guidelines here before i write an article for deletion i would like to know if for instance ralf appel can pass here german im with N gm norms was german fast chess champion N german uN champion N plays in the german first division elo N 
 thank you for your kind an informative answer i was bold enough to write 
 when are we going to see wikipages for 
 that would be nice actually but 
 can you comment on the name of this topic is there a reason for it starting list of 
 thanks could you copy or move your reply to 
 can you update uservoorbot or most wanted redlinks again please 
 happy to hear the bot is working fine and the link on 
 you are being informed as an editor previously involved in discussion of these issues relevant to that policy page you are invited to comment at 
 thank you for filing this and for letting me know 
 re 
 did i make it red oh lord i started with 
 while you are here do you think its time for us to start accepting articles into the incubator 
 ah why not where are you thinking of pulling them from first 
 i am not completely familiar with the fa criteria especially for pictures criterion N does not talk about references for images however perhaps criterion N c does could you clarify what you need to know about these images also i do not understand this sentence since they are not always associated with this article all necessary sourcing information needs to be on the image description page should not all necessary sourcing information be on the images description page aregardless of whether they are always associated with the article 
 your second point is absolutely correct however i often have to convince people to add sources to images by pointing out that the images they create and host on commons have the potential to be used across N wikipedias this is generally a more persuasive way of putting that argument i should have known not to attempt to use rhetoric with a mathematician i hope that these answers help you im sorry i cannot better assess the images but i know when i am out of my depth 
 thank you your answer is very helpful 
 i have responded on your commons page and i see you and jappalang are dealing with this thanks again 
 cheers 
 eh no worries i was pretty sure id seen your name around but i tend not to follow many arbcom cases im glad you are here and presumably street legal 
 i like the street legal ya hence the knockoff of the sock notice that was on my user page for N months it was the ac that said to stick to this account which is not my original so im on the sock account and my original is blocked i believe im the only fullon sock account with ac leave to edit i dont pay the ac page too much mind these days i will offer statements once in a while and have been known to do a few clerkish things there and two of my mentors are arbs so theres regular contact terima kasih cheers 
 not sure if this speeds things along exactly but its helpful just to know what that book says although he seems to have completely missed the under N question he also reminds me that the world girls started in N with menchik something i have not mentioned up till now but was aware of im sure i have some info on this somewhere pages N N of the golden book cover the wycc apparently 
 unfortunately i dont know if its stewart or the layout of the golden book that is confused here but some events do appear to have been jumbled up maybe fide stopped printing the book deliberately with so many errors whyld gives the world junior womens championship all joined up in one table hence it is laid out thus from N as you have already noted then N senta brustman followed by N mexico khasanova N dobrna arakhamia as the book was published in N he stops there an entry in sunnucks suggests that each girl in those early editions had only one win and remained the champion until it was next contested i too read somewhere that those early editions were british wins due to the restricted or parochial nature of the competition being mostly dominated by competitors from the home countries it may be worth showing these in a small table above the main one or just join it through like whyld alternatively like you say there is no rush in fact i think a short break from junior chess might be in order 
 i am new to wikipedia any tips on learning how to wikify or make articles better 
 i could go on and on but i dont want to overwhelm you the main thing is to know that you are very welcome here and that you can learn a lot by just trying stuff you are certainly welcome to ask me about any specific question you have happy editing 
 hello i have found an information that 
 thank you very much for your answer 
 you should read the last paragraph of 
 huh well i will strike that part i would still contend that many perceive it as a racist allusion which is just about as damaging as if it really were one 
 i dont care what you acknowledge i didnt attack your mental health every healthy human on earth engages in neurotic needs occasionally im a bipolar and a drunk deal with it if you think you can have me desysopped for stopping a rampage of personal attacks cool 
 now this is more my type of discussion 
 i know right im usually so bored no wonder i drink 
 i also like a drink however i might just interject here and say that N we dont do personal missions to have you desysopped and N we dont do personal traits or behaviour im a drunk that alone justify onwiki actions just saying chaps that on balance we could let this rest 
 um sure im not drunk right now i dont edit loaded and i think whatsisname is not watching thats what he said and im sure as hell not going to call him a liar nor have i tried to justif what are you talking about i can selfdeprecate all i want im a terrible editor why do people listen to me 
 already the discussion is deteriorating it was good while it lasted 
 maybe if i launch into a N paragraph screed 
 i found something on ani about admin cabalism but its mostly heresay so far plus i find it difficult to get worked up over admins coordinating offwiki and then freaking out when their activities are exposed to the light of day just another day in the neighborhood 
 admin cannibalism heresy on ani this is something i should have known about im still baffled at the idea that im a drunk was supposed to justify anything 
 hello thank you for your nice words i take gms birthdates and years of gms title awarding mainly from fide international lists earlier titles i try to find on internet and litmanowicz or giuN cycki szachy od a do z encyclopaedia and old szachy magazines but there are still many holes unfortunately i didnt find one full source for that data regards 
 yes of course these are dbase files do you want me to send it to you via email if yes please give me your email address and tell ma which years you need regards 
 hello i tried some searching but had little luck kazakhstan azerbaijan and montenegro are not the countries covered best on the internet however it looks like aidyn guseinov died on 
 hey thanks for the barnstar these articles in fact are bare statistics and need to be filled with more information hopefully someone will improve them (
 hello excellent work on these btw any more in the pipeline i did notice that the chigorin mem N image featured lasker facing rubinstein probably not worth adding to the caption as its quite a small photo but i was curious whether they took it afterwards deliberately putting N st and N nd finishers in the prime places or whether it was taken at the start and their positions were just a happy coincidence its amazing what useless thoughts go through my mind sometimes on the rubinstein memorial page there is a minor discrepancy with an article in chess magazine which gives the N edition as shared between filipowicz and parma each with N xbd ahead of hort on N of course this could just stem from a tiebreak that the chess editor was unaware of otherwise my results N through N appear a good match 
 thanks for the info on the pdf section guide project it sounds good even if im not sure i fully understand it this would improve on the current situation with very poor accessibility to articles via our front chess page right so you use the pdf to navigate via chapters indexes and the like and eventually end up at the article you are searching for that sounds excellent if i have got it right because at the moment the external nonuser almost needs to know the full name of the article to stand a chance please correct me if im talking rubbish here also i wondered if you had missed my point above concerning the N rubinstein it was a shared win with parma i believe hopefully this link confirms it regards 
 hiuN regarding a N chigorin mem i have a lot of N s tournament sources and have checked them all quite thoroughly but to no avail it seems likely there was only an underN tournament in sochi that year it is curious though because there are lots of N sochi commemorative postal covers on ebay to mark N years since his birth so why would they not hold the memorial tournament on such a special year unfathomable the series numbers too are very confusing one source gives the N edition as the N th whereas another source gives the N edition as the N th i dont think there was a N or N tournament the chesscafe link appears to refer to a problem composition event this would make sense where it is spread over two years i would imagine these endgame study competitions to be lengthy affairs i dont think anyone has gaiges crosstables it always causes a complete silence on the talk pages that question i must remember to throw it into the middle of a fierce edit war sometime to see what happens i nearly bought all of the gelo crosstables books recently but wasnt sure if i would use them enough to justify the expense there were greatly reduced second hand copies on amazoncouk the only other possibility is to check mibelz usual online crosstable sources from a selection of his articles they are listed on his userpage he always seems able to locate obscure old tournament crosstables 
 good resultuN the chigorin article is looking much better now the midseventies are quite well covered in my collection due to having several copies of the chess player so do feel free to ask me about this period in particular good luck with the keres m when you get around to the staunton m the history is all indexed from one page so that should be relatively easy regards 
 can you say something to this user 
 well if it continues to be this way then i would suggest taking it to an or i 
 hi as usual more complications this time im slightly confused by the paderborn article in the 
 thanks for clearing that up the university of paderborn must have a very keen interest in computer chess well done with all those memorials too they just keep rolling off the production line uN 
 it appears to be related to 
 extraordinary articlebuilding expertise unamusing if you want to drop off notes about articles you think i can help with in my minimal gnomish way leave out the jabs eh if you are trying to say something else its coming across as weird veiled sarcasm 
 comedy is a tough business 
 well remember that you are online if you are going to mix in comedy about peoples writing skills with otherwise sincere posts you are going to confuse and offend people if you dont think much of my writing or lack thereof then either stick to that or dont mention it pretend praise just isnt funny memorize that and you will piss off fewer people 
 considering i barely know what the articles about i think i made some pretty reasonable changes to make it more accessible its not close to fa status yet 
 hey i just saw on some sort of arb noticeboard that you are willing to mentor durova was eager to be relieved of mentorship duties and she was involved with some interesting and challenging mentees you might check with her if she still has some that could be passed on most of the issues that im aware of have simmered down for now anyway but i think shed be happy to pass the baton on for whatever is left simmering 
 no you think im bad at stuff you disagree with my approach remember i discuss way too much to be of any use as a mentor apparently i think everyone should stop writing and discuss if you cant shoot straight with me go away if this is your way of saying something else just say it tone comes across badly online go write an article theres an 
 i must have misunderstood your statement of interest in mentoring whether wearing mentees down with discussion would be a good thing or not i am incapable of determining some of them like to talk so it might be a perfect fit as far as article work i dont think i have ever criticized you on that front my attempt at humor was just a lighthearted way of noting my support for you doing more of it i thought the article looked interesting and math related but it wasnt but i still thought somehow it might be intriguing to you the emphasis on expertise was because you had said if i remember correctly that you arent any good at article writing which i thought was silly oh well im headed back to my corner of the wiki its a good thing i removed my joke about peter and his fbombs that was probably misunderstood as well i will try to only laugh at myself in future 
 first of all it is math related secondly its not like we are on buddybuddy terms i genuinely cannot tell whether you have any respect for me or not you have made it pretty clear that you disagree with a lot of what i say and do and you have never made it apparent that you think anything good about me without veiling it in comedy what makes you think i like you enough to put up with that kind of shit your attempt at humor managed to hurt my feelings first thing in the morning congratulations my day was worse because you laughed at me why do i say you laughed at me im getting that from i will only laugh at myself in the future that indicates that you were laughing at someone else whom get it laugh with not at since you and i clearly dont share a sense of humor dont try you are bad at it you still dickishly think im all about discussion im not you are wrong or lying and i dont like you at all i respect your dedication to the project but i think you are socially clueless your attempts to be friendly come off as offensive i want you to stop posting to my talk page okay you seem to still think that when i said you dont have to discuss so much i meant you should discuss more thats incomprehensibly clueless to me you think i want you to be like me ugh please lay off the discussion you are bad at it and you do too much of it while bizarrely claiming that youd rather not take a look at yourself man start walking the walk you talk 
 hello thanks for your work to convert results to tables would you be so kind to add an image into 
 thank you 
 hi thereuN i have checked my tilburg tournament books of the N s and N s but there was nothing there that id call noteworthy just lots of annotated games and a few scraps of information that are already available in your online source i will check chess magazine for the N and N versions and get back to you uN 
 okay the format for each of these ko style tourneys comprised N days per round game N on day N game N on day N day N was a rest day but for those tied N it was the day to play N more tiebreak games and in a few cases another N also not sure what they did if they reached N presumably they played one more {armageddon game i have found the ko results for N and N and presume you only want the data from round N onwards i will email this for N soon and when i get a chance N will followuN 
 unfortunately chess magazine only did a summary of events in N and so did not publish the complete game results fortunately i managed to find them here at brasilbase i will add some text for it soon along with the relevant chess mag references if you would like to update the game results in the meantime regardsuN 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or i award you this long overdue barnstar for your tireless work on maintaining the 
 i note you dont have the alekhine memorial on your to do list have you perhaps already looked into it and found it too difficult i must admit i am speaking from total ignorance here but it sounds like it should be an important one 
 my chess magazine library continues to spread slowly and i aim to plug the gaps whenever the missing copies or volumes come available on ebay i dont have too many gaps between N and the present day and i intend to push into the N s next generally they arent that easy to get hold of though so you should probably go ahead and do your own thing as the opportunity arises and to suit your own interests and budget its obviously a lot cheaper buying unbound sets if you dont mind the inconvenience factor but personally i cant live with the mess 
 instead of putting the article up for deletion i suggest we redirect it to 
 ok maybe lets be careful in afds in the future not to suggest or support userfying articles unless they really seem to have a chance voting delete is probably the best most merciful thing to do in those cases deletion isnt mean as for this one lets give it some time the deadlines im thinking of are in the N month range print sources exist maybe not for this but maybe have you tried a bricksandbooks library a rush to decide that it will never graduate is no better than a rush to delete it in the first place or a rush to save it without careful consideration in N months someone could come up with a nononline technical journal either way lets decide in about N months for now if theres already a mainspace redirect from 
 okay i stopped a few days ago thanks for your suggestions 
 i have updated the article accordingly perhaps the stencil should be updated too the fide template came in handy recently as fide reorganised their website we only had to update our template instead of updating N s of articles welcome to the wikiproject chess and happy editing 
 wow thanks for the tip i didnt even know these templates exsisted see you around 
 hi thanks for your great work on chess related articles i think there might be a concern with the photos you are uploading currently you are tagging them as released under gnu free documentation license however on the websites they come from i cannot read that they are released as such wikipedia is normally very strict on those things if you have questions about it i am perhaps not the best person to talk to but it would be a good topic to raise at 
 thanks a lot for the warning and you are probably right too i will start a new topic in the 
 okay i got your new message and i also posted a topic on the wpchess talk page thanks again for your help 
 hey cliff i do not like to use the exact same wording as a source due to concerns of plagiarism that said that source dose specifically mention beer i have added another review article that specifically looks at the epidemiology of gout and discusses the finer distinctions of alcohols and there effects cheers 
 when researching diet issues during my first bout a few years ago i found a site i think it was a hospital saying that up to two beers a day should be safe but it was in australia best 
 if you are an editor of the paper you have a 
 will be thousands of miles from here the taxi has arrived ciao 
 oh talk about bad timing i had come here to respond to what you posted 
 made it about to sleep 
 i am currently in conversation with usergabodon an italian with a large chess library he has done some recent editing on the world junior article so i have asked him to look at the gaps in wycc he is mostly active on italian wiki and says he wrote the turin N olympiad website wow 
 alas i dont have an account on icc but looking a bit further it appears from his webpage that he is contactable at matthias@wahlsde i will give him a try also gabodon has emailed the colombian federation so maybe one or other approach will be successful regards 
 hi unfortunately that email for matthias was no longer in use so i was unable to contact himuN 
 thanks you have a good xmas too i think the beauty pageant explanation is the most likely but sadly we will never know as well as posting a few photos i also hope to do some article writing over the holiday period best wishes 
 gm wahls unfortunately is not active in chess anymore he is cofounder of http or or pokerstrategycom or though although he is not that involved into that site anymore as he used to you might be able to reach him there he used to play simuls on the fritz server but is not any more wahls is still member of the chess club hamburger sk you might write an email to this club which might be relayed regards 
 im having harassment and wikistalking problems with an editor and if you are able i would really appreciate any assistance you can offer i have made a full report on an or i 
 hi tothwolf as im posting below i have just beamed off the planet as far as regular wikipedia participation goes i hope another admin was able to help you 
 is what is happening here what i think is happening here 
 ip from a city of winnipeg network make what you will of that 
 hi im pretty surprised to find that you created for example the article 
 the same seems to be true with 
 well you were correct in that i didnt notice the talk thread before my move however the article body already uses lxeN kxfN many times so a unified usage between title and text seemed desirable 
 no need to reiterate i already conceded your point 
 hi were you aware that i had previously closed the rm discussions related to 
 i wasnt aware thanks for pointing that out or 
 looking into the situation i would have liked to see some indication of the previous closure and reversion thereof that said i see no reason to revert the move now if the editor in question is showing some interest in otherwise inactive projects and can maybe get some activity going in them i say let him move em around 
 am i missing something 
 so you are saying that an article titled the good the bad and the ugly doesnt contain any criticism since you are accusing me of not having read the article then i will assume you have including the numerous parts where he compares os x features to the corresponding ones in os N also the two links that point to an article called top N reasons why the dock still sucks seems like exactly what we are saying in the article he is comparing the usability of os x to the usability of os N and claims that it is a step backwards 
 hi there i have a possible side project that you may or may not wish to contribute to i will send you an email as i will need to attach a file regards 
 no worries the project may take a while longer but i find mindless keyboard crunching very therapeutic at times very sad to hear you cant be so actively involved but obviously im heartened by your intention to keep in touch and whilst it may not be the most thrilling task that you have set yourself its vital nonetheless and speaks volumes for your selfless attitude here on wiki best wishes 
 actually no i cant necessarily see the message at the top of the page on the phone because the screen isnt fully visible and must be navigated with my finger touch to maniuplate and move it around the last time i was trying to view the comments you made to chronie was the second and last unintentional rollback it was only at that time that i saw action completed and realized what happened when i got home and saw the messages etc thats when i knew for sure what happened sorry for the confusion i would never ever intentionally abuse any rights i have been given in wikipedia 
 thanks for replying i can see how using a very small screen would make things awkward im such a luddite my telephone is only good as a calculator stopwatch calendar address book alarm clock and what is it oh making telephone calls i cant browse the net with it so i probably fail to appreciate those limitations 
 im glad you are back taking a look at 
 i know in the past there was some issue with the sketchy history of this article being an fa oppose i think it would likely pass on this issue now todays featured article 
 and now unbelievably livie actually continues commenting about me in vidors page in response to livies message about the socalled conspiracy left on vidors talk page vidor answered thusly and livie almost immediately replied as i predicted shes not going to stop its just going to go on and on and on no matter how many suggestions or warnings she gets 
 thanks for the note i just got back from dinner and i will have a look 
 my perception of leaving me alone extends to not wikistalking my edits and looking for reasons to tattle this entire thing took place about N hours before this posting i notified crohnie and vidor about the wpwqa because in response to a posting by 
 i hope you realize most of this is meaningless to me i dont buy N or N of the complaints i get about other editors i look into it you neednt worry that i will get the wrong idea because im not an idiot i can read time stamps for example skagitriverqueen it appears that the posts you are talking about occurred before our agreements on wqa earlier lets let bygones be bygones now pursuing this further is disruptive focus on edits stop talking about each other both of you blocks will follow soon the first one to drop it wins win now so far you are both losing because you are continuing to talk about the other skagitriverqueen you are not injured by these posts of wildharlivie wildhartlivie you are not injured by these posts of skagitriverqueen what is so hard about dropping it race each other to be first drop it for good and leave it dropped get good at ignoring crap do it now neither of you will be happy if this escalates so get good at turning the other cheek start now 
 i get that you are tired of this garbage however what i dont get is why i am now being chastised for doing what you told me to do regardless of what happened when oh never mind just color me completely confused while simultaneously drop it 
 its just that the water you are talking about was already under the bridge i have made that kind of mistake too it happens lets get past it now you are not in trouble and you are not being blamed for anything just lets move on wildhartlivie seems to be willing to let it go so lets meet him halfway on that and let it go okay shouldnt we be talking about ted bundy by now 
 why isnt he dead 
 hi there the place to report persistent vandalism is 
 oddly i tried to use 
 my bad i saw a first N th level warnings while i was reverting that last change 
 umm 
 that you do my angry friend but save it for your myspace page 
 oddly i wouldnt have reverted were it not for the part about baboon defecating on the streets of ny 
 hello gtbacchus happy new year if you are not sleeping or taking a break could you delete my five sandbox pages and one page tagged for csd N thanks 
 happy new year to you too i have deleted those pages let me know if i missed anything 
 thanks you did the job nicely 
 hello i was wondering if there there is an official way to report userpages that are created to dodge a notability tag in the main article space i have been flipping through the untagged images and i have noticed a lot like that any thoughts 
 generally speaking it is possible to have a bio for an individual on your user page that would no meet the notability guidelines for an article but if the page is being used as a blog or to host web content then it may be liable for deletion in this case it looks like it is being used to host content about a group and so may violate 
 sorry i didnt know about uploading images im sorry im a new user 
 that image is attached to a fad that has circled ytmnd and N chan if you didnt intend to use it spreading the meme i apologize for jumping the gun 
 the warnings came from admin and i asked him not to visit to my talk page i can not get away from badagnani since his and my interests are too much overlapped while i have effectively avoided ronz by not editing some overlapped articles ever since the incident whether i like or not i have to make a way to work with badagnani but i dont feel the need or leeway for ronzs aggressive behavior i have suggested him lets avoid each other so i want to continue the method for us 
 huh i guess i misunderstood about the warning i will go back and see if i should refactor that comment i agree that you and ronz avoiding each other is a fine idea i would suggest that you will get there faster if you refrain from repeating accusations against him because those tend to prolong rather than end our interactions with those we wish to avoid pretend he doesnt exist perhaps when someone talks about me and my aggressive behavior im almost certain to reply in my own defense and im unlikely to go away until i know they have stopped talking about me 
 as far as i can tell these two statements are incompatible am i missing something 
 you had over a week to respond to this so i will take your silence as an indication that you dont give a crap any more if you really think my changes to this article are wrong i would appreciate a proper explanation first not just a flimsy nonsequitur in an edit summary ok thanks 
 i take it you are referring to my addition of a redirect from 
 its a fairly rare latin form of the phrase i pulled back my csd once i realized the connection 
 used all the time here in oxford but then again this town is filled with strange characters 
 obviously i need to practice my shun piking 
 im sorry but i feel like a wholesale campaign to go about removing the country of birth or in some cases the country of death from the infobox is unproductive and borders on overt vandalism i left edit summaries regarding that on the pages where other edits had occurred there is no content dispute of which i am aware i have seen such sorts of edits rollbacked in other cases 
 replied at your talk page 
 thanks i understand 
 since the scan of the comic isnt being used to illustrate the wolverine in any sense it seems that they wouldnt be in the scope of nonfree use 
 this barnstar is awarded to gtbacchus for his efforts in helping resolve disputes always keeping a cool head and making wikipedia a better community you probably dont get thanked enough for your valiant efforts thank you 
 thanks ikip im all too aware of my bungled attempts at diplomacy so im glad i come across right some percentage of the time i guess i i dunno love this project or something pain in the neck isnt it caring about stuff 
 i second this award thank you for your valuable input at 
 fair enough 
 your from boston so you definitely must have irish roots like us 
 well i can trace N of N greatgreat grandparents back to ireland and the last one is more of a question mark i have got a few from every single significant irish immigration wave to the us including the 
 please see in which 
 im about to sleep and tomorrow im taking a phd qualifying exam for N hours after that i might have a chance to log on and look at this situation or i might not after the next two days i will be made of free time if you havent been canvassing then overt accusations of canvassing are pretty harmless they are not going to get in the way of your editing so id ignore them if you can if you must respond just respond in context note that you havent been canvassing and try not to hit back with any kind of accusation at all the idea is not to be right not to have the last word not to let the truth be said the idea is to end the dispute and the first one to stop entirely wins try winning if shes out of line eventually there will be people enough to file an rfc etc otherwise we all just move on if you knew the insults i have refrained from replying to on this website the winner is the one who ignores rises above and edits the encyclopedia i speak from experience 
 my best wishes for your success in the exam congratulations on persevering through to this point 
 good luck on your exams i hope you do well i filed a 
 i was just coming here to ask you to look at i can ignore a lot of things here at wikipedia but i can not ignore someone looking for someone outside the project to find out who they are and skagitriverqueen admits to looking for wildhartlivie on the net im sorry but this i will not ignore because its a safety issue even though srq was wrong about it being wildhartlivie she didnt know it this behavior has to stop i have heard stories about this kind of behavior and its not good just think user new york brad and 
 i was interested in are you sure thats right as hes an english composer and it was for a choir in basingstoke does this pastor have a connection with him or them perhaps you could supply your source of info i thinnk it is more likely to be the john lewis chain of shops 
 i have reverted my change as it is unclear ho exactly provided the funds 
 i saw that you are a quality engineer have you by chance taken any of 
 thank you 
 this is a followup message from earlier this year i just wanted to let you know that i passed the cqa test that i took on december N N 
 lets start getting some feelers on this maybe asq might have people on this as well i will post this on my membership listing to see who in asq bites 
 i have updated my asq profile to mention that i am a wikipedia editor earlier this morning 
 i contacted asq earlier today in regards to see if i can earn my retention units from wikipedia articles regarding quality i should have some information on this from them sometime tomorrow 
 i received a reply from asq earlier today they informed me that they will have the certification board review this proposal later this year in order for retention units to be done whethter this gets approves is unknown right now 
 off to school now thanks for the kind wishes 
 thank you olive i think it did go well i should find out within a week 
 just out of curiosity in what field is the phd 
 its in mathematics this particular qualifying exam covered algebra 
 hi i responded to you at the wikialert i saw what you wrote to 
 chill out im not attempting to validate the award claims which may indeed be dubious im just saying that the company does or did exist and they did indeed put out a legit product or two or did you miss the part where i agreed that the article should be deleted 
 for the record i bought it when it was relatively new at the store of a major software chain trust me as a cardcarrying deletionist im not in the habit of defending articles and im definitely not doing so here but i do believe in being fair about the facts when someone gets them wrong thats all peace 
 the categories probably need separate entries at cfd 
 thanks finngall you dont seem like a rogue admin i give you that 
 i appreciate you seeing the deletion tag i placed on epicfu and taking the proper action 
 failed to claim it was remarkable 
 i was referring to the 
 yes im just not sure that srq is actually following whl from article to article i think their areas of interest overlap in crime biographies and theres no rule against that theres a possibility of 
 i see what your saying i wish you luck on this i just know what i have seen the poking also needs to be stopped which is part of this problem if things can get civil i dont think there would be a problem anyways i will bow out for now at least and see if you can get things better than they have been good luck to all 
 the poking also needs to be stopped aaaaaamen it helps a little to remember that buttonpushing tends to be a response to feeling persecuted and powerless that feeling exists on both sides we are all made of the same stuff the catholics and protestants managed to stop shooting each other in ireland surely a few wikipedia editors can stop poking each other we are all on the same team and our common opponent is ignorance 
 you are right if it makes you feel better you put a smile on my face today have a good one 
 i want your thoughts on this you up for setting for a project dealing with quality and qualityrelated issues lets see if anyone else is interested 
 is the quality idea part of another project if so what i was not aware that it was under another project 
 i think it does need to go into the sciences project but it is an interdisciplinary type project similar to that of the library and information sciences and i think it should be its own separate project as a result cince it covers basic quality such as statistics auditing management and engineering and applied quality like food drug and cosmetic aerospace computers teams government and education lets start work on better formulaing our ideas and put up a proposal to create this project after the new year with both it and christmas close by merry christmas 
 hi i was raising some afds on redirect pages that contained the acronym iipm however by mistake i raised an afd on the above link can you help me undo it thanks 
 i think i have cleared up all the spurious pages let me know if i missed anything 
 thanks will check best 
 if he makes an effort to adapt then i will probably continue to try to help him otherwise his conflictresolution avoidance makes mediation impossible (no reply needed but ramble if you want to (the words of the day are 
 flxeN neur wow thats cool and i like any connotation or shade of meaning that baudelaire is personally responsible for that guy possessed a roommate of mine when i was an undergrad creepy im glad i wrote on 
 hello burzmali i dont largely object to this editthat you made to the 
 the article referenced is basically just a screed against homosexuality in the media that mentions bianca montgomery as an example i didnt think that the screed or the writer was notable in reference to the articles subject 
 okay i got you yeah i feel that that article is better without that as well thanks for the improvement 
 i understand but for the record when someone keeps shoving im making improvements to something with which you do not agree i dont think saying to stop do that is extreme not in the realm of what all has been said johnbonaccorsi myself and another editor worked for days and weeks to come up with agreeable wording and this seems assaultive to me especially since i do not agree with the improvements i have mostly stayed out of the fray simply because of the history with that editor however for the record i cant see that i would disagree with john on this 
 i didnt say it was extreme i think you can appreciate what im trying to do though yes 
 i do appreciate what you are trying to do id have to comment though that dropping the thought that other editors or administrators might be contacted to determine if an an or i report was necessary was fairly inflammatory the response to the protest about it was even worse those sorts of things are not at all progressive and invite conflict 
 i think theres truth in what you say i try to give uniform advice all around and you can be sure that i will notice and reply to any content that seems not to be focused on improving the article people need to vent when they are frustrated a big part of the trick is separating that from the work the cycle of remark followed by protest followed by response to protest etc uN that cycles got to be broken eventually or at least moved to somewhere else however until its actually time to file an an or i or wqa or rfc or u theres really not much to say thats going to help if we cant find a path to peaceful editing then its gonna have to escalate somewhere but im not close to that point yet i have seen worse problems worked out on this wiki 
 i find it pretty frustrating when someone new comes in and starts tearing everything apart editors dont seem to realize that to get an article to the shape the manson article is in takes a huge degree of discussion and consensus when someone comes in and starts rewriting it en masse not only does it invite disagreement it is insulting to the regular editors there it gets worse when the regular editors are disparaged for objecting john is the primary editor there followed by myself i guess hes the main authority around here on what sources say what its taken a lot of work to protect it from marauding pov editors and sometimes it is hard to tell who that is at first some of us actually vent via email some of us do a lot thanks 
 hello please be aware that when a citation includes a ref name such as it may be an anchor citation meaning that rather than removing the anchor you need to move it to another place in the article that is using it as an anchor when you removed it the result was an error message on the page to alert you to the problem i fixed this one but please be careful of this thanks 
 no problem sorry for sounding officious 
 thanks for contacting me i do see what you are trying to do but i have sincere doubts that skagitriverqueen will go along with that there was a lot of work done previously to that article most of which i watched and didnt join but it was hard work i find her writing to not be grammatical or interesting in anyway what i saw was bland and frequently incorrect thanks for contacting me 
 a question could i ask why you contacted wildhartlivie johnbonaccorsi and myself about this but i didnt see a posting to skagitriverqueen 
 yes thats a totally fair question srq and i are in touch via email but i could post something to her talk page here if that display of uniformity would be helpful i figure i have addressed her pretty directly right on the talk page too i get the feeling that she feels rather persecuted on that page and its good for her to see that im looking at everyones participation i understand that you have already gone through a lot of your patience in this situation but to do what i do i have got to make a goodfaith attempt to work it out without escalating to any formal dr if nothing works then i will be there to give a neutral account of how it all went wrong i dont assume we will go south though 
 theres no need to post to her page just to satisfy me i trust that you have talked to her i have to support what wildhartlivie said about new editors on pages that are fairly stable new editors dont appreciate bulldozer editing on established highprofile pages like the manson one i hope this can be resolved forgive me if im skeptical 
 has been marked resolved dustihowe and i have come to agreement as to how to move forward at this point you are welcome to contribute to the discussion at my 
 i have no issues with the resolution to this matter i have read the discussion on your talk page and all that matters to me is that disruptions to afd are minimized have a good day and best of luck to you and dustihowe 
 dftt 
 ok 
 hi gtbacchus i have two questions about archiving talk pages that i hope you can help me with N i set up mizabot iii on my talk page as per instructions provided but it still hasnt bothered to archive anything could you check my userpage for the script and hopefully tell me what i did wrong N could we have the 
 im comfortable with that talk page being archived but i know nothing about archive bots and their settings sorry i cant help with that 
 i should have commented here that i posted to docs page about the archiving no problem it should be ok now 
 thanks for getting back to me both of you > 
 im not really contesting the specific information just the presentation saying that he has only withdrawn is a qualitative statement which should really be supported by a secondary source could you just add the information to the table adding in the appropriate session 
 ohhhhh was that all i didnt even realize what the line projected moved into table 
 i want to add that this feels like bullying i ask that you stop 
 im trying to figure out why you have been yelling at me honestly you have seemed hostile from the start and i dont understand where you are coming from im completely ready to work together with you but so far you have avoided answering questions i have asked whats up im not trying to tell you what to do im trying to understand why you who clearly have other things to do in your life are doing something the extremely hard timeintensive way instead of the sensible quick way if you think a topic is nonnotable then nominating the article for deletion is the sensible way to react not nominating it for deletion means you want to spend enormously more time arguing about it that makes no sense if you think an article needs fixing you have many options many that are legal in terms of any policy you care to cite one option is to make the edit that needs to be made and then work from there another option is to simply yell at people arriving at the talk page who try to ask whats going on you seem to have chosen the latter and i dont know why my ears are wide open and i want to fix the article that you want to fix do you want to argue with me more or do you want to accept the support im offering you do you want to waste time or get something done why 
 are you trying to improve the article or to use its talk page as a forum to argue if you are trying to improve the article can you show me what edit youd like to see made so far i have seen you accuse and ip of being a sock i have seen you edit war and i have seen you ask a completely irrelevant question about whether reliable sources recommend the book when that has no connection to any policy that i know of 
 my activity through the month of january on this article shows i have worked to improve it by adding text i dont think the book is notable do you do you also think the argument against notability can be won 
 i have been offline for some time i think i took an entirely inappropriate tone on the talk page there and i apologize for going off on you i dont know whether the book is notable or not i think that the proper way to test that question is by running an afd which is a perfectly legitimate and goodfaith thing to do its how we question notability if simply asking the question on the talk page doesnt work there is a clear and objective criterion to meet if you are asserting the nonnotability of the book then you are saying it doesnt meet that criterion thats what you are saying right in that case i can see no reason to delay the articles deletion we are not trying to keep articles on nonnotable topics so people can argue about them flush it out and get on with something notable if on the other hand the book does meet our notability criterion then theres no sense continuing to claim that its nonnotable its not really a matter of opinion the criterion is objective thus theres no sense arguing about it we just answer the question yes or no 
 i think talking on the talk page did some good in that it forced out links to reliable sources who reviewed the book i reviewed the links and added them to the article i dont know whether they have been reverted ronz said the objective criterion for notability is two rs when that criterion was met i agreed that it met that standard the issue now on that page is whether that long list of N people can be readded to the page i have argued that running it alone without responses from each person called dangerous violates blp some people agreed and others say there is no consensus for that claim what do you think 
 i dont understand why adding the list without also including responses is even on the table why not just add the list and critical responses whether mentioning someones presence on the list alone violates blp is a question id like to see asked before a larger audience i havent personally seen how we handle any similar cases id be curious what people at 
 hi i noticed a template space redirect you created redirects to since no articles are currently using id like to propose redirecting to the anti
 hi agreed i have made the change 
 hi tib and thanks i would like the same too but as far as i can tell the sidebar has its own special syntax that only allows headings and links hence the only way to add it is by editing the monobookphp skin file 
 hello since this is the english wikipedia i dont think it makes sense to have discussions in romanian language we certainly do not allow articles in foreign languages and i think the same rule makes sense for talk pages 
 i was wondering what you thought of something the 
 im honestly not completely sure to begin with i was in total agreement with you but lykantrop has made a few good points however im making it out to be more than it is nwoahm just seems to be little more than an umbrella term covering groove metalcore and possibly either elements of thrash or melodeath at best the same way extreme metal covers thrash doom black and death for all intents and purposes id have to agree with you over lykantrop for the most part it does just seem to be metalcore and its varients on the one hand it is a bit of a neologism on the other lykantrop has done a fine job of sourcing the article so im a bit on the fence so much so that i have mostly chosen not to get involved i dont support lykantrop enough to defend the article and although i am more on your side of the fence than his i dont truly oppose the article enough to nominate it for deletion uN 
 alright fair enough well if it gets nominated for deletion i will let you know and you can feel free to discuss it at the afd at that time if you wish 
 regards 
 the hero gray the robin refs does not look right even now worse than op cit isnt there a better way of doing it to repeat the title and isbn etc N times is not mos as far as i know cheers 
 almost sure it is using and a formatted ref 
 gday i agree and i think using a short reference may be the way to do it per 
 sorry to be a nuisance about it my hero does not deserve overlinked refs the best eg i could find that i have recently looked at is at http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or murchison_river_ i gotta get off now but will keep educating myself how to do it trust the hobart weather is better than perth is at the mo cheers and catch up some other time 
 just fyi you had recently issued a last warning to 
 i thank you for bringing this to my attention and i will keep a close eye out for unfortunately i am not an administrator so i cant block users but i can put this user on my watchlist and on my blacklist at 
 hi gtbacchus just tried editing same said you deleted then restored it wondering whats up 
 well that was a little bit more than N years ago i repaired a cutandpaste move that someone had done probably when i was working in 
 not anymore weird thing is i got the message about you deleting then restoring it while i edited on april N th N three years later either theres something i dont get or maybe we should check for ektoplasma anyhow no probs now thnx 
 excuse me i gave an explanation in the edit summary and there not much chance that you will find any more articles to create links from please dont use this patronizing warning i have been editing on wikipedia for years 
 i gave the reason in the edit summary the website is not in english language 
 hi the logs indicate that this article has been deleted and then recreated three or four times and most recently deleted by you an hour ago fyi 
 yeah thanks i only noticed the previous deletions after i deleted it is there something i should be doing because of this 
 i see that you reverted the deletion of the image i wasnt sure about this so had already raised it at 
 yeah i was a bit unsure too i figured we will decide what to do if he comes back 
 on would be appreciated do you think im right in thinking an rm is necessary there 
 i have replied there in context i hope thats helpful 
 there is a discussion at 
 addendum there is a small discussion regarding the disposition of the project see 
 how is suggesting that she could have a checkuser file an abuse report feeding the trolls 
 theres a person repeatedly vandalising that page and there were two separate threads talking about the vandalism reporting them to their isp etc thats the kind of attention they thrive on its best just to get rid of it and deny them any kind of attention 
 i was trying to be helpful and empower her with the ability to fight back against these jerks filing abuse reports with the related isps seems like a much better solution to someone being regularly harassed than playing this game of blocking ips and removing their trolling and pretending it doesnt happen the isps can revoke their internet access the harassment and trolling problem is getting worse not better and deny and dnftt dont seem to be working we need to do more than just play defense all the time thats more or less how 
 plenty of people have made plenty of complaints to this guys isp before you can see how that worked out if you want to make a complaint then i can give you limited technical data so you know who to complain to and what to say until then we need to continue on as we are doing 
 oh the isp is unresponsive ok thanks for explaining 
 if you want to complain to them anyway feel free i will give you some technical evidence for the report 
 there are no disambiguation guidelines that recommend removing links to ambiguous articles from disambiguation pages the examples of set index articles in the guidelines do not indicate that they must not overlap with disambiguations you appear to be the only editor reverting the additions on 
 there is no clear evidence that other editors know what they are doing if we go down this path it must be consistent that means changing signal mountain article since it is the one mentioned on the guidelines also all the other black xxx days articles and any other articles like it 
 agreed but that other things also need to be fixed is no reason not to fix things 
 if i had known that commons administrators would delete them i never would have transwikied them in the first place 
 i have some photos of my own from last year but can i assume that i cant release them as public domain i have a photo of the mural park too that i could upload but it doesnt look like much from a wide perspective 
 i have just noticed your page states you do photo upload requests and i was wondering next time you are down 
 sounds like an interesting challenge i will see what i can come up with 
 please do not without addressing the issues in question the introduction to the article completely omits coverage of the subjects features and the whole article is written in a promotional tone i will be retagging this the article needs a lot of work especially considering that the linux gazette article is the single solitary reliable secondary source currently included in it 
 i did not simply remove the tags without addressing the issues i removed them because i disagreed with the need for them sure the article can be improved which you can do but i dont see such major problems that we need to slap a massive notice at the top 
 if you disagree with the concept of cleanup tags please feel free to argue against them at 
 i meant i disagreed with the need for them on this particular page 
 in that case i would suggest that you reexamine 
 wow what a lot of drama direktor if theirrulez is acting in a way that compromises the english wikipedia and if this is only visible by looking at his contributions across many articles then i hope you will have some time and energy to set up an rfc or u (
 none of the above is fictitious or a way for me to avoid discussion this is areal and it should not be ignored if you dont mind me saying so i simply think you should be informed of the big picture since you seem to be getting into this thats all 
 direktor i dont think its fictitious i just think you are addressing the problem in the wrong venue there are two entirely separate issues here what should the article about fv be called what about theirrulez if you wish to address issue #N there is a whole world of procedures set up for you to do that i am no part of that world im only available for article editing and titling issues if theres a problem with theirrulez then you need to set up an rfc or u and deal with it that way on the other hand if the article on fv is to stay at a croatian title then it needs to be clear that hes more notable in english literature with a croatian name than with an italian one do you notice how that criterion makes no mention of any editor by name yeah i understand that you are very frustrated by the actions of a set of editors however we cant make decisions about articles based on who certain editors may be or what agendas they may have decisions about articles are based on sources full stop if the article should have a croatian name then prove it with sources otherwise its going to have an italian name because it currently appears that fv is more notable in the english literature as an italian engineer than he is as a croatian lexicographer do you understand where im coming from here direktor i dont lack sympathy i just separate one issue from another and im not the person to deal with the other issue 
 i just editconflicted with this paragraph and i have no idea who typed it or what its about give me N minutes and i will comment 
 you know theirrulez the best response to reversions is to impersonally and impassionately document the edits you wish to make on the talk page per 
 you are right its not helpful 
 thank you for reverting vandalism on wikipedia be sure to put warning tags on the vandals user talk page (such as {{
 sure i didnt mean to sound condescending because i know you know what to do in this situation but i realized that after i clicked save so my appologies i think replacing big blocks of content with is gay is definitely vandalism and not merely a test thanks and happy editing 
 so what is deletable about robin buying shares 
 nothing 
 methinks gay will get booted and rrobin might get the next chair i put the abc item back but left it without comment ahh to be back in a queenie pub to hear what the locals think about the current lot of hobart suits or N N march N 
 i just came from rm to close 
 thank you i hope so too it can be difficult to jumpstart the editing process once its become bogged down in personal disputes any success that i might have is due in large part to the myriad mistakes i have made trying to do this sort of thing in the past the trick as with so many things is to keep getting back up 
 yes he definitely deserved the award 
 thank you salvio i hope you havent spoken too soon i dont know if the discussion on that talk page can be pulled away from the personal and towards the professional how does one convince people to stop talking about each other and start talking about edits in a neutral and academic manner i dont know ( nevertheless i appreciate the vote of confidence 
 i meant my above posts to be more of an insight into the context of the issue on wiki rather than a comment on any specific user i apologize i merely thought such info might be useful 
 im not sure how its going to be useful to me i mean addressing editor conduct is best done in a different venue such as 
 to be honest the 
 i dont see how an open rm can cause editwarring the solution to editwarring is easy dont do it my concern with simply closing the move request is that people wont take a more constructive attitude they will just go away arguing is easier than improving articles and apparently more satisfying on some level if you disagree with a round of edits why not break the dispute down into small bitesized pieces and start a talk page section to discuss them neutrally and impersonally how is an open rm preventing you or anyone else from doing that 
 while i dont dispute the validity of your statement that people are here because they are arguing a point a wprm is in my view no way to encourage article development why people might leave if its closed but even if we disregard the constant unavoidable conflicts if such was the motivation for article improvement their contributions up to that point will be biased in a way that supports their pov about the title finally is it really ok to motivate people by holding an rm open in my experience on wiki very little or no good can come from this sort of atmosphere 
 its entirely in your hands whether any good can come of it all you have to do is rise to the occasion whether or not its ok to motivate people by holding an rm open its something to try and you are certainly in a position to guarantee that it doesnt work if thats what you want to do you also have the power to make it work if i close the rm today the article will be titled fausto veranzio is that really what you are trying to ask for its in your hands to make this productive you have the power whats your choice is it to argue with me about procedure rather than improving the article thats what you are doing now direct this energy towards the article and things will magically start getting a lot better im a tenacious arguer and this can drag out for weeks is that your goal why arent you posting about specific edits on the talk page why not oppose the edits you dont like in the constructive way rather than by reverting does that really just not interest you at all dont you want to see the article improve what are you doing to make that happen 
 as 
 in the trilateration article it is certainly meaningful to state as used in this article since it alerts readers to the fact that there is different usage in some other articles the definition you put up is vague ambiguous and confusing read the talk page 
 saying as used in this article simply means the definition given is not sufficient fix the definition and we wont have any problem 
 im sorry you feel that way i will not be continuing this conversation any further due to your 
 please dont get me wrong im not complaining im just interested why did you cheers 
 links to this website were added to several pages in a manner that looked like spam there is a conflict of interest because the username of the editor indicates the operator of the website is adding links to his own site 
 cheers 
 added an image to the above article and noticed the name includes an 
 would contacting the shire of macedon ranges for confirmation of the legal name be or if not i am happy to email them and ask with any luck they will reply the name is not a big deal but we may as well get it right 
 the gazette seems to me to be the definitive source and i suggest the name be changed to reflect this i am happy to start if you have no objections 
 thanks for the research and mdashits good to get lucky once in a while and mdashand for picking up the nontranscluded links i missed cheers 
 hi barry im looking at the source link provided but it does not show the image being used what page was the image pulled from and does that page have the same creative commons licensing also what about rs thanks 
 for both people there is an attachment section underneath the photo you see where they have a downloadable file that file seems to be part of the rest of the site and under the cc license cheers 
 ahh thanks common sense would say that when theres a hyperlink to an image underneath an image its of that image 
 there is no such thing as an in house style for wikipedia nor is there a list of authorised styles any citation style is an acceptable one the one in 
 why not follow the style used in the wpref how about following the recommendations at 
 your modifications to selected references georgia waters layabouts plank their way across town in latest net craze sydney morning herald N may N 
 they refer to a set of citation styles the ones they refer to are the ones that shouldnt be changed between you can just choose any citation style you want and expect everyone to follow there has to be some consistency across the site the most notable feature of your citation style is the available online links they stand out like a sore thumb it makes it looks like there is some big deal that an articles is available online which these days is not such a big deal it also makes the page more cluttered the policy recommends embedding links in the title instead for good reason 
 actually you can choose any style and expect others to follow see fac or the variety of fa styles any consistent style the article had an internally consistent style set prior to your mucking with it also if you are going to stuff up the consistent style i presented then finish the job the article still contains author title location publisher locationintext notes and your author title date notes you have left the articles citation style consistency half broken good job as far as available online see turabian i strongly suggest you selfrevert to the previously internally consistent style 
 you have been mentioned at 
 i have never seen something go beyond an or i myself and i find it hard to believe the other two hadnt been tried by now or is it a casebycase thing 
 check it out 
 nobodys ever done an rfc on him youd think thered have been one i mean hes been this way for ages 
 i was a little surprised actually someone started one last fall but there wasnt a second endorser within N hours and the person filing it withdrew the request so it was deleted its an interesting read the lesson seems to be if you are going to do it do it right 
 for ages all my life in fact 
 do not reduce the quality of citations to bare weblinks as you did while merging planking and lying down game 
 dont tell me what to do i have my reasons 
 your reasons can be anything you please but the fact of the matter is in contradiction of policy you merged the articles while reducing fully cited works to bare weblinks i made no assumption of your faith or reason but merely noted your actions to you 
 you have violated policy by including unreliable references 
 i guess this is as good a place as any to bring this up i take umbrage with the fatalistic attitude you espoused on the wqa talk page to think that an admin would counsel another not to bother with preventative measures because they most likely wont work is very disheartening they will by the very definition of reality not work if you dont ever use them how is one to go through the motions if one never goes through the motions we cant present evidence that doesnt exist we cant report to arbcom how every time he gets blocked it gets overturned if no one ever blocks him because they know it will get overturned do you see the catchN you are asking the community to accept in short you are asking the community to accept the attitude of this editor because fighting it would mean work then what did you become an admin for to shirk responsibility to avoid conflict to shy away 
 if you bother to familiarize yourself in the very least with my record you will find that i wade regularly into conflicts that most other admins shun like the plague you clearly dont know anything about me except that i opined that my blocking malleus fatuorum would be pointless at this juncture if you are going to accuse me of avoiding conflict do a tiny bit of homework first shit just look at this talk page and tell me im an avoider of conflict what a laugh if you want to know how i think someone could aresponsibly and effectively address malleus behavior then you are welcome to ask that question what you posted here so far though is just nonsense you think im counseling people not to bother with preventative measures reread my posts at wqa and come back when you have some idea of what i actually said the only measures i counsel people not to bother with are the ones that empirically fail over and over again i suppose you think i should bash my head into a wall to get through when i know damn well where the door is how absurd 
 first off sorry about your talk page second you will forgive me for not doing several hours of research when you were plainly espousing your theories of the way reality works for all to see i dont as has been alluded to expect you to act as an xfcbermensch but when well respected admins post things like the point is that the unsoundness of the arguments create the dramafest that renders the block pointless it disheartens the general populous and then to make others feel impotent by telling them demands that you cant back up are hollow can leave people feeling completely helpless what are we supposed to do in an anonymous environment that statement alone weighs heavy on me because it tells me that you believe there is ultimately no real recourse any of us have that is significant in any way the closest you have come to being helpful is to tell someone else to file an rfc only to crush them when they got here by revealing the futility of doing so i hope you can see how this all combines to give the allusion that there is no point in taking administrative action because its never going to work you say above not to bother with measures that dont empirically work but spend the prior day showing others how none of the options at their disposal will work thus my disheartened attitude toward corrective action on wp if as opposed to what i have supplied above you are in fact in favor of regulating the communitys general attitude then i apologize for misreading your intentions however the irony of having an admin that selfadmittedly does not use their administrative powers balk at being blamed for not using their administrative powers is not lost on me 
 ok i can see that i have been less than clear about all this for a difficult and wellestablished user its very difficult to do anything but its not impossible simply throwing a block at someone like malleus for incivility is not a good idea taking him to wqa is not a good idea arguing with him as i did yesterday while satisfying on a certain level is not a good idea filing a hasty rfc that gets deleted after a few days is not a good idea here are ideas that could possibly have some effect lead by example by this i mean in context where there is tendentious editing going on use effective communication and dispute resolution skills where he will see the effects if hes going to change his style it will be a result of seeing someone get some real work done in a style that is a little bit more collegial than his own if that happens enough times then he would probably move slightly in that direction this is a long slow incremental process which makes it not very satisfying and also carries the risk that for every inch of progress theres a foot of backsliding still this is probably the best option on some level if option seems not to be working theres the dispute resolution avenue it would start with option a properly filed rfc as i said on this page talking about last falls failed rfc if you are going to do it do it right that means the following choose the right context approach it as a tool of assistance and not as a weapon be prepared to run lots of damage control be prepared for the possibility that it will take N or three iterations to have any effect i could say more to unpack what each of those means and if you want me to just ask finally i was in a rotten combative mood yesterday when you posted to my page asking questions such as then what did you become an admin for to shirk responsibility to avoid conflict to shy away which i find to be goading and sarcastic thats why i replied irritably which i realize was not helpful im sorry about that it is better in such a situation if i just go away from the wiki for a while and come back when im prepared to suck up the apparent sarcasm and answer with a better tone i hope that i have now said something that addresses your valid concerns if i can say more please let me know also i thank you for bringing these concerns to me attention and i truly will think about what you have said 
 id like to clarify two further points first regarding my use of admin powers i dont see myself as a cop nor do i consider myself to be charged as an admin with regulating the communitys general attitude i think that when admins try to play cop it goes badly almost all the time a far better way to regulate general attitude is available to any editor namely lead by example i do engage in dispute resolution work and i dont use my buttons when im doing that i engage as an informal mediator who can talk to disagreeing parties and help find a way through the dispute if they are more inclined to listen to me because im an admin i think thats a little bit silly because im really just an editor with some extra buttons i try to lead by example rather than compelling by force yesterdays wqa meltdown turned out to be a poor example of that and im doing my best to learn from the experience i do use the buttons i delete pages quite regularly as part of the housekeeping work of carrying out pagemoves you can see my deletion log i seldom complete speedy deletion requests or close afds thats just not where i have happened to specialize but i do it on occasion i also use the block button you can see my block log i dont block established users i think that usually does more harm than good but i block common vandals which are either brand new accounts or unregistered editors i dont do it often because in the work that i specialize in it doesnt generally come up like i said i just wanted to clarify that im not someone who selfadmittedly does not use their administrative powers i just dont use them in ways that i believe to be counterproductive i use the mop as a 
 fair enough i must admit that i have had dealings with malleus in the past and seeing him continue to act the way he does only to be met with a sheepish well what are you going to do gave me a kneejerk reaction i could have seen more if i had read more heres hoping option N will work one of these days 
 interesting to see the vultures beginning to circle but its premature the bodys not dead yet 
 what what vultures what are you talking about are you trying to suggest that the above is a machination designed to result in your eventual banning then why would i post it here what possible use could come of it why would i start now why would i not interract with you for lo these many months and then start this what is the twisted reasoning behind that thanks for the vote of confidence but im not nearly that machiavellian 
 just a coincidence then obviously 
 this shows just how amazing the social interaction dynamics of an open wiki can be some thoughtful ruminations by an admin on a very visible page such as wqa can lead other users to forcefully disagree with his opinions and call him to task as shirking his responsibilities which in turn you fill in the rest the 
 its obvious whats happening and equally obvious that nobody is honest enough to own up to it 
 fascinating if you were a philosopher you would be a cynical one time will tell in the process i may join you in the ranks of the cynics sometime in the future although i will try to hold out for a little while 
 had i been born in the right timeframe and to the right parents i would very likely have been the founder of the cynics 
 took it right out of my mouth 
 i have handled most of them now thanks for the heads up 
 haha thanks for signing my name for me for some reason i just forgot to sign my name in the slugging percentage page so yeah thanks 
 no problem it happens i just like it to be clear who says what so i use the unsigned template quite a bit 
 i have moved these pages back because choujuu and chouriki are the more common names and the names we only use the hepburn spelling of the first name if that is what the series uses (see 
 the link that you gave me doesnt use the proper hepburn spellings of kyouryuu and choujin either i wouldnt give it much weight since it seems to be a very informal list and a lot of those suggested international titles arent even actually used in the foreign market (nobody actually calls 
 it doesnt matter because kyuN dryuN b and chuN djin appear in the show as well as on the toys in english the other spellings exist because they are the 
 its not english its romanized japanese but whatever my point is that japanese companies are very inconsistent at romanizing names they might use a spelling at one point only to switch to another spelling in a different instance for example the name of the villain group from 
 if reliable sources use the wapuro style we go with that and common usage trumps any other naming guideline as it is a policy aspect and it is clear that it should be two words because that is how it is formatted in almost every regard except in rare cases uN 
 im only asked that because on zyuranger itself the dyno bucklers have kyoruN bsentai as one word as does the ohranger soundtrack that i showed you i wasnt actually suggesting to move them into one words just making a rhetorical question either way i still think hepburn should be given preferences over pseudowapuro for formality sakes if theres no official romanization 
 regardless of what you think the common practice for dealing with these names is to use the wapuro system unless an official name is used and what toei shows us in the link i gave you shows that for shows that dont have spellings plastered all over the merch that our method matches theirsuN 
 hi stephen or alzarian i just came to wish you happy birthday merry christmas and good new year may all your wishes come true antonxedn 
 everyones being so nice to me lately it makes me think i must be doing something wrong seriously thank you i will have to think of some wishes now 
 i would prefer that you gentlemen use my talk page to communicate directly with me if you simply wish to chat about potential past lives you have each got your own talk page i will cheerfully and honestly answer any direct questions about my actions at wqa or my actions anywhere else on wikipedia your conspiracy theories are as childish as how you handle frivolous talk page warnings malleus the way you handled the last stupid and clueless talk page warning from whatsisname led to a fucking volcano and you say that rational people act in ways that are likely to lead to desired results what a joke 
 sorry for intruding on your talk page but i thought my very first edit was a genuine contribution in analysing the dynamics that a seemingly innocuous selfreflection but on a highvisibility page like wqa of a powerful figure like an admin could have for the mere mortals of wikipedia sorry if i just relaxed too much and followedup with a few comments in the wrong direction however i would think that as an admin you could encourage a few relaxing exchanges between users on your talkpage as they promote goodwill and reflection perhaps a few good ideas or solutions but you are the boss here and who am i to argue against your local regulations 
 drk i am interested in what you were saying im not interested in playing guessing games though whats the you fill in the rest part im honestly interested to know because i care about the effects of my actions 
 i generally am quite okay with relaxed exchanges on my talk page but im not not interested in what i consider juvenile nonsense from malleus i am interested in what you have to say and i apologize if i was overly dismissive you were standing next to him sorry 
 thank you gtbacchus for starters my respect for you is immense and i will tell you why long time ago i butted in your talkpage to congratulate you and another user on the stance you took on a subject but i do not recall what it was about i was so impressed with your thinking that ever since i respected you greatly the past few days i saw the exchanges at wqa and i appreciated the logic of many of your arguments especially the later ones but given my respect for you it came as no surprise to me then when malleus visited your talkpage and put forward a few arguments it suddenly struck me for starters i was and still am absolutely certain that you by going to wqa wanted to examine deeply and sincerely some issues and you acted in a most human but unadminlike way by admitting a few weaknesses and an inability to solve issues nothing wrong with that at all except wikipedia is a panopticon your edits are seen by everyone and reverbate through the whole system especially if made at highly visible fora such as wqa thats all it takes after that you get the pressure that you are not acting as an ubermensch you are not decisive you admit failure etc etc what must you do now suddenly the bodywikipolitic is after you for answers to not abuse your hospitality further i will cut to the chase you see powerful figures are not supposed to ruminate in public that makes the public nervous your comments are amplified through the system and then the residents of that system since you hold a position of power in this system demand action if they dont get it they become angry first with you then with the subject of your inquiry in this case malleus so ruminating in wqa is effectively like a call to arms against the subject of said contemplation after this i cannot predict what will happen per wpcrystal but i hope you get my drift anyway it was great talking to you and thanks for the invitation 
 thank you drk those are some very interesting observations which i hadnt thought about its funny because i dont necessarily see myself as being in a position of power i almost never block anyone i think i have blocked an established user one time i only delete pages as part of the housekeeping of carrying out move requests i dont protect pages i dont frequent ani you get the idea however the old concept of adminship being not a big deal is false it clearly is a big deal to a lot of people and i could do well to be more conscious of that i also try to keep the 
 no need to thank me at all gtbacchus the pleasure was all mine i dont normally engage is such long conversations but with the right editors those i deeply respect and of course you are one of them i am motivated to discuss a few interesting points this systemrelated effect was a surprise for me as well i had never thought about it this way before so it is my turn to thank you for a stimulating conversation that you also appreciated my comments and you thanked me was an unexpected but very welcome bonus take care gt and see you around 
 i dont recall threatening anyone just thought you would be interested in knowing you were showing up in vp boxes as a red user also i noted that your reverts yesterday were done using twinkle which is a vandal tool not a content dispute tool the edits you reverted were not vandalism they werent even close to vandalism had you used your rollback rights to revert those edits your rollback rights would have been taken away from you almost instantly rollback was a very testy subject when it was first introduced and many admins actually quit the project over editors being given those rights because of the chance of abuse of it rollback is no different than twinkle they have a single purpose and it isnt for reverting the contributions of another or in your case many others just because they have reached a format agreement that differs from your own pov if an admin sees that you are using twinkle in a content dispute it wouldnt surprise me in the least if they decided to remove the rollback rights just as a precaution come out from under navlos bridge ps whois isnt very accurate use geobytes it will pinpointnt your ips right down to the nearest street corner its a much better tool for determining ip location hope that helps 
 firstly twinkle is not a tool designed only for vandals which is why theres an agf option on it secondly i wasnt using the rollback nor the rollback vandalism function i was simply using the revert to this edit function which is little more than a quicker way of loading the earlier edit and saving it there was no abuse of twinkle involved my mention of your threats was more ambiguous in my humble opinion you sounded rather threatening in your previous message although whois at least separated the various ips still i find it rather coincidental that the same edits are made by ips at the same time uN 
 i have been editing here for four years in over N edits i have never seen anyone ring up a $N phone bill just to prove a 
 four years and N edits not that im calling you a liar or anything but with what account or ip address did you do all these edits uN 
 i am libs you dont know who libs is have you been stuck under a wiki rock the editor navlos refers to as the N ip man i have been here as long as there has been a wikipedia to be here for under my original account i rolled over N edits in my first year alone and i was prompted and i quickly rejected N attempts to nominate me as an admin when i saw a growing trend of antianon happening something i felt went against what wikipedia stood for i rejected my original account and began to edit under the purity of anonymity after N edits as an anon i decided just recently to join the logged in population again with this account which was named after N things my ip nickname libs and the naming format wiki libs is a tip of the hat to my good friend longtime administrator wiki alf admin bubba hotep was the one who originally dubbed me libs a name which has stuck for almost N years i do not work within the regular channels of wikipedia i find wpani wpaiv and other noticeboards to be roadblocks when trying to get something done quick i cant count the number of admins i have as msn friends when i want someone blocked from editing i dont bother with ani its too slow N quick email or chat post and any editor i find to be an offending thorn is gone that being said i do not use that route very often since many people agfd for me when i was a lowly anon i tend to agf even the worst of trolls if i feel there may be some glimmer of hope on their wikifuture i had actuallt quit wikpedia just recently over a gross admin blunder which i felt scarred the project beyond hope it was only after receiving over N emails from other wikipedia editors asking me to return that i decided to don the wiki libs hat and come back to the project hope that explains the libsyhistory a little feel free to ask for help anytime you want i do not contribute with the same fervour that i used to but i am usually not too far away 
 i see dont get me wrong i wasnt about to 
 thats nice 
 hi i just decided to check the claim of N and added the population of helsinki to those of espoo vantaa and kauniainen the sum was N i meant to present the sources but forgot 
 ok i have now made some edits that hopefully improve the article 
 i think we now see your true colours gtbacchus just another abusive administrator who ought to be be relieved of his utility belt for his own safety 
 please malleus there is no basis for that i will reply to gtbacchus next but my typing skills are not that great 
 make it happen then money where mouth is 
 start your rfc and then its game on matey 
 i see you are empty and full of wind money where mouth is you cant do it and you know it you were dead wrong about whatshisname and now you are just full of wind please go away until you are ready to have me desysopped full of 
 you are clearly a fool like every other sane member of this community i recognise that not even death will be able to wrench that admin utility belt from you 
 at least i hardly ever use the tools except for housecleaning i feel honored that you consider me a fool come back when you are ready to put your money where your mouth is cowardly child nothing but wind 
 you missed the point you can call me a cowardly child but i cant call someone a sycophantic wannabee im afraid that that you will just have to live with the fact that you are a dishonest twat 
 i have never said you cant call someone anything you can do whatever you want it might be very stupid but you can still do it i wont block you if you are not a coward put your money where your mouth is and get me desysopped do it child oh and point to anything dishonest i have said child 
 ask yourself this gtbacchus if those comments were to have been posted on your rfa do you believe youd have garnered enough support 
 i couldnt possibly pass an rfa today anyhow the expectations placed on admin candidates are very different now than they were in N that isnt quite what you asked though what you see here is what happens one of the four or so times that i got angry on wikipedia it turns out that i can be pushed to the point that i hit back i dont like it im not proud of it im also still angry with malleus and im not going to talk to him anymore today or this week i would hope and this is probably too much to ask that anyone wanting to form a picture of my character would take a broader view than one snapshot of me when i was really ticked off i hope they would look at the responses im posting this morning for example and see how i go about picking up the pieces the next day after i have experienced a regrettable human failing in public view that said i have been for a long time an administrator open to recall if the community judges me unfit for the tools if that happens i wont fight i hope i have answered your question 
 see 
 im afraid i dont understand the question are you asking me why i blocked 
 i am glad you two are fast becoming friends wonderful 
 i know right if it were anyone else it would be horrible but i think this is how you bond with the guy kisses malleus mwaaah i dont kiss men ysee 
 then you know nothing im prepared to believe that your opinion is honestly held but its not honest trying to get rid of poor admins is an exercise in futility 
 i have seen many desysopped you want a list 
 the list is rather a short one i dont think that you are a bad person who ought to be desysopped i just think that you are an idiot 
 please stop posting here already you are the idiot who utterly failed to predict what would happen after you told the guy to fuck off because you are ignorant you failed and you cant goddamned stand it now leave me alone 
 just look at yourself gtbacchus you are a disgrace you condemn others for doing what you do yourself 
 my apologies to gtbacchus for butting in like this but malleus please disengage from this exchange there is no gain whatever to continue along these lines it was simplistic of me to think that the quality of this conversation was improving just a while ago when i became hopeful that you might reach some understanding i lost hope as the sniping went on and now it has escalated to intolerable levels malleus imo from all your possible problems here gtbacchus should be one of the least significant do not try to find a definitive answer to something that may be very difficult to define please do not pursue this any further i know my foray in peaceful diplomacy may be in vain but at least i thought i should give it a try

 appreciate the help i will back out for a while this is something im working on for a project thanks for the assistance 
 that one was downright awful i added mostly references and templates for the books im using todayhadnt tore into the lead yetyou did a great job 
 nice touches to the leadi rewrote the venomous part the provocative theories of dr fry asidethe vast majority of snakes are not venomous also the prey aspect i think is better suited to individual species articlesfor example i can think of N species that are small enough to only eat worms slugs and centipedes as well as species that eat only fish eggs other snakes etc articles on rat snakes milk snakes pine snakes and smaller pythons and rattlesnakes would deserve too have prey in their lead i think when speaking of the almost N diferent species that carnivorous is good enough i literally type this in a room full of lizards of which in this case only N are insectivores whereas the rest are vegetarian or omnivores so i took out that comparison to lizards 
 you werent that far offjust a bit too specific like i said above again great job and thanks for the helpwhen writing about animals i revert back to scientist mode so i often need a good wordsmith like yourself helping me out 
 ah alright then probably should have read that well the uploaders gone so if you find it useless then nevermind it will get deleted 
 i think there is somthing wrong with the template right next to the bold word administrators the link to checkuser just displays usernames with the word checkuser in it but not accounts with checkuser privileges should it be 
 you are quite right i remember quite clearly that i copied the code from 
 thanks i fixed the problem on a few other templates 
 enjoy it i made it myself 
 you really did make it yourself thank you john i will strive to be worthy of it 
 i understand you are on wikibreak but on the offchance you are around and being aware that you are cool as a cucumber may i invite you over to 
 thanks in advance 
 let me know if its still ok for you to work it out or if you want to give up thanks 
 thanks for the note i just get frustrated sometimes im not giving up on the article i still want to add more from the source i obtained via the library but im done arguing with direktor over how we have done the move request im not sure when i will be able to look there but it will be soon 
 kay nobody is in hurry i suppose and before arguing more and more remeber 
 hey haunted angel libs here again adding a quick post unlogged for your benefit i noticed your paranoia page and also noticed your inclusion of my name on it so i thought i would post this little note just to ease you mind a little where my global whereabouts were you may go ahead with any sort of rcu you wish with my wiki libs username and tswx and the different british and australian and western canadian editors but as you can see for yourself N x is about as far east in north america as anyone can get without being in the atlantic ocean and just to give you a little more info here is a partial list of all the ips i have ever edited from N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N there may be a few more i never actually tracked my own ips an admin friend compiled that list for me if you can prove that tswx has used any one of those ips i would leave wikipedia forever it is my belief that tswx lives on continental europe i vaguely remember reading somewhere he had posted that he was swiss i do not dislike navlos i am simply fed up with his trolling and his ignorance of all assistance to improve as an editor and not be so dispised by the community when he first started i offered him my help many times but my offers were rejected and he spiraled down into the editor that we have all come to know if i really disliked him i would have had him banned ages ago my agf is that he will become a positive editor someday he will never be acccepted completely or trusted completely as his youth and temper always seem to get the better of him but he may at least get to a stage where N per cent of his edits have to be reverted as totally useless which is where is is right now by his own hand as for commas vs linebreaks i actually use both i am the only editor who ever proposed a compromise that would satisfy both camps the comma supporters clearly have a majority but the code supporters were more vocal and hardheaded my compromise was simple if there were only N genres listed then a line break was adaquate if there were N or more genres listed then a comma should be used in order to keep the box from getting too long and there there was a dispute over genres and citations had to be added then the genres with references were easier viewed using linebreaks now you can see that was a pretty clear headed proposal on my part one that would satisfy eveyone it can never be one or the other there has to be compromise and my plan was simple and perfect but it slipped through the cracks so regardless of what either camp wishes to see my rule is the rule i follow and everyone else can pretty much go to hll on it because both camps have been nothing but babies about the whole stupid argument want to help wikipedia progress follow my rule of thumb its simple its easy to follow it promotes positive progress instead of edit wars it even promotes the only rule that the genre box ever had in the first place aim for generality if a linebreak supporter really wanted to use a br code so bad they would be forced to clean up some of the superfluous genres just to get it down to N so that they could use their little code even young navlos should be able to follow that rule dont you think good luck in your editing feel free to ask for my help and have a nice day wiki libs 
 paranoia page well my friend you are welcome to call it paranoia if you wish but i personally wouldnt go that far and would simply call it scepticism of course i realise it initially looks absurd the idea that editors from across the globe are the same person but even though im surely on my way to mental insanity i dont think i have quite reached it yet and still maintain that it is still very odd that numerous ips edit the same thing on their first edit at the same time who knows perhaps its simply a few people who have friends on an instant messenger or some forum who happen to live on opposite ends of the world who are doing this this is of course mere speculation and is certainly approaching paranoiai am actually quite loathed to put twsxs name up there not because i have anything against him but rather for the opposite reason i have spoken with twsx numerous times and he seems like a sensible upstanding user who is far to mature to do the things i have suggested as the page says he is there more for reference than anythingi do thank you for your extensive list of ips due to the huge number and the fact that i havnt encountered any previously in the line break or comma war i wont be adding them to my page but your cooperation in this matter is still appreciated again please dont feel offended that your name is there but for the moment id like to keep any user names that have taken part in this war in one place simply for reference im not so convinced that you are any of those ips as your ip page is rather well decorated with barn stars and the like and you do seem trusted however and please do not think im assuming bad faith or simply being paranoid i would just like to ensure that i know whos who and who is doing whatyes your idea of what the consensus should be does sound good but in my humble opinion may look like there is no mos at first glance you may have guessed that i am in favour of line breaks but i can assure you if the consensus was hands down that infoboxes should all have commas then i would change every article i saw to commas without complaint i simply wish there to be one agreed upon style you may find it hard to believe but navnlxfN s also feels the same way he may prefer the line breaks but he has stated that if the consensus was commas he would enforce it 
 i asked for a third opinion on 
 i removed the flagicons based on the talk page consensus only to have trocksukN revert me without an edit summary 
 i think its time to block his account just until he engages in discussion when hes blocked he will have to use his talk page 
 hi gtbacchus i just wanted to thank you for closing the move request vote or discussion re medical cannabis i have seen your contributions to the encyclopedia many times previously and have admired your work but havent had direct occasion to express my appreciation before im glad to have such an opportunity now so once again thanks and nbspuN and nbsp 
 cheers thanks for the shout out i have been inactive for a little while so i was a little concerned that wikipedias changed but we seem to be just as shipshape as ever see you around 
 not making a big deal about it but the requester is generally considered as a support unless they say otherwise so it was N not N 
 you are right there were three supporting i have made an edit that reflects that ultimately its not the numbers that matter but the reasons given 
 thats fair enough 
 excellent thank you 
 hi there i am requesting for rollback rights because i think i wouldnt have an issue with looking over edits people made to articles i already know wikipedias 
 deskana is active so you should first approach him on 
 i have just posted a followup on 
 thanks for the headsup 
 i wish you a nice day 
 thanks for the headsup i will reply to you there by the way thats a neat thingy that secure link where can i learn more about that 
 i could have sworn there used to be a policy that nonfree images couldnt have a resolution of more than N px on either dimension but i will be damned if i can find it now i have asked 
 s melesses response 
 hi gtbacchus i know you can fix things like this one so here it goes user 
 hi i believe i have fixed everything so the history of the article is located at the same title as the article itself if you notice anything i missed please let me know cheers 
 thank you 
 hi gt check your email thanks and nbspuN and nbsp 
 yeah did you get my reply 
 fyi turning blue link into a red link is not fixing anything if the blue link is wrong first create a new blue link that is right and link to that rather than to a red link or just leave it alone 
 ips cannot create pages on english wikipedia 
 hmmmm 
 several of us have been making that inquiry for a couple of weeks now i believe this user has an account or had an account my recommendation is that they log on with that one 
 turning a blue link into a red one is completely acceptable dont listen to anyone who tells you that it isnt 
 pardon before i make any comment i will ask please explain 
 what im saying is that red links arent bad an example suppose theres a genus of butterflies called paris if someone links that it will be a blue link pointing to the city someone else notices that the link is wrong and changes the link from 
 does that help yes thanks those are the sorts of things i intended to say in response to your words turning a blue link into a red one is completely acceptable as for dont listen to anyone who tells you that it isnt well thats just bad advice listening to everyone is one of the ways to learn things even when they are things you have already made up your mind about you learn about the people who are saying them eg i have learnt that some of the things that you write do not always convey the meaning you intend also i have learnt about henceforth i will probably use it in preference to so thats helpful too thanks for your reply cheers 
 yeah thats fair it was a bit rude the way i said that i apologize i guess i feel very strongly that new users shouldnt be told about rules that arent really rules im a big fan of 
 it seems that despite first appearances we seem to agree with each other cheers 
 i was just running for adminship and apparently ass holes like mcflyN and all of his gay little sockpuppets ruined everything users like him should be permanently blocked for obviously creating ip addresses for vandalism disruption of an rfa and everything else hes done all he did was influence the voters at my rfa to use thier votes against me well guess what it worked good job mcflyN rockN sigmaN svenN N bensonN if you havent already figured it out are the same person that incredibly influenced freestylefrappe howcheng wile e heresiarch and olorinN to voting oppose well if you all are that stupid enough to listen to a vandal thats your problems now i got some anon ip address on my rfa saying im not good enough well screw you all 
 thank you for informing me about that is no way for an admin to act i will cross out my support vote and now vote oppose next time i see myself asking the question how can this person not already be an admin i will check to see why keep up the good work and have a nice day 
 thanks for helping me get set up on wikipedia i always loved wikipedia and i didnt know i could edit it i thought you had to be a super genius or something but thanks for showing me that you dont have to be 
 d being a super genius is kind of overrated anyway

 hi gt your name is being invoked at the ani so best you weigh in check the links but review the diffs presented in their entirety in full context i was just trying to see if other people had an experience similar to mine and i found someone apparently my comment there to that user was ani worthy 
 thanks for the headsup both of you i have commented there 
 hey twsx before i say this let me just note that i really do not wish to start an edit war against you as i think you are a good editor still just to clear up the amon amarth thing it wasnt a lie about the line breaks being part of the mos as can be seen in one of the two examples 
 i am aware nevertheless that part of the comment was very missleading giving unaware editors a falsified impression of the policy also the comment was warning users to not do something which is clearly also in support of policy which would be the reason why i have removed the comment fully though as i am sure you have noticed i did not and will not touch the formatting of the genre field so i think this should not be reason for any grudge between us even if you consider have considered the possibility of me being a sock puppeteer ~ and nbsp or and nbsp 
 ah i knew adding your name to that list would give the wrong impression i never really thought you would be a puppeteer as i said to libs i think you are far more mature than that as i know you have passed the edit war already i simply put your name there as this is really where most of the edit warring began but i felt a bit bad having your name there as it really did seem to give the wrong impression and so i have removed it sorry for bad faith i may have shown uN 
 oh dont worry i was only poking ~ and nbsp or and nbsp 
 well thats alright but i still just want to it clear that i wasnt accusing you of sock puppetry or anything ^_~ uN 
 hi now that 
 yeah i can help with that though im not likely to do them all in one sitting 
 thanks 
 yeah for some reason i like doing these manually i can do them pretty quickly the count is about N last i checked also needing to be done i noticed theres a page 
 thank you for your changes to 
 i wasnt aware that minor changes required an edit summary but i will include edit summaries on all changes from now on 
 thanks as you will certainly notice there are some good wikipedians who dont bother to put an edit summary even if it is required so ultimately you will develop your own style too 
 do you know if i can make a page like a talk page explaining to wiki about myself like you did omg im sure you know do you have a link to the part in the guide thanks if you can 
 glad you got that sorted out 
 in future when patrolling new pages could you click the little link at the bottom right of the page and mark it as patrolled that way it removes it from specialnewpages and other patrollers dont need to trawl through pages that have already been checked 
 this is a mod that twinkle requires or i assume it is in fact it usually says that it has marked it as patrolled but it also seems not always to be consistent perhaps you would like since you seem to know more about the patrolled status than i do to take this up with the guy who created twinkle i see no issue with asking but i have less presumably experience than you 
 hi there id also love to see stats on diacriticallybased moves if there are trends if it makes a difference whether its a persons name or a place that sort of thing and also on how the current titles got that way how many were born with diacritics how many were moved there later on and viceversa any ideas on how to assemble those kind of stats id help 
 i once made a list 
 undoubtedly im probably done with wp for the day but you or i should bring this up over there 
 hi gtbacchus this is just to say thank you for closing the move at 
 thank you if you are in one of the few time zones where its still christmas then merry christmas to you too else uh happy 
 sure i mean i guess you already have contacted me you are welcome to send me an email just use the link on the left side of the screen im interested to see which article you are talking about 
 by the way you dont need registered user rights to contribute to most articles have you tried editing it yourself 
 thanks for the move happy holidays 
 you are welcome and happy days to you too 
 thanks for your comments on it in total agreement i have seen time and time again editors say schools are inherently notable in afd discussions without providing any reliable evidence of the notability of the school in question of some some schools are notable but others only deserve a one line mention in a city or suburb article id also be interested in your thoughts on year N high achievers that is creeping into the article 
 if its the same area im thinking of its fairly culturally diverse and if i had more time to look into it id be hitting the social sciences journals to see if any research had been conducted from its student population the setting up of the school changes over time and things like any books about education in western sydney government gazettes and the like would be useful year N s sadly are rarely notable for any reason and in a school article context have a very transient notability its one thing to have like ian thorpe or kim beazley go to the school its quite another to have a firstamongequals situation where the persons only really known for what they did at or for the school and forgotten and replaced when they move on 
 in case you didnt notice there arent any secondary sources in the couch gag article either 
 true there arent any secondary sources in the couch gag article the sources do exist however they just havent been added to the article see 
 or thank you very much for working with me in N to make the encyclopedia a better place regardless of any disagreements we may have had i want to wish you all the very best for N i look forward to working with you and i hope for health and happiness to you and your family in the year to come i therefore send you this 
 thank you so much i wish you all the things you wish for yourself in the coming year and look forward to seeing you around cheers 
 why was 
 im sorry i misread the discussion i will put it back 
 thanks no worries tbh i should have requested the discussion be closed a while ago but i forgot about it 
 if anyone wants to do anything about malleus that will be meaningful and not just pissing into the wind then they will have to start with an rfc or u 
 my point is precisely what i said im not sure i understand your question im not saying whether someone should or should not start an rfc or u just pointing out that anything short of it is fatuous 
 my question is rooted in the knowledge that there are many editors here some of them admins who would like nothing better than to see me gone i just wondered if you were one of them 
 there are many things id like better than to see you gone id like to see you contributing to wikipedia in your usual highquality manner and id like to see you involved in less heat and static id like to see you not show up in wqa threads that are easily avoidable i certainly recall seeing you choose to say or do things that would obviously and inevitably lead to heat and static and then when shit happened you played dumb about it you are not naxefve and you cant fool me into thinking that you are so yeah id like to see less of that kind of nonsense id like to see your good work continue and your unnecessarily provocative bullshit end thats a pretty reasonable desire isnt it 
 just as i thought i doubt you and i will ever agree about anything bring on your rfc or u 
 we agreed on something just about an hour ago in your own words and i suspect you and i would agree about most editing matters the only points where we disagree involve how to treat other people and the usefulness of stirring up shit you seem to think that you can yell at people and have some positive effect in the world by doing it and i know that to be false you once tried to set my hat on straight by talking to me like i was dirt that was neither smart nor useful nor effective i mean unless you think that venting your feelings is a valid use of wikipedias servers its not thats all though we probably agree about most other things i will never open an rfc or u on you or anyone else and i have no desire to do so if you think otherwise its because you foolishly believe you know things that you just dont know you are dishonest and emotionally a child now leave my talk page 
 you do realise thats a personal attack gtb and unless you do something about it i will report it to one of the admin boards 
 gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble 
 i wish you would both knock it off there before it gets nasty seeing this on my watchlist is distracting me from enjoying my last day of winter break you are both good people with good intentions and i wish you would both just walk away from this now please 
 john i appreciate and respect your point however i feel that given his history asking for people to just make nice and move along is equivalent to asking that malleus continue to get a free pass for chronic asshattery he abuses more editors per week than i have in N years he mocks anyone who reports him for incivility and then turns around and reports me because i actually hit a sensitive spot which he finds in others for sport thats capitalh hypocrisy the only personal attack in there is that i called him dishonest and emotionally a child which i stand by and he has now in the an or i thread called me a child twice and dishonest once i dont support a block of him though i support someone getting through his skull that hes wrong chronically this is not a symmetric situation this is malleus taking his seat as the godking of trolls im not the easiest to bait but he did it artfully and i think you will see that if you take a broad view of the situation im happy that i realized what was going on when i did and im happy that his colors are showing now for so many to see hes been getting a free pass for way too long and he will never change as long as people say now now you both have good intentions if you care about the people he drives away from the project then i dont see how you can hold us up as equal in any way here whom have i driven away from wikipedia with my chronic incivility if i only light into an average of N person every N months then it might really be about that person and not about my anger issues am i making sense here 
 no 
 no just trying reading what you just wrote as if you were someone else without all of your baggage 
 gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble 
 too little too late 
 hello this message is being sent to inform you that there currently is a discussion at 
 thanks john i was just about to add that myself 
 i have blocked you for N hours for the diff at ani and your comment preceding it admin or not theres no need for attacks like that im sure there will be a review at ani but youre welcome to appeal with with regret 
 thank you for the note i have no plan to request an unblock i think we have quite neatly shown that malleus brand of behavior is extremely unhelpful by showing just where it leads i couldnt be happier 
 i have never been blocked before so this is what its like good work malleus you have proved my point telling someone off is unhelpful and leads to inevitable drama thats all i had to say 
 so you consider yourself a martyr eh sacrificing yourself for the good of the community to bring alleged hypocrisy to light 
 no because i havent sacrificed anything 
 wow you sound really supercilious both here and in the sections below 
 thank you for your input 
 just because an application runs as a web service doesnt mean its any less an application please post to the discussion pages before making large sweeping changes based on your own personal criteria 
 fyi i have not edited that page at all during this time like i posted elsewhere the last thing i want to do is be expected to clean that page up i posted my N cents have been waiting for you to explain where it says a web application is any less an application 
 if im treated differently from you its not because im an admin its because i havent got a pattern of behaving this way and you do remember fuck off troll by acting the way you act i stirred up shit and got blocked duh 
 my money is precisely where my mouth is and i notice you continue to engage in the behavior that you decry in others my point is neatly made and the muds on your face i couldnt be happier 
 still doing it report me for calling you a child and then repeatedly call me a child this is awesome i couldnt have written it better are people taking notes 
 ciao carlos excuse me if this isnt the proper way to contact youbut i did a good amount of research on how to deal with deleted articles and i am a bit lost in the woods as i understand it i am supposed to contact you as an admin who can help with the restoring of the article im an inexperienced user but i joined wikipedia to help translate english articles into italian one problem i have run into is entry of the band ra ra riot it currently exists in italian but was deleted in english several times even while the band continues to recieve coverage for its music and tours i worked with the band recentlybefore the death of their drummer they were featured in rolling stone magazine and are by all means notable a quote from the spin magazine article i posted in a later version of the entry said you must know syracuses ra ra riot like right now they are a signed working musical group with one ep released commercially on the rebel group label a fulllength album due two european tours and several north american tours completed again i apologize if i am going about this process incorrectly thanks very much if you are able to help cheers 
 grazie tante i have updated the page to include all new references and conform to those notability standards it is located 
 sorry about the use of the word european thats my fault i didnt mean to imply that if the band toured the uk theyd been to mainland europe as a whole yet in any case i have fixed that and added a second reference to show the N shows they played on their second trip over so i have updated the page now to hopefully move it past where it appeared to rest on the borderline 
 im an admin open to recall all you have to do is get a handful of editors in good standing who agree that i should relinquish the mop and i will i am totally at service to the desires of this community desysop me if you mean what you say else its wind 
 you are not even being accurate man thats not when you withdrew you withdrew after the scene where you ran to an or i to ask whether it was ok for me to maybe edit dramatica and then i made it abundantly clear that you had fucked up you withdrew quite appropriately in shame after that july is later than april convenient memory of yours 
 a few things not being arsed to spell my name correctly is a bit of a puzzle in a post that asks us to treat each other with respect if nothing else use copy or paste what he doesnt know is that N per cent of my contributions here are devoted to singing precisely the song that hes singing now only in the case of the very worst and most malicious editors do i even come close to flying off the handle i have had four incidents in N years compared to malleus record of shitting on more people than that every single week he drives people away from the project and i get people thanking me for teaching them to be less combative and more collegial my record is easy to review and im open to recall rfc or u me if you think i have got anger issues i have got issues with the way our community tolerates chronically malicious and trolling presences such as malleus and bugs retros mindreading is also off he says that i gobbled totally ignorant of the fact that he probably insulted malleus how insulting can you be i knew damn well that id insulted him quite intentionally thus giving him the response to baiting that he sought in the moment that i did it i let him troll me unintentionally just as soon as i did it though i realized that i had let him troll me and that it was going to play out in a way that i find just skippy i was about to watch him become a fully completed hypocrite and the best thing i could say was gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble it really is the best response to some kinds of energy at least according to 
 i have had four incidents in N years compared to malleus record of shitting on more people than that every single week he drives people away from the project can you provide any evidence for that slander i will give you seven days to either support your assertion or to apologise for it before taking it to arbcom 
 you just said earlier today that you never demand apologies another lie please take me to arbcom i cant wait dont bother with the seven days you will get nothing from me 
 its your choice not mine i asked you to provide some evidence where is it 
 i just said you get nothing i dont lie thats your game if i said you get nothing then you get nothing your hypocrisy increases with each post do it already 
 what world are you living in you are a sysop whos been blocked for incivility yet you persist with it has the block taught you nothing 
 you are still unwilling to put your money where your mouth is do something about it or you have proven that you are nothing but a windbag your threats are empty malleus empty hows that feel btw pointing out baldfaced lies that i can easily link to is not incivility making them might be but i dont report people for incivility 
 i mean do you seriously think you can intimidate me wow man just wow 
 has the block taught you nothing you must be kidding what did you just say earlier today about the effects of blocks on yourself do you even remember and now you try to get all schoolmarm on me thats just stupefying 
 im sorry but getting the community to take a closer look at malleus behavior is not a wrongdoing i am quite happy with how this is going you dont know the context sufficiently well to make apt remarks i appreciate and respect the spirit in which you are offering conciliatory words but you dont realize just how much shit we put up with from mf many people do realize it and thats why im welcoming scrutiny if i just apologize and sweep it under a rug then im doing the community a disservice malleus is an actual problem and we have been ignoring it for too long 
 well there is nothing wrong with opening up a discussion to get consensus on the matter of malleus behavior but just remember that how mad we can be is no excuse for the sinful actions we do as a result just be calm and just give the facts sensible community members would look for the facts i would believe and contestable behavior can cause more trouble than it repairs and if malleus does happen to be committing disruptive editing then insulting him or her might only make it worse there are many many jerks in this world so do not let them get under your skin and we all make mistakes so just learn from them and move on [ and #N 
 it really doesnt help to use words like sinful when talking with people who might not share those notions we dont go to the same church okay i appreciate what you are doing but thats a good way to push peoples buttons to reply to your comments you areally arent familiar with my record if you think that what you are telling me is anything different from what i say every single day then you are wrong im a step ahead of you i was rude to malleus and that was an error thats easy for me to grant but im not going to apologize to him nor to do anything that simply encourages this being swept under the rug i believe that malleus is consistently driving people away from this project a delay in looking at his editing is not helpful if he files some kind of case against me thats the fastest way to get this problem aired before the arbitrators therefore im all for it i dont want to make nice and to pour oil on this water i want malleus to understand that hes not as completely abovetherules as he claims to be i dont claim to be above the rules he does he just did it on an or i how many times should we sweep this under the rug when it comes to responding to an rfc or u or an arbcom case i am actually very very very good at being calm and just giving the facts you are not familiar with my record i care about this project very much and im tired of seeing it shit on by a troll as insidious as malleus fatuorum he is doing the project very great harm and thats why i describe him as one of the worst and most malicious editors he doesnt get banned in a week he keeps damaging the project for years how long shall we turn a blind eye to this

 re 
 it was decided in that afd that the subject of the article was not notable enough for an article if somethings changed perhaps you should try 
 i am afraid you were not reading my request carefully from deletion review i perused i saw it is not uncommon to restore deleted articles into user space i am dissapointed with your bureaucratic attitude fortunately i have found what looks like an old fork of the wikipedia article (and 
 in the charles manson dispute you mentioned several times i got pissed and you mentioned possible anger issues earlier here today dont edit when angry is not a terrible thing to consider please let me know if i have got anything wrong here and cheers 
 maybe it is just me but i dont see how bringing up this completely unrelated incident from a year ago is helpful i can see that you are trying to draw a connection between the two but i dont think there is one 
 thats how i met gtbacchus im not trying to point out a pattern of incivility that should be sanctioned i hope he will respond this is not an indictment of him but a request for his input on my take most editors that i question either can defend themselves very well or have no defense he is of the former category im sure he will understand what im bringing up and why cheers > 
 theres some stuff to think about here one easy point when you offer to provide diffs upon request of his dishonesty and then arefuse to provide them it doesnt look good i didnt refuse to provide diffs of his dishonesty he never asked for those he asked for diffs documenting that hes driven people away those instances dont tend to have clear diffs unlike his dishonesty which is easy to document he lied N or N times during the affair yesterday and i pointed those instances out quite clearly i am still completely willing to provide further documentation of malleus dishonesty and he still hasnt asked for such nor responded to what i have already provided he wants documentation of those hes driven away and im holding out on that until he fulfills his promise your points about anger are wellmade and i will take some more time to respond to that if anyone wants further evidence of mals easytodocument dishonesty they need only ask 
 im asking 
 finally d give me few minutes to read this post below and i will trot out a list of your words and behaviors that i perceive as dishonest i pointed out some blowbyblow yesterday but i will recap 
 ok yesterdays examples are fairly trivial but their baldfaced nature makes them stick out in my mind just a couple of hours after saying at wqa i have to agree with gtbacchus you said that you doubt we will ever agree on anything thats trivial and silly but glaring and telling to my mind someone who tells trivial lies will also tell big ones saying you doubt we will agree on anything is also an absurd and grandiose claim when its trivially obvious that we agree about very very many things we both abhor abusive admins for example except that you wont believe me despite my clear record of calling them out and watching them get desysopped for precisely the behavior i called them out for what do you care about facts when you have already decided you know what i am just a couple of hours after saying i have never demanded an apology from anyone on wikipedia and i dont expect to start now you demanded an apology from me is it true that you have never done this before perhaps maybe this was an entirely new behavior out of malleus fatuorum it reeks to me of dishonest posturing followed by hypocrisy technically you dont expect to start now leaves open the possibility that you might which would make it less of an honesty issue and more of a selfknowledge one who knew that you were about to open a new door reporting others for civility violations and demanding apologies next thing you know you will have a civility police badge and you will wear it proud i guess you will never say again that you have never demanded an apology because now you have done it remember that now we get to substantial stuff given your attitude about civility police theres something fundamentally dishonest about reporting someone for a civility violation but lets not linger over that i got under your skin and you reacted as such this is normal lots of us engage in behavior that we normally decry when we are pushed to a certain point that doesnt make us phonies so much as fallible humans and if we can start from the premise that we both make mistakes in our interactions then we will get along just fine i have never seen a glimmer of that kind of humility from you does it exist i dunno heres what im really thinking about and it happened a little while ago leaving a big impression in my mind there was a wqa complaint about you and i saw the thread and commented someone had posted a civility warning to your talk page for telling another editor that he should grow up your response to the warning was fuck off troll and his response was to go to wqa i told him that leaving you civility warnings was pointless at best which i think we would agree about then you and i had a havery interesting conversation you said that a reasonable person performs whatever actions are most likely to lead to their preferred result we agree about that i pointed out that you had essentially requested the wqa report because you performed an action that was most likely to lead there namely telling someone to fuck off and calling them a troll when they have already exhibited an officious and lawyerly approach to civility this is a nobrainer tell a civilitycop to fuck off and you have just asked for escalation please you said that my logic was wrong at the following point that you really expected he would just fuck off i responded that you couldnt possibly be that naxefve and your reply was fascinating you said that youd heard enough of my psychobabble and came around to my talk page to yell at me and set my hat straight now what really happened here you knew damn well that a civility cop wont fuck off if you tell him to fuck off he will escalate this is obvious and you have more than enough experience to know it you knew damn well that he would escalate and you pushed that button quite intentionally after pushing the button you claimed that you didnt know what that button did and that you actually expected him to just toddle off into the sunset when i pointed out that you cant be that naxefve you became abusive you didnt argue that no you really thought he would leave you alone you didnt stop and think and say hmmm theres a thought i guess that is pretty predictable no you started in with the namecalling now is this a trivial untruth no its not a lie in the most literal sense of the word it is fundamental deepdowninside dishonesty its intellectual disintegrity when someone pointed out that you were wrong you didnt think about acknowledging it you just went into attack mode that is the opposite of honesty an honest man hears criticism considers it seriously and either takes it to heart or says why it doesnt apply an honest man does not respond to honest criticism by flying off the handle an honest man owns up to his mistakes its pretty clear that you enjoy a fight that you like telling people off and that you get a kick out of seeing people get upset over your blunt words do you admit to this no what do you do you say that someone needs their hat set on straight as if you are stupid enough to think that your yelling at someone will somehow improve them as a person you would have to be a great fool to think this and you are not a great fool thus dishonesty you dont yell at people to set their hats straight because you know goddamned well that it doesnt have that effect thats like saying you piss to make the sun rise you piss because you have to piss and you take the piss because you want to take the piss you see i cant believe that you are stupid you werent just born last week you know how people react to things and you know that they will react in ways that you then claim to be surprised by therefore i must believe that you are playing games with us playing games and not owning up to them is fundamentally dishonest honest men simply dont do it im not talking about trivial untruths im talking about fundamental intellectual integrity so why did i call you dishonest well partly it was to point out the nonsense in your claims from last time partly it was so you would ask me for examples and as i think of more i will add them partly largely it was because i knew it would piss you off and i am honest enough to own my motivations even when they are as shitty and stupid as they were yesterday pissing someone off is a terrible motivation anytime any place no question i fucked up so did you malleus and i wonder when you will be someone who can admit as much in public im owning up to mistakes here it was a mistake to tell you that you are dishonest and emotionally a child and it was a mistake i made because i was upset with your ridiculous writing off of my previous statements posting in anger is always a mistake and i have done it a few times im now trying to make the most of it im certainly not apologizing for it despite it being a mistake because i want you to file that case i think it will serve the community which is much more important than either of us i dont think thats a mistake we will see what have your mistakes been malleus 
 good work helping us expand on southeast asian cinema however just wanted to give you a heads up that i have deleted the winners portion of the template festival navigational templates are designed for articles on individual years and should not be used for linking to the award winners furthermore the linking to titles via the year is generally frowned upon in standard text much less in a template where the link can be easily construed to be for an article on that years award itself please let me know if you have any questions or concerns thanks 
 also when adding to the talk page please delete any unused parameters before saving your edit as they unduly enlarge the page size and can be cumbersome to trawl through for future editors 
 i feel very pleased now that i bothered at all it was kind of you to delete all of that without any discussion thank you very much 
 im sorry you feel that way but i have explained my reasoning above its always disappointing to have something that one spent time on deleted but if you want to discuss the matter with regard to reasons besides effort expended im happy to regards 
 you should never use the phrase i am sorry but because that is plain aggressively rude it means i look as if i am sorry but i am not sorry at all i find that phraseology pompous and arrogant you may wish to reconsider it i find your draconian edit without any attempt to discuss this onthe template talk page to be high handed i find your pseudoapology to be unpleasant 
 if you cant even assume the pretense of good faith i dont really think that this requires any further response 
 i was not aware that you were pretending good faith interesting 
 im guessing neither of you are very inclined to do so right now but id recommend disengaging arbcom is certainly not going to take a case about this minor imbroglio its hard to imagine an rfc or u helping anything so what should be done i have no idea so best to do nothing ie go back to whatever you were doing before its not really fair but then again what is these days both of you are longtime wikipedians so no doubt you are able to deal pretty well with completely unsatisfying resolutions to disputes and mdashbetter to come to that end sooner than later and without another thirty comments on someones talk page that you will have trouble remembering even three months from now 
 for the record pathological liars do tend to burn themselves out fairly quickly here or are found out by others i ran into this situation a few years ago and when i brought it to the attention of the community and several different administrators they chose to ignore the problem completely eventually it resolved itself but i learned my lesson dont depend on the community to take responsibility for making the right decisions as they tend to avoid it altogether the cultural demographic here is all about ignore it and hope it goes away which says a lot about the maturity level of the average editor and human nature in general 
 just so theres no misunderstanding here who are you calling a pathological liar viriditas 
 my personal remembrance and reminiscence of things past could not result in a misunderstanding since it was not intended to convey or impart any private information about current active editors 
 i would broadly agree with everything you have said here as for disengaging im disengaged with malleus except for answering his request for documentation above the ball is in his court and he will either file the case he said he would or he wont if he files a case i will respond if not oh well the only thing that an rfc or u will accomplish is to document problems for a future arbcom case thats all that rfc or us are good for mostly i have never been party to malleus receiving unfair blocks and if he wants to take them out on me oh well i truly hope that he brings an rfc against me i want the vindication one other thing and you are welcome to test me on this if someone says i lied or calls me dishonest my havery first reaction will be to ask for documentation thats before i fly off the handle if it turns out i spoke an untruth they will have an apology before they have time to ask for one i take honestly extremely seriously if im going to stop being honest then i hope also to stop breathing in that moment if someone claims to have caught me being dishonest my thoughts are about identifying and fixing that problem not about hitting that person im not playing around here 
 in particular i have warned malleus about repeated posting to your talk page further thereto please either take great care in the wording of your posts here so that mf doesnt feel compelled to respond in a matching derogatory vein or grant your explicit permission for mf to comment here in whatever manner they see fit your choice 
 you warned him what effect will that have same as other warnings hes received malleus may reply here in whatever manner he sees fit and then we can all see what he means by fit i have a hard time seeing please dont have a confrontation as anything other than let him be as abusive as he wants to be anytime he wants to do it nobody has suggested any way of mitigating his behavior other than to let him be thats been failing for years 
 well you do your admin actions and i will do mine i dont issue warnings lightly if you are opening up this page to malleus by explicit invitation i for one will consider it a noblock zone but really gtbacchus you are better than this and i think you could really use a day off a way to mitigate his behaviour fergawdssake just freakin ignore it would be a possibility if everyone did that it wouldnt be a big issue but theres always someone who will take the bait so whose fault is it then the good fisherman or the silly fish this will not get resolved and discussing who is the bigger liar just goes nowhere at all that i can see 
 im pretty sure that baiting is a behavior we frown upon until we can change human nature so that nobody takes bait then having people around baiting for sport is a problem if i ignore it as i have for years then fish after fish after fish gets shit on regarding discussing who is the bigger liar if someone has made postings about my honesty i havent read them yet when i do i will own up to any failing on my part because i have no wish to be dishonest or misleading in any way shape or form it is my extremely honest opinion that if someone sees fit to use our servers to bait insult abuse mock and poke at others then they should be stopped i dont do these things and the only time i get really upset is when i see someone else getting away with treating their fellow wikipedians like dirt i wont look away from active abuse and im sorry if anyone else thinks that looking away is a solution im sorry if anyone thinks that blaming people for not being thick skinned enough is a solution im sorry if anyone thinks that we should expect editors here to tolerate contempt and derision as being par for the course we should be better than that and im very sorry if we are not 
 now that i have had time to catch up i see that discussing who is the bigger liar is a completely misleading red herring nobody has even accused me of dishonesty so that is sure as hell not what any discussion is about malleus asked for documentation of why i called him dishonest i provided it and thats that looking the other way is no solution and im disappointed 
 the bigger liar was not intended as a red herring at all but i believe you are correct that your own honesty has not been questioned here rather i was referring to a mfs record of calling others liars which yes i do believe i can thoroughly documemt as needed and b my perception of continued dares and provocations to each other you seem clearly to wish a confrontation here to setlle this once and for all but i rather doubt you will gain much traction heading up this particular road anyway noone has questioned your honesty looking the other way we all do that occasionally the question is is this the issue you want to hang your hat on if so then file your own rfc or u or rfar or at the least calm down and put what you are saying into reasonable terms of tried and failed to resolve the dispute so that others can judge beyond your evident frustration with the current situation 
 i might be significantly calmer and less frustrated than you think its getting to be days between posts how much emotion do you imagine im dragging around new orleans with me there are bigger and better fish to fry around here than anything on this wiki at least for my money also i process things without doing all my thinking aloud on this page i feel pretty good about the way this situation is currently disposed either mf will do what he said hed do and that makes me happy or he wont do what he said hed do and that makes me happy i do feel passionately that wikipedia suffers when we allow chronically abusive users to get away with it and i think that mf is chronically abusive but i dont have to file any action against him someone else will do it and eventually he will either moderate his behavior or he will have to go its just life on wikipedia have a beer its a beautiful world 
 calling me chronically abusive is a clear personal attack one that might earn a nonadministrator a warning at the very least id suggest that you consider the wisdom of perhaps engaging your brain before posting again 
 im describing a behavior which is not inappropriate to do your behavior is problematic and its fine for me to notice that if you disagree we can talk about your behavior but crying no npa in the same breath as telling me to engage my brain is not going to get you very far or make you look very sympathetic if you feel that someone has been rude to you then being rude back is not a very good strategy try the high road i have never suggested that your brain is less than engaged simply that you are doing something disruptive and doing it regularly i dont suppose you mean to be disruptive so it would be good for you to learn better interaction skills now you work on that and i will work on doing what i do dont worry i wont file a case against you and you know that because i said i wouldnt you were quite clear that you absolutely would file one against me and i look forward to that meanwhile dont act like a civility cop crying npa when someone suggests that your actions may be problematic im describing your actions just as dispassionately as arbcom will eventually have to describe them before you reply think whats your goal and what is most likely to lead there in this universe will berating me get you where you want to be 
 im describing your actions just as dispassionately as arbcom will eventually have to describe them please dont waste any more of your time trying to threaten me it never works never 
 ok thanks its not a threat but a prediction because i absolutely wont be the one doing it i said i wouldnt file any kind of case so i wont someone will its inevitable i hope you do what you said youd do have a nice day and i will keep my counsel on how i spend my time 
 i suppose viriditas was dead on ericlebN ( 
 hes a jerk but he does good work is not a good way to deal with problems anyone who seriously considers ignore it to be a useful solution to a problem like this should stick to article writing and leave disputes to others 
 did you hear anything from these people 
 nothing yet who knows 
 its true you get nout for out in this world was worth a chance anyway any word from liz how is she keeping 
 havent heard from her we should both write to her 
 if you are free during the week i could really do with some help 
 i will check it out 
 with reference to your edit concerning duns on the atlantic roundhouse page i was referring specifically to the kind of dun thats extremely common in for example the isle of lewis often occupying small loch islets when referenced as in this case as a particular kind of construction the term could probably use some disambiguation from the generic term used to describe pretty much any sort of fort 
 good stuff theres plenty to do about scottish archaeology the dun article needs a bit of clarification since there are probably more rectangular duns than round ones and further information like the above could help that article i think its probably best to explain the variations on that article and not disambiguate into sub articles unless it gets really big 
 i tend to only use the term dun when talking about the brochlike constructions the rectangular ones and suchlike i usually refer to as forts maybe a description of the topoynm dxfan would be a good way to distinguish between the roundhouse and nonroundhouse duns of course that toponym is also used to describe brochs and related structures its a confusing mess really believe it or not the atlantic roundhouse terminology has been introduced to simplify these matters and to reduce the tendancy to classify these structures into ridgid groups it does work but its going to take time to come into common useage most widely held knowledge about broch related matters is at least N years out of date most importantly though have a cool jul 
 thank you for you comments in closing the dee doocey move request how would you propose going resolving this issues you viewed it has purly descended into name calling could please try and untangle some of the mess which is being creaated by entrenched interests on both sides of this issue many thanks 
 it is a bit messy isnt it thats inevitable but it can be minimized if everyone agrees as to whats actually going on the whole 
 i know you said you would not argue against a reversal of your original closure but i presume you were talking about a legitimate reversal made by at least a knowledgeable editor in good standing if not an admin thats not what happened see 
 thanks for the note 
 i cant believe no one is unclosing the discussion and reverting the move are they really going to take advantage of a situation created by an apparent vandal because it happens to coincide with their pov i assumed at least one admin could be more objective than that 
 its happened now although its beginning to look like we will be back at 
 well i agree that consensus has not come along far enough yet to clearly support the shorter name but it has come along far enough to also not clearly support the longer name the way this is handled in other countries like australia is some cities are slowing being moved i thought we were there with ann arbor i still think we might be i really want an experienced and knowledgeable uninvolved admin to give the arguments careful consideration and close accordingly perhaps someone who used to close a lot of requests but is now semiretired or moved on to other tasks someone like that 
 i agree that would be ideal maybe a note at 
 if theres insufficient support for the new short name then it should go back to the old longer name thats consistent with the naming convention and nbsp 
 its not clear how well supported that naming convention is but it appears that the discussion is going to favor what you are saying at least for now 
 i was going to give you yet another copyeditor barstar but this seems better somehow 
 thank you so very much and mdash 
 will take upeace 
 somewhat removing warnings and such is frowned upon although you are welcome to 
 first of all i suggest you keep

 hello mathwizN thank you for contributing the public domain usgs photographs to various articles how do you obtain these photographs id like to help out this way as well 
 the website itself is copyright microsoft but it says on the website image courtesy of the us geological survey meaning that the images are public domain i got the idea from another article if you look at frosts or woottons table code it says that it is adapted form another high schools site if you go there they also have an aerial so i took the idea from them just remember to put the template on them or else they will be deleted 
 your new sig looks great the icon is reminiscent of the windows xp search wizard is that considered to be fair use i am considering building a schoolwatch list of articles which could benefit from some minor upgrades and attention would you be interested in such a focused list and be willing to help contribute by doing things such as dropping in an aerial photograph or table 
 yes id contribute
 glad to hear it some schools which could benefit right away would include 
 new signature without microsoft and copy image better
 looks great in other news the schoolwatch page is underway 
 let me test my new signature
 testing newer signature
 and newer 
 this time i added big and small text all caps plus i finally discovered that selecting the raw signature checkbox made it so i didnt have to begin and end with and nbsp and mdash and nbsp

 you are welcome 
 could you indicate at 
 if you were not aware the united states geological survey agency takes photographs in both color and black and white based upon my own experience most of the older images or images taken in the midwestern united states are black and white but there are exceptions your results will vary from place to place 
 the image you linked to is from N looking at the description i wrote on the images page it was taken in N you were looking at the older black and white version while i uploaded the color one
 but where did you get the color photo from could you give me a url please id like to be able to get similar aerial photos for other locations thanks 
 go to and on the left type in N scott drive rockville maryland the address of

 if you have any questions about the permission dont hesitate to ask otherwise happy editing 
 i emphatically disagree about the 
 it is a couple ramps off of ny N to the parallel montauk highway and as such its known for being an obstruction at best and a hazard at worst which is what makes it deserving of an article it was built in this manner as a substitute for a areal interchange whereas if it were just that it wouldnt be worthy of one as far as me showing you an sps sfw that sps still has the the info and history behind it and even if the website didnt exist the interchange would still be notable for the reasons mentioned above 
 i dont think the chapter needs to be split as much as it needs to be trimmed id do it now but my pc is hindering my ability to cut and paste again so i will have to wait until another time 
 are you sure 
 if people want to know why things along route N are the way they are they are going to have to know about the former and proposed interchanges 
 thats a great idea they should be mentioned my only concern is that separate articles about former or proposed interchanges on any state highway wont be able stand up to 
 i suppose that means youd merge every interchange mentioned in 
 i would say its more of the reason why there are zero articles about interchanges in iowa than anything else i myself will not be merging any of the interchanges in the category any time soon but there are a couple in there of which i question their notability the best option would be for the project to come up with a scope for interchanges and then work from there and ndash 
 it sure would have been nice for you to how many pages currently used the 
 just to expand upon on what drwN said we differ in that i do support the useage of templates but must agree with him that sweeping changes cannot be made to school templates that may affect non us schools it may be best to create an explicitly uscentric template and a global template for schools which can be used as a model for future regional school templates please bear this in mind when making revisions to templates down the road your actions may be wide reaching in closing i would like to add that you have been doing a great job improving the school articles and thank you for your contributions 
 sorry that my comment sounds a bit harsh i was just quite irritated at the fact that my school page had been made somewhat unreadable and yes i know its not mine and wikipedia is a community thing just to clarify my personal position i think a tables good maybe not quite as detailed as the present one but i feel that its much better to have article text written by a person rather than a template because i feel that would better represent the variety of schools griders separate us and nonus templates sound good to me sorry for sounding so hostile i dont hate you or anything 
 i have placed 
 and 
 i suspect 
 theres still one question you didnt answer though doug how is the oakdale merge like any other interchange on a suburban highway because i have both seen and been on enough of them to know otherwise 
 keep in mind im not arguing for restoration of it as a separate article 
 fair enough and for the record while im satisfied with redirecting this to sunrise highway i have to ask does the interchange you showed me have a unique name 
 you created this currently empty category im trying to find out what you intended to use it for if you are not using it would you mind listing it for deletion to keep thing neat thanks for your work on the pedia 
 i created a 
 thanks for your answer i have added some more text to the category to help clarify its purpose for other confused people like me thanks for your work on the pedia 
 thank you for clarifying the page and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 please revert your changes related to us route N e us route N splits into N e and N w through two states and then rejoins however N e is the main throughway the exit to N w is barely noticeable therefore the complete end to end journey on us route N requires travel on N e if you remove N e N would then need to be split into north and south parts which would totally confuse people all the maps and distances in all the articles have been setup with the N or N e usage any change would be a massive undertaking and result in reader confusion uN 
 do you have a source that us N e is considered the mainline of us N from what i know suffixed routes are equal splits in a us highway for other suffxied routes such as 
 by the way churchill was in fact opened in N i originally stated this from memory but theres a source you can add it to the article if you really think its necessary to cite thanks again 
 thanks you didnt mangle with the template im just somewhat of a perfectionist and love consistency 
 sure thing about the images i was asking if it was fair use to take those photographs straight from the mcps schools website the pages are marked all rights reserved so im pretty sure explicit permission would be necessary in any case i emailed the webmasters and my old apcs teacher encouraging them to take over the article and of course giving a dogmatic lecture on the importance of wikipedia in general so they release them into public domain themselves 
 after the aerial photo revolution as i like to call it wikipedia even added a licensing category on image pages for usgs aerial and you can definitle use those as for the other images lets just say i have had some trouble myself with the pictures im not sure as to whether or not it is fair use and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 it seems checkuser is in need in this situation 
 doesnt look like it to me besides we dont normally link ips to accounts anyway 
 you run the vjjar file good luck 
 thanks and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 you added the extremely generic usstub to this article in the future please consider using a more specific and helpful stub such as northcarolinageostub you can find all of them at

 why did you remove these sections please

 thanks i just got annoyed with the amount of vandalism on wikipedia i love to use wikipedia as a reference but sometimes cant put up the vandalism i heard that wikipedia might institute a stable article feature in which you can request to see the last stable version of an article and admins will be able to choose which versions are stable that should help in that the regular stable articles wont be vandalized thank you too for your help on the pedia and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 ah yes you might want to check out 
 thanks and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 i saw that you changed 
 i see what you are saying but that kinda violates both 
 hey thanks for the wiki
 thanks for the cvu site i think i will join i already use cryptoderks vandalfighter but i will see what else i can do and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 hi this is a common problem and is covered in full at

 thanks so much arctic night 
 sorry to bug you but i would like to know how to move an article out of my sandbox and into the stream for approval 
 if you need anything else or need any more information about this process then dont hesitate to contact me again 
 the only thing is phlegm what makes you consider a reliable or authorative source 
 the two govt sources also say there are N villages but doesnt name them tcsc lists N the cell tower map shows exactly those names its a preponderance of evidence thing 
 they are government sources both of which confirm this ok thats enough for me to go on 
 i put a notice template on the ones i think are wrong perhaps that would be the simplest solution it makes wikipedia look smarter than fallingrain and allows time to find out what happened to the village 
 i wanted to move 
 hi and thanks for your message i can see that 
 if you have any questions about the permission dont hesitate to ask otherwise happy editing 
 i have been in your footsteps watching is he perhaps the running for city council in petaluma ca and if so wouldnt his edits be mostly coi his one edit on 
 the page he created for himself is up for deletion because it doesnt have any content and even if he does add more content i doubt hes notable enough in order for it to stay election candidates for city council do not meet the notability criteria unless there are other factors to take into consideration and his edits to the petaluma article were reverted because he is clearly writing about himself im watching these edits and you can too unless he posts any dramatically improved content its fair to remove it fairly quickly 
 i admit im being somewhat amused by his attempts to get rid of the tag still isnt it 
 indeed it is 
 by the way offtopic two of your links aboveuN contributions and email meuN are linked up to thought you should know uN keruN bN unouN cN copiauN cN

 hey i would really appreciate it if in the future you at least do not erase other users messages on article talk pages perhaps you do not think that the citation i provided is enough to prove that it is a mr eko episode but the least you could have done is been courteous and now erased my discussion addition i am an active wikipedian and know the policies here and it is uncouth to erase critical messages that i add to discussion pages 
 i did not erase any of your comments however in i moved your comments to a new section the reason for this is because the section in which you commented future episode information had changed from being a discussion over whether or not the episode title N rd psalm was verifiable to over whether future episode information should be included at all in also became a discussion of how to stop vandals therefore i decided that it would be best to move your comments to a new section titled N rd psalm because the previous section was too large and i thought that this discussion would take up a considerable amount of room and consequently should be in a new section i do not see anything against this behavior on 
 also if you accept please indicate so on the page above and then add it to the

 hi azatoth unfortunately im at work right now and cannot access irc i can try to get on at N utc or maybe a little before and alternative is N to N utc if that doesnt work post here and i will periodically check and respond 
 fancy a challenge an editor has put a the introduction of this article is too short tag on 
 thats excellent stuff very impressive i knew we could rely on you thanks 
 hi thanks for the regex for the bad links project however it doesnt appear to catch the http links i copied it straight and put it into awb and it doesnt appear to work see here 
 i wrote the regexs with the intent of having them implemented directly into the awbs code if put in the code the extra escapes the following ones hence it will work embedded in the awbs code but not in the find and replace plus in the code it can be two regexs i will try the link you gave me with the regexs in awbs code and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 oh i see thanks for the quick response 
 i tested the program and it does fix the towanda link i will implement the fix as soon as bluemoose emails me the lastest source code and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 it works and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 no problem when you have a moment please do refer to the notability guidelines that i left a link for on your user talk page in case you cant find them here they are again 
 puN uN uN uN fmxeN uN 
 the page wasnt deleted because the team doesnt exist because quite clearly they do otherwise you wouldnt be writing about them would you however all subjects on wikipedia have to satisfy our stringent 
 sorry had forgotten to add my name 
 sorry pl alvarez but i do not know how to find out in little time if a player is notable or not so i just add the players that have a page as notable and you have to add the rest of the work i have not already done 
 i have another question up to which date have you updated the statistical things thanks for your answer 
 sorry to disturb you once more but did i make a mistake in my additions to the futures because you have deleted many of my additionsthanks for your answer 
 email me the source code for the newest version and i can implement all the changes i made these include typo fixes added bad link repair sorting headings at the end of articles and a new user detect script i can then zip the source code and send it back to you to compile and put online and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 hi i checked over your additions thanks all good except that the external links fixer regex appears to remove pipes from normal wiki links sometimes try it on 
 looking at the bush article your metadata script duplicates the persondata ie it appears twice check to make sure the replace metadata with works as for removing the pipe i cant figure that out its only supposed to remove the pipe if the link begins with http or or finally i dont think the subheadings will be a problem who puts a subheading under external links anyways is was trying a script that replaced all double equals with and temp that is find and replace with $N and temp$N then sort the headings chopping at and temp and then replace and temp with but it wouldnt work and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 an idea in private void start after checking the wikistatus add a script that navigates one of the browser to an arbitrary page eg the main page and searches the html code for you have if it finds this an alert pops up asking you to read your messages before continuing and then navigates the main browser to your user talk page this way if someone leaves a comment eg to say that one of the fixes you are applying should be stopped the awb doesnt let you fix anything until you read that comment and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 i used to have something that detected if the user had new messages but i removed it for some reason but actually i think you are right i will add it back now thanks 
 okay the alert would work too after all when a long article is a stub you only have an alert no action speaking of which you might want to make the awb remove all stub tags in that instace for example replace with and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 ok thats good but one problem it must ignore stub templates of the form and 
 it would see if there is a stub template then make sure it isnt sectstub and then make sure it isnt a tl and then replace with nothing the only problem is im not sure if one can use the $N token from the previous statement in the next that is the $N in the if statement is supposed to be the text in parenthesis before the word stub but im not sure if it would work and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 for N why does it say only internal did you remove external link fixing what regexs did you improve and it says new messages cause it to check you are still an enabled user i thought it checks you are enabled every edit and shouldnt it say stops you from editing until you check your messages not see if you are enabled i understand you might to check in case you remove someone from the list and send them a message but i think not editing at all would be better and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 please post here again if you need anymore help good luck uN 
 hey letxbN s just wait until the draws are made before creating the singles and doubles article 
 same for atp or wta why canxbN t you wait 
 in my opinion the article shouldu be made as soon as the seeds are announced or chosen 
 but they are or were not 
 the regex to fix external links was removing some pipes so i havent enabled it yet i cleaned up the large set of regexes i had done before now much more efficient it doesnt check you are enabled every edit to do so would use up a lot of bandwidth when you get a message it resets the wikistatus bool to false meaning you cant edit anymore if your name has been removed from the user list 
 check it on 
 this should help with stub removal and nbsp and mdash and nbsp 
 has this editor made substantial improvements to any article i have seen no evidence that this situation is a good place to invest our scarce mentorship resources 
 im not sure why you are asking me this im not advocating for him 
 hi diff demonstrates a problem that can be caused be the regex articletext regexreplace as you can see it removes a bracket when it shouldnt can you see how this could be fixed thanks 
 i also noticed that the uneven bracket fixer accidentally fixes external links of the form 
 thanks great job once again 
 once again as i said above do not remove the content from the lead its needed to provide context to the average reader who might stumble upon the article just because its a tennis draw does not mean its excluded from 
 once again id like to remind you regarding the draws of 
 almost anything you can do can be undone but please take a look at 
 congratulations and mdash
 congratulationsand good luck 
 congrats 
 congratulations on your new position 
 users may edit the article during the discussion including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion however do not remove the articlefordeletion template from the top of the article 
 i couldnt help but laugh even though it was kept 
 if you have any questions please let me know or post on the 
 before you carry on let me just point out 
 this is an encyclopedia not a fan site there is a disclaimer at the bottom of every page not to mention the fact that wikipedia is not censored for anyone again this is not pornography as it is not sexual in any way this has been discussed many times in the past and so the picture will not be removed if you continue to remove the picture you will be blocked for vandalism also please do not bring the subject of law into the discussion as per 
 i always see these long minuses when i look at the final results of a tournament could you please tell me if it is no problem for you how to write these long minuses because as you see it when i am editing a final result of a tournament i only know how to create the small ones thanks in advance catgamer 
 i believe you are talking about en dashes versus em dashes there are several alt codes available but your best bet is to just type it normally and wait for one of the numerous bots or scripts to fix them if need be 
 glad to support congrats 
 congrats mathwiz 
 hey if he isnxbN t notable you should afd the article 
 done 
 take care 
 this feature was added last weekend versions N and up now include bad link repair including fixing uneven bracketing replacing pipes with spaces in external links etc all you have to do is check the general fixes box on the awb if the feature doesnt seem to be working or if you want a more detailed explanation of everything that it does just ask me
 didnt realize youd just added it thanks i look forward to using it when the next round of bad link repair starts and if i have any more regegs for you i will let you know thanks again 
 gday i just wanted to ask if you could append your signature to the turnip trophy that you 
 of course my friend anything for small waterborne bird love 
 i am looking for an easier way to parse and separate red and blue links at the 
 i will work on a script i just need to know what format you want it to be do you want an addition to monobookjs and external webpage that you visit or a c# program the latter will take the most time as im new to c# but in my opinion will be the best option
 it looks like someone but i still am not sure how to actually run the thing so any more comments would be really appreciated 
 sorry but im not familiar with perl so i cant help you here 
 just curious what you think is disqualifying 
 my primary concern is that there are unreferenced sections its a wellwritten article and the pictures are amazing but i think the sourcing is really holding it back uN 
 but if you want to change it back to bclass you will have no objection from me uN 
 thanks i have adjusted the zoo banner to reflect this and put it on my to do list you have marked the section with no citations so i will concentrate there 
 theres always more to do uN 
 moved the discussion here for wider input 
 in you changed the latest preview release to N can you please provide a source for this until then i have reverted you changes thanks 
 thanks for clarifying this in the future though when you update the version leave a link to one of your sources in the edit summary box if you can 
 i hope that helps 
 thanks for the welcome to wikipedia 
 i tried your sugestion and thats a great idea i like it 
 lol you beat me to hitting up jen on twitter gave me a chuckle seriously though awesome work i kept looking at it but not having the motivation to do anything to fix it its on my watchlist so i can help maintain though 
 ah i see that 
 mike and i actually know each other from a completely different interwebz thing the only time we have interacted here was when we figured out we were both wikidorks admittedly i dont tweet much i mostly read and occasionally bug actors i follow when they are extra awesome in something every once in a while though tweetapalooza 
 it looks like you moved text from 
 sorry yeah i can see the need for that uN 
 thanks for the welcome message 
 sorry didnt know that template would do that 
 did you look at the article that was originally deleted which was nonsense about some guy born in N and the article you deleted i was going to delete the original article but academic challenger beat me to it however the recreated article was about a man who was the first armored car robber a completly different article and one that seems valid with a reference will you consider undeleting it or i can 
 thanks for restoring that to a certain extent it was the fault of a new user for creating a nonsense article in the first plcae cheers 
 on the jws article i definitely dont claim ownership even though i did create the article and have been the main editor until you made your move a few days ago i dont care for some of your more bold edits that seem to be based only on a whim and feel entitled to change those i wonder if you take exception to my edits on the article now perhaps forgetting that i do have a big interest in it but certainly not claiming ownership im noticing once again that you immediately make corrections and changes to whatever my last edits are on any articles i work now same ole same ole problem i dont even have a chance to look at them for errors racking up a lot of edit counts for yourself from my work and making me feel really uncomfortable when editing once again and under pressure just wondering if it may be due to my edits to jws when you were expanding it btw do you need some help with the articles you have created some of them have not been worked for months now or since you first created them 
 also id rather the personnel sections go under the recording or composition section as this has more relevance than the list standing on its own id like to hear your thought cheers 
 on dexys midnight runners version it charted in the uk only sales figures were probably less than vms #N in the us the dmr are not themselves a continuing force in music like vm whose version will remain the definitive one so you bought a book and therefore you think the article should be mostly about their version so you can use the material i dont agree why dont you edit on their main article also and improve that with the book material you have im sure its needed 
 actually i think the contribution to the prose of the article is pretty much even looking through the edit history the reason why i want to get vans articles to ga is because nearly all the music articles arent actually music it frustrates me that artists such as madonna and lady gaga make up most of the gas i want to promote vans work by using wikipedia because im affraid it will all be forgotten when im older (dont get me wrong i like newer stuff like the 
 nice work on 
 thanks 
 have you noticed by any chance that i am working at adding new sections etc to the song articles im created there may not be any order to it but i plan on going down my list over this week and adding new sections rewording etc i thought you might do the same with yours and if i need any help with these kind of fixes on mine i will let you know 
 im sorry but i was really offended by your comments above i believe i have done nothing that you havent done whilst editing and i have done a lot to change my editing style on your behalf i do believe i have apologised to you for much less than what you wrote to me above i have been waiting for a reply for three days and then i get a message saying that i should keep to the N articles i have created until you allow me to edit the others im truly sorry i wasnt around to create them before you did when i was N but if i had other people would always be welcome to edit them in good faith and within the rules of wikipedia i must remind you of this sentence in 
 and you have just done what you have been arguing against on queen of the slipstream your arguments dont stack up 
 this is rather silly isnt it i do believe queen of the slipstream is on my song articles created list and im only doing the same work im doing on the others i just want to be left to work on my own projects without your taking over in a bold manner i wasnt bothering you when i started these edits i only asked you to do your own so that you wouldnt be jumping all over me when i am working 
 and the one i just edited a few hours ago happened to be the one you edited first anyway i thought i had created that one i must have got it muddled with 
 for gods sake this is ridiculous i cant ever get anything done because of this it was a project that i thought of and was only editing on my own song articles just so there wouldnt be any discussion or anything to argue about dont you have anything else to do but this talk page arguing i find it very counterproductive i only comment here when i feel like i have to in order to be able to work productively why i know you must be able to edit on other things why only copy for the most part what i am doing this same issue has been discussed ad nauseum yes you can follow me around and edit on top of me according to wiki rules but when you know i find it disruptive why do you do it 
 well i guess i was pretty upset we just dont see eye to eye no matter how much discussion on my part it seems like you never really read what i write look how i started this out i spelled out what i was doing on the song articles and for how long and also let you know that i wasnt doing anything on yours so that you could do exactly the same type of work i was doing if you wanted without any discord queen of the slipstream was included on my list and i took a chance doing it today so i wouldnt forget about it i had no idea that you would take exception or that you wouldnt be able to see it was exactly the same editing i was doing on the others and nothing else it wasnt to get your goat i didnt say i wouldnt work with you on improving the articles i just wanted to hurry through this project without interruptions and get it done whats wrong with that im not keeping you from working on anything only requested you let me do very specific work on my own song articles for this week i dont think that is out of line or i wouldnt have ever brought it up 
 im not bothered about your project editing the song articles because you have explained you dont want me getting in the way and i respect that but what im worried about is being able to edit these articles in the future because at the moment im seeing one rule for you and one rule for me you dont like me editing an article just after you have edited it which you made clear in the discussion above but recently you have edited articles that i have edited the same day or the day after these examples go against how you are telling me to edit and shows that your comment is false because i started various things on the vm pages recently and you came in and edited straight after i have made an effort to keep out of your way i dont mind you editing the same article as me the same day or the day after but i fail to see how you can accuse me of anything if you are doing exactly the same thing 
 your ability to cite N isolated examples over a period of N months shows a proclivity for debate or argument that i dont want to expend my energy on only i can know what i have endured since you first started editing as a fourteen year old in march N i was welcoming and patient and you learned enough to get started from me and we have been learning alongside each other over time about better editing im talking here about habitual editing problems that affect our ability to work together as a team this is about applying like edits to the appropriate articles and how it takes a certain amount of concentration to get the job done and how many times you have observed what i was doing and took over the project in the past no i cant cite dates etc but i know its something i often overlooked and didnt challenge you on but i have less patience anymore and less ability to concentrate just be a little patient with me here and a little understanding i dont have the time or inclination to keep up this arguing 
 limitations should be clearly stated not dodgingly sprinkled some of this information is not already included and is necessary for a complete and unbiased description for example the photography issue you are referring to does not make any mention of its limitations with image texting and as such is misleading the subject of the iphones limitations are noteworthy and should not be dodged 
 hello again i prefer to maintain all communication within wiki much more practical regarding sending images as text with a first or second generation iphone it is not possible i know this from personal experience because i own one perhaps it is possible in the newest version but the article related to the iphone in general as such your comment is incorrect happy trails 
 please do not make assumptions its very offensive i live in the usa 
 hi thats okay with me i will restore the chronological order cheers 
 hi mathwiz i was wondering whether i can use your welcoming code do i just add the code to my 
 i hope you enjoy the tool 
 thank you for stepping in i was hoping for someone with a clear levelheaded mind when i looked at your homepage i liked what i saw and i would like to nominate you for admin would that be something you might consider and mdash 
 paul i was thinking of the same thing these days looking forward to a positive answer 
 thanks for the vote of confidence sebastian oleg sure either of you can nominate me if you like it will mean more grunt work which is good for the soul i suppose 
 ok its out see 
 your comments on 
 go to 
 draft attempted you have been more patient than my comment deserved 
 i have changed my signature to make the @ orange now that i look at the newer version i can see that it is better and glares less thanks for bringing this up i dont mind its a very minor price to pay especially considering i could just use the standard signature (
 was marking the addition of a 
 oops sorry my mistakeshouldnt edit while im on the phone i guess 
 no problem mistakes will happen and this wasnt a bad one just dont try and pull that sort of stuff with 
 cheers 
 you recently tagged an image that i uploaded as having no license the template states you should leave tag on the talk page of the uploader even though the image was on my watchlist please do so in the future thanks 
 sorry about that i normally check if the user is stilla round and let them know i must have gotten sloppy it seems that with N per cent of untagged images the uploader is no longer an active wikipedian with regards to the actual picture does it fall under the us government pd license 
 the status of maryland state government images is not mentioned on wikipedias image tagging page i would assume it is actually under copyright and not in the public domain do you have reason to think otherwise 
 i know i get sloppy sometimes while doing such repetitive tasks en masse as for the picture i used to be extremely active in school articles and i one day decided to take a usgs aerial photo of the school and upload that sparked a whole slew of controversy with the end result being that usgs aerial photos are pd they even have their own tag too anyways that debate kind of made me fearful of tagging images so i dont get involved in that stuff i dont see any fitting category under 
 from what i can tell some states in the us release their works as public domain while most retain copyright by teh fact that both the montgomery public schools page and the montgomery county pages are marked copyrigthed i assume they do have copyright protection in maryland i am not sure of the copyright rules in the us but in australia is automatic and does not have to be claimed if this is the case in the us i would guess it needs to be deleted i notice it isnt actually used in any articles in the first place though it is now fully accepted on wikipedia that any work of the federal government is in the public domain well done on getting the usgs stuff through 
 okay thanks for clarifying this i have speedied it under gN rather than waiting for iN 
 thanks for that 
 thanks 
 hello and thanks for asking me to review your article unfortunately im taking a little break from wikipedia activities for about a month to deal with some family matters and wont really be able to take this on right now i will say though that on a quick reading it looks like a really interesting article i wish you all the best with it and look forward to reading it more fully 
 i dont really want to do this but im wondering if you would please reconsider the 
 other than that you are an extremely well qualified candidate you have N edits and almost N in the wp namespace i will compromise with you since your debate with aecis ended nicely and your argument here seems both friendly and flawless if you can demonstrate to me one improvement in your debates before your rfa ends please post it on my talk page and i will gladly change to support just one improvement it could be by kindly asking me to vote for you by leaving comments on your own rfa page by further compromising with aecis or by engaging in a discussion somewhere else i do believe you have what it takes now just prove you can improve 
 by the way i like the link to 
 thats one example i dont have all that many others because i dont do the talk page of contentious article thing so much anymore thats why actually my little musical note redirects to 
 thanks i hope you are feeling better too happy editing 
 hello the stuart i completed a ga review of the 
 i have left my final comments on this article on the ga page once these are taken care of the article will be good to go for ga status please let me know if you are still working on this article 
 if this threatens my adminship i apologise from my point of view i posted on a talk page in good faith i never lied i never tried to offend i merely defended myself thank you 
 now back to your rfa i know you are a superior candidate for sysop rights you have about N edits with almost N in the wp namespace etc etc etc however durin pointing out one weak spot unfortunately hurt your position more than pointing out five strengths would have helped its just human nature finally you said i understand that adminship is no big deal i disagree with that statement sure adminship 
 thank you 
 thanks for your expedient response im sorry i couldnt get back to you sooner but i was sick yesterday and slept through the afternoon and evening when i normally edit wikipedia your reasons are flawless so i will change my vote in just a minute thank you for asking me so kindly too it just emphasizes your fifth point im sure you will make a great admin so good luck on your rfa 
 version N of 
 id like to assume good faith but considering the fact that you find the idea of the macedonian language laughable thats quite hard oh and agreeing with a blatant povwarrior doesnt help so if you could point out your neutrality that would help a lot peace 
 yeah im sure everything is censored as you say its all an antibulgarian conspiracy only you guys know the truth eh sorry if you get offended but i cant take you seriously at all have fun trying to push your idiotic fringe view 
 its just a reflex 
 vandalism what do you call filing up my discussion page with this nonsense when i clearly said at the top not to what is wrong with you 
 alright then what would you rather have me do obviously you know what you are doing wrong so why not ask for help before you mass upload files 
 i didnt mass upload files if you actually look at when those files were uploaded its been over several years if they arent right then delete them i dont care but dont fill up my discussion page with a million of your little warnings besides how am i supposed to correct all of this stuff by march N nd anyway 
 i dont see any discussion about your block of rexnl 
 sorry i was about to leave a message on his talk page when i saw that i had new messages i then responded to those left blatantvandal messages on the ip addresses involved and then had to leave to watch the super bowl forgetting to leave a message for rexnl 
 i blocked him for N hours several ips have been vandalizing the page with similar abusive edit summaries 
 thanks for taking care of it im going to go watch the 
 any additions or corrections would be greatly appreciated i am really trying to focus on the roll of the militia during the reconstruction conflicts unfortunately due to the legislature abolishing the office of adjutant general at the end of reconstruction we have very few militia records from the period we actually know a lot more about the militia in the territorial days than the milita druing the reconstruction period i am very interested in any information that you have that gives the actual units that existed how they were organized and who led them aleutianN N N november N 
 i just read through the ga discussion on your brooks baxter article i admire your presistance ga status seems to be alot of work i reviewed the list of online sources you provided these do a good job of sumerizing the political conflict but provide little detail on the militia i know the state archives has some information but again its mainly limited to the political side of the conflict did the thesis that you refered to have any references to the militia and its organizationaleutianN N N november N 
 in addition nonnotable website is not a criterion for speedy deletion i have afdd the page instead m@thwizN N N february N 
 isnt a warning the template says that the user may continue editing and that he may be blocked if he continues to vandalize not that he is actually going to be blocked 
 yes anonvandal works but blatantvandal can be used for either user names or really obvious vandalism the message means that the ip can continue constructive edits but that he or she will be blocked if he or she vandalizes 
 ok thanks i will use that in the future 
 pi forever p 
 thats the spirit well i already wrote it down and i wanted a friday about two months from now so i arbitrarily chose fri N apr N although your idea for pi days is a good one 
 N pi days 
 ec as i said to matt its a learning experience i didnt forget you either i wrote down in my calendar rfa N admins see feb talk archive while that technically includes you my ability to decipher my crude notes two months from now is yet to be determined 
 you recently tagged the article 
 yes it had a slightly different name but its the same topic 
 thank you when the title of the article for speedy deletion is different from the one deleted via afd it doesnt link to the csd template this can be resolved by using though that has to be done manually as twinkle doesnt do it uN 
 thanks i figured i was doing something wrong but i couldnt find a place to provide the afd link i had it ready but couldnt feed it to twinkle anywhere and mdash and nbsp

 speaking from bitter experience you are in for a lot of resistance based on scant little logic and scads of emotion and mdash 
 actually my evil plan is to invite much discussion then wear down all those who oppose my will with voluminous explanations of why mine is the path of righteousness who needs logic when you have got verbosity and mdash and nbsp 
 as 
 i see you did the same thing to 
 give me N mintues and ill try to make a mark up of whats happening on certain computers 
 cool thanks and mdash and nbsp 
 ive drawn up a quick whats wrong on my other account and left the issues i have with it below the boxes 
 what browsers do you have available right now where this happens browser name and version please and my thanks and mdash and nbsp 
 yes its the cert and sometimes sales that do it on all computers i have the newest firefox and internet explorer thats not meant to sound cocky lol right now im on my laptop however on my other computers they have smaller screens and on those on the text appears like ive shown on the page i linked 
 question @clk you used stylewidthN emfontsizeN per cent or to show that the certification gets warped but we are proposing the use of stylewidthN emfontsizeN per cent or i know it sounds silly but could you confirm whether the proposed code with N per cent makes things better or worse also could you confirm the exact browser and resolution size when this had occured 
 the N per cent doesnt do it if its N per cent or higher its makes the text go funny i just copy and pasted from kesha to show what was happening also i just realized this is the only computer the text is fine but this is windows vista the rest are xp or something else where the text goes funny could that have anything to do with it on all computers i use firefox N and the sizes and res are all different 
 could you try specifiying the column size and then see if it alters the outcome 
 hi there i will make it short we have similar characteristics as wikipedians in terms of edit count and counter vandalism as a fellow peer would i have your support in an rfa thanks 
 if you promise not to canvass for votes anymore show me examples of your conflictresolution skills and start to edit afd more then yes i will vote for you speaking of which i might just nominate you for afd on let me check fri N apr N yes i have some weird habits dont ask 
 #i must ask you this do cons out number pros through my fair deductions the one point i can see for not having a mop just yet is afd votes but i am sure you can appreciate the many other valid reasons i should have a mop thanks for the feedback 
 im sorry about my assumption but i did check your contributions to see if you had canvassed other users and i just assumed that your would canvass for more votes given an rfa in the near future as for interioteditcountcategorism i usually look at talkspace edits simply because user talkspace edits dont mean much while you have N usertalkspace edits the majority of them are warnings for vandalisms and its impossible to sort through N edits to see how many of them acutally involve a dispute and resolution while its much easier just to look at main talkspace edits i appreciate your efforts on 
 i primarily use the recent changes page for my vandalism patrol 
 as i said above i use 
 in fact i used cdvf not too long ago and it works well but thanks for the tip 
 keep wikiing dude 
 i will keep clement i on my watchlist i will not have much time over the next six weeks though keep sticking to sources and being watchful for presentations that do not acknowledge alternative psov you are outstanding at both good luck with forming your own pov as you compare those of different sources regards 
 no wikipedia is based upon citation and until you or anyone else can provide such citation irrelevant and useless 
 please dont threaten me it is you who is defying wikipedias rules whereas i am enforcing them uN 
 please dont be ignorant while you are at it why dont you remove the entire episodes plot summary because we cant be sure that they were mocking barack obama there might be another barack obama in the united states this need to be cited the references are obvious an there doesnt need to be citations stop reverting the changes now 
 you are splitting hairs the idea that it could be about another barack obama is ridiculous and frankly childish the socalled cultural references however are mere speculation theres no proof until someone can provide it about the references being true uncited material will be removed uN 
 im mocking you there are references in there that are quite obvious not speculation what would you have me do cite a website with the aliens script and point out to the part where paxton delivers those lines in the exact same way a video perhaps 
 no because thatd be 
 since you are being immature and recoculous about the situation then you find a citation for the reference and quit complaining abou it 
 the onus is on the person who adds the speculation its not up to wikipedias editors to clean up other peoples chaotic additions if you wish to call me immature then you are calling wikipedias very basis immature uN 
 are any of these better merely different how why or why not explain and mdash and nbsp 
 apologies i was updating a bunch of ke$ha pages on this computer i notice no difference they all look fine im actually at my other house right now so i will not be able to check whether they have been corrected or not until tomorrow at noon and yes im in school but currently i do online school cause i have sports so online is much easier 
 okay thanks i will wait to see whatever results you can report and mdash and nbsp 
 yup just waiting around for some results and mdash and nbsp 
 hi i have been working on trying to get awb to save show changes and preview by calling the javascript behind the buttons rather than simulating actually clicking the buttons as it does at present i have found it a bit difficult but have progressed so now it can call some java unfortunately i just cant work out how to call the java behind the buttons i suspect you probably know as you have the expert java user box thing on your user page any thoughts would be greatly appreciated i will send you the test program to demonstrate how to do what i have worked out + newest awb if you want many thanks 
 although it is more complicated than this single line so i will send you the code if you want to see it 
 i havent been on wikipedia for two days so i will check my email and look into this when i have time i think though that using javascript will eliminate the outoffocus problem its simple enough to submit a form using javascript the problem is telling wikipedia whether you want it to save preview or show diffs 
 if we could eliminate the outoffocus problem that would be pretty much the last annoying problem dealt with which would be great i just emailed you the files good luck 
 i think ck meant he doenst like that we have decided to include the years at the end of the table and that i didnt use rowspan 
 look under 
 i did say on the project talk page that you could include year after titles if you wanted to its not a big deal as long as they dont appear in the first column 
 agreed i think the year as second column would look much better myself would that solve issue N for you then and mdash and nbsp 
 yes from top to bottom in the article they need to be in the same row like they currently are now thats the issue i have having them in random places they need to be consistent 
 yup kelly rowland discography is still being updated i did the music videos a while ago as a livedemo for what could be achieved dont use it to judge standards just yet lol alls good then lets see if we can smash the first issue 
 lil i have copied my version of the table with centered years as the second column into 
 hi just thought i would let you know i like the new layout you are using on your user page with the rounded corners gosh thats a sweet set of skills pretty much the best that i know of you must get all the girls 
 okay now im the one being random anyways thanks for the positive feedback 
 i wasnt sure why you are on my watchlist either we where discussing an untagged image back in january so that is probably it i noticed you added the rounded corners and i hadnt seen it before on wikipedia so thought i would check it out and then the heading skills reminded me of the hillarious scene in nd where they are discussing how they are going to get girlfriends and what skills they have anyway i guess you had to be there thanks for the vote catch you round 
 oh i remember that discussion about the image now i searched my talk page for your name but couldnt find it the discussion was archived how do you monitor such a big watchlist i disabled the option to add all pages i edit to my watchlist (see 
 the top is of kesha discography notice the text in cert and sales goes underneath on a smaller res it breaks up more other then that its fine with rowland the text and boxers are bigger again the text is broken up this may be what is suppose to happen but what is not suppose to happen is you see the back arrow i drew there is a little grey field where the web page ends and you cannot scroll over to see the rest of the text the box overlays and keeps going but you cannot see what is there it just cuts it off on an ever smaller res more text is cut off where you cannot see 
 as for the second the new table is slightly larger so you are only experiencing this problem now but hey this discog tables are fairly decent and much larger tables exist in wikipedia tables do have minimum width so whatever you do you will always find a smaller resolution too small for any table in such cases its ok if you have to scroll its more important to be able to read the table thats why wed rather encourage normal text size yours 
 the text aside thats not the issue the issue is if you reread i said that with the box or text being so big the computer isnt reading it right or something and its cutting off part of the sales section and you cannot scroll over and see it make sense 
 i can see that but want to make sure that i understand it correctly it appears from the small image that the only thing you cant bring into view is a onepixel wide right border true and mdash 
 is the solution to insert a code that automatically makes all text in a discography table appear at N per cent font size 
 im not yet convinced this has anything to do with fontsize im still trying to understand what hes seeing as the problem condition in any case the example is currently using N per cent fontsizes in columns which appear to be plenty wide when normal is N per cent and we are trying to get him to N per cent i dont see how the N per cent difference from N per cent could have an effect on his horizontal scrolling on the other hand he lets his browser gets updated while he sleeps so i cant be sure some behavior wasnt affected by some recent update about the same time as we made it wider and mdash and nbsp 
 i honestly done have a clue what it is i think it may be mozilla 
 actually according to some stuff that a nonwiki editor friend of mine says regarding the programming of lower resolutions the squashing of such text is normal as hardware running at N by N px cannot process lengthy horizontal scrolling however i have been advised that from the standard settings of N x N px and above on either xp or vista there should be no issues note apparently this will happen with any kind of html formatting not just wikipedia 
 thank you how nice its really odd that you of all peolple are greeting me now of all times since i was just reading about you on 
 can you please drop by 
 hey dont mention it and that is a bit odd cheers 
 if its a small world then its definitely a small pedia 
 well said if i ever start a quotations page that will be the first entry d 
 i just realized that you deleted 
 if you disagree please let me know 
 hi is delaid 
 works for me in monobook 
 agree the geiss screensaver and winamp plugin are quite famous uN at least among many digital audio enthusiasts i was just about to add the article myself and also noticed the previous deletion 
 i appologise for reverting the article user 
 hmmyour best bet right now would be to do all the changes you think are necessary to the temp article and contact an admin to do the cleanup a list of admins can be found at 
 and happy first edit from me too i just got hooked on the 
 happy happy happy 
 happy edit day 
 thanks for the headsup im a little confused with whats going on there 
 hmm 
 hi there i was wondering if you could just give your input to a 
 by the way i realized i never said thank you for your input so thanks so much 
 ha ha that seems like ancient history already id already forgotten about it its a shame we spent so much time on such an obvious case of deletable material you are quite welcome in any case and mdash and nbsp 
 i know eh that was a really great essay you wrote there haha your eloquence is admirable p 
 strictly speaking an rfb would go to 
 sorry about that i should have said mfd but forgot as for speedy deletion it is not a valid 
 well really the speedy deletion criteria are for things in the main space not project or user space we delete user pages on request after all there has been some 
 and may make the job a little bit easier 
 thanks rexx and and mdash and nbsp 
 what is wrong with people tt is pathetic and is always trying to get me banned so dont even bother doing anything that would be appricated 
 dont get angry at the person breaking up the fight 
 im glad you broke it up cause his always doing that then reporting me but i see on his talkback him asking you to report me and you apparently agreeing explain please 
 im not agreeing with anything im just making sure that if he does decide to make an rfc on you he knows that he shouldnt be the one to send you the obligatory you have had an rfc filed against you message 
 ok understood cheers 
 i had deliberatly put tbr because several people in the fl review asked for it additionally because the album is currently only confirmed for uk release it seemed important to point that out whereas previous the release stood worldwide 
 hunh funny i dont know why theyd ask for it seems weird that they would want something thats different usually they want something thats the same although i have seen tables where two different indicators are used one for not charted and one for not released tbr wasnt one of them though anyway i wont meddle there anymore leave it as you think it needs to be and are you brave enough to try changing for the new 
 yeah its on my list of things to do along with the stack of work i have got from university there really isnt enough hours in the day 
 i see you are setting sale against the storm with 
 good luck it took me longer than i expected although rihannas discog is rather large and i took the opportunity to convert most of the tables to list the peaks horizontally i spend too much time trying to figure out what peak some editor has changed from N to N when they are horizontal its usually possible to see a title either fore or aft so it all took me almost two hours when id originally figured N uN minutes ha and mdash and nbsp 
 its still a work in progress no i did an example in one of my sandboxes a few weeks ago where i come up with the conclusion that i prefer horizontal layouts i was already using it for the albums table theres no automatic way to do it but its easier if you copy or uN or or uN or or uN or or uN or or uN or or uN or or uN or or uN or or uN or or uN or or then input the peaks rather than try and modify the old ones 
 in fact i tried to create a legitmate article for pokerealm and it was marked by deletion because it was considered advertising so i dont understand why false statements are being allowed when i couldnt even put up a factual entry if you are an admin i request for you to blank the page and lock it from future edits 
 hello the 
 hello the same user also created 
 i joined esperanza on elections began on N february N at N so i joined before the elections began 
 if you disagree with anything i said please just let me know 
 ah my bad about the clarifying box however it said you had to be a member to vote and since you werent on the members page you werent a member sorryalso you should have looks at the main page anyway as much as i like kf someone has to win we cant have a tie im sure joanneb will make a good adv council member too 
 i am on the member page in fact i added myself on N february N at N does this mean my vote will count 
 no you were reverted the message at the time clearly stated that the page is locked and people wishing to be members should requests as such on the talkpage ergo you were not a member and hence were ineligible to vote sorry for the confusion 
 i just realized it was in the vandalized state as well since i nominated it am i allowed to delete the nomination thanks 
 someone will probably close the nom as withdrawn at some point but if you want do it yourself see the instructions at 
 i know you must be busy right now working on 
 as far as the guideline goes im considering it approved although i still fear its more accurate to say that it wasnt roundly arejected i really wanted more involvement in the discussion but it remained a small group most of the time nevertheless im starting making a few updates albeit slowly to see what kind of yelling and screaming and howcouldyou results from it i think the revisions described in the new guideline are sound but if theres going to be howling and whining leading to a change in the changed guideline i dont want to have too many articles to have to change a second time so i will be going slowly for the next few days and mdash and nbsp 
 hm i understood im editing a discography and updating it in your opinion should i stop and wait or can i continue thanks 
 naw go ahead be 
 ok thanks ] 
 thanks i did know about that but i forgot it while i was converting the tables its done now i also converted the tables in 
 oic my very best wishes for the festive season 
 have a great christmas mraustralia keep up the guitar playing 
 i hope santa brings me new strings 
 related note shouldnt the albums in the singles chart be linked per 
 i see that 
 thanks makes sense and another question if you dont mind should associations be linked to the countries in the certifications column because it isnt at 
 in reversesideways order as i was writing my reply to you i realized the other charted songs thing hadnt been added yet so i decided to do that tonight yes ricky nelson would be better linked imo and im not really sure where we stand on linking providers behind the country names as supreme king of wikipedia i think id leave them unlinked but as just a regular editing peasant like your own good self i dunno i think others might prefer linking you might start a discussion about it and mdash and nbsp 
 that is odd i have tweaked it slightly so maybe it will work in the next release 
 thats good advice good night 
 but im not exactly happy with the results of one of the discogs i have converted to 
 yes those row headings for song look very different from what we are used to and im not sure im satisfied yet myself i do have some alternate formatting ideas in my drawer here but im not ready to bring them out yet in the meantime and for what you are seeing on scherzingers page try adding the closing quotation mark on your elements see if you like the resulting effect better and mdash and nbsp 
 actually now that the span thing is working correctly im ok with it thanks 
 are you sure 
 now deleted in case you hadnt noticed thanks for the tip pascal and mdash and nbsp 
 first of all isnt it about time to archive this page its upwards of N kb next i have a question about your bot smackbot what settings was it using when the bot made you can check out 
 problem fixed uN sorry for the inconvenience i try to check my edits carefully but occasionally something gets overlooked it was my error not awbs ah the beauty of the revert function and rarr 
 with nobody i meant that nobody answered my question after i asked some question please dont understand me wrong i just wanted that someone might help me however i will delete this peer review and make a review in the fl nomination directly cheers 
 good luck and mdash and nbsp 
 the positions that deivsonprescovia arent from hotN brasilcom and are being cited to the physical magazine which is permitted may i suggest that you revert yourself and undo your warning and mdash 
 i seem to have left this right after you logged off for the day i went ahead and undid your reversions and mdash 
 and thanks for reverting me i hadnt so much logged off for the day as found my connection to wikipedia broken this is the kind of methadone that inspires me to go do something else besides injecting myself with wp junk and mdash and nbsp 
 one problem for me is not knowing much about brazilian charts everything i know about them i know from 
 and are hopefully enough just curious what languages can you comfortably wade through and mdash 
 yes looks great thanks i do german some rusty spanish and clumsy bitwise french in addition to english and some no japanese except what i remember from reading clavells shogun ruN dmaji only which uh limits me somewhat the rest i have to take to google translate or similar and mdash and nbsp 
 hi efe you have given me some advice with the article in the past so i was hoping if you could maybe give me some input on the pr stage d all constructive criticism is welcomed thanks very much my friend 
 sure we will do 
 thanks very much for your input thus far i have addressed most of your concerns so take a look 
 i dont know what to say it works for me you may have to add wikipedia and that site to your exceptions list in firefox preferences or disable popup blocking altogether for it to work does the regex work on awb i could just use that its no problem 
 silly me it does work but only when im on the edit page i kept trying it when i wasnt editing and it wasnt working but when i clicked on edit this page and clicked the bookmark voila i will try to perfect the regexes as soon as i can i just have to iron out that one problem 
 i got it it took me a while to figure out the discrepancies between awb and your bookmarklet but i finally got it there is just one more bug i want to fix but dont have to i will work on that problem and then give you the regexes 
 if it doesnt work just tell me and i will fix it in a few million jiffies 
 im testing it out now and its working great i dont mind running it several times thanks a lot this will help me out greatly 
 i assure you the readding of the link you removed was strictly a human error which i had forgotten about i didnt insist it was french i actually hadnt realized the language paremeter said french which is why after the reversion i if we compromise i think languageenglish or german would be more appropriate 
 okay go ahead and mdash and nbsp 
 sorry john i was using 
 well that should teach you not to use tools to make your work easier you should do things the slow tedious equally errorprone manual way like i do and mdash and nbsp 
 the above image was nominated for deletion i was about to delete it but it is not obvious to me that you were ever informed about the nomination the nomination was due to questionable status i will hold off on deleting the image for a while in the hopes that you can respond and clarify if you are the author of the image 
 thank you for contacting me actually i dont remember where i got the image when i first started editing i was really involved with school articles and i was helping various other wikipedians write quality articles about their schools i did not take the picture myself but i think i got it off the schools website if i did though the picture has since been removed from their website i hope this clarifies things 
 hi im working on a discog 
 sure lemme take a look and mdash and nbsp 
 there i did a couple of teeny things does that fix everything whatd i miss and mdash and nbsp 
 its one more thing i was wondering about why the year is so wide in the featured singles 
 does the extra width change as you resize your browser window what browser are you viewing it in when you see this do other browsers show the same thing and its just this one table huh and mdash and nbsp 
 now i have tried firefox and it is fine but in google chrome in the featured singles the year column was just as wide and looked like the title or song column 
 hunh researching and mdash and nbsp 
 i have noticed that too when making changes to 
 id like to have the date to the left of the time how to do this please help please comment on my talk thank you uN 
 thanks for the edit but its a bit broken it shows as N N apr N uN 
 ok please dont worry about it the error is in msie not firefox thanks for the help uN 
 right here at 
 wow you actually beat me you supported the rfa before i even notified you on your talkpage you are really way too good at this whole wikipedia thing 
 i was just looking through your contribs talk page etc in an effort to determine if i should nominate you for adminship you have had a significant drop in edits only N last month total are you still active in wikipedia if you are just show up around wikipedia a bit more and i will nominate you in N weeks if i dont hear a response from you on my talk page i will email you and then assume that you are unfortunately not on wikipedia anymore but lets not dwell on such possible outcomes be an optimist i hope to see you around soon 
 thank you for the vote of confidence though 
 please look at the content currently at 
 huh none of columns for years are too wide in your sandbox they are perfect width 
 well damn that almost makes me mad it doesnt tell me anything i was hoping to learn maybe candy will get some different results candyo i need you and mdash and nbsp 
 no problem haha maybe a poke would get his attention p 
 hello there you have proposed the article 
 ow wow i didnt know that thanks for letting me know however in that specific case the article was marked for speedy deletion under the criterion no content i felt that the article did meet the requirements for speedy deletion and hence i could have deleted it but as i put in the edit summary i felt there was room for expansion therefore i removed the csd tag and added prod i have not though readded prod because you removed it but if you feel that it deserves to be proded feel free to readd it 
 incidentally could you tell me where you got the idea to add without parameter nothing against you of course but i see several people doing this and i wonder whether we have a information text somewhere on wikipedia that needs to be amended best 
 yeah wikipedia does take a lot of my time but as shown by when bluemoose and adrian quit and then came back its highly addictive i havent had much time for wikithings so i havent been active in awb or irc but i will when i get more time thanks for checking up on me 
 since u helped out with the sock puppetry problem on the usher album articles before can u help me out with determing whether or not the ip editors to the 
 the edits to 
 can u do me a favor and revert the last edit to 
 hey you deleted sfedi heres the log N N april N mathwizN deleted sfedi why aN its an initiative of some sort not a person or a group or am i wrong its creator complained to me thanks 
 heres the definitely not an aN candidate i have applied for an undeletion at 
 very good thanks and mdash and nbsp 
 hi first of all i wish to tell you that i didnt want top be mean to you i do not want you build up a bad impression of me dance airplay is the same as dance singles search for all the billboard charts and you will see can we be friends i think it is the best way for us to work together or else we will keep on reverting each others edits 
 third id like to get along too im sorry for my mistake in not seeing the reffed mention in the prose i hope we wont have any more namecalling in the future and mdash and nbsp 
 thanx for doing that it helps me a lot 
 but how do i enter my username if the page is protected and im not an amin am i doing something wrong 
 would i put my monobookjs on my userpage or somewhere on my desktop 
 thank you soooo much 
 wait im still confused i feel so stupid right now i pressed ctrl then fN but nothing happened am i supposed to write something else that what is already there 
 i am using ie assuming that means internet explorer 
 usually thats because i dont know a good answer the problem is that the chart really should have three columns country chart and position i have abused the first column into doing double duty and now it hasnt got a really good succinct description and mdash 
 thanks i figured i got on the wrong list with you its okay if i make two columns then say provider and actual chart name the billboard chart only needs the one and mdash and nbsp 
 good enough i have just been a bit stressed and tired lately making me less capable of coherent thought and mdash 
 same here but i have been contributing here anyway hope things get better for you and mdash and nbsp 
 the editor that made this is arguing that another article includes more than N reviews therefore this one can what is the name of policy or guideline about not referring to other articles so that i can refer to it in explaining to him why his argument is wrong 
 i found this 
 by the way since its spring break im staying up late and doing most of my sleeping during daytime d 
 hmm i think there may be something wrong with my computer not vandalproof anyways you have been approved by a moderator 
 stop insulting me i just have computer problems 
 what what insult and mdash and nbsp 
 where in your sandbox i really dont prefer its like im the moron here and its not good only because i sometimes save the page until one subject was done it shouldnt be provide with sentences like above im sorry for the outstriking of your sigs or anything else but please dont write such sentences thank you cheers 
 i know a few words to get by what did you need to know anyway i can always ask my mate 
 maybe its a bit high as absolute value but as relative value i dont know none of my friends uses ie anymore thats for sure but opera and the other browsers are surprisingly popular nowdays uN 
 thanks for my mistakes lol 
 twerent nothin and mdash and nbsp 
 regarding i believe that the ip should not be unblocked but should instead be indefinitely banned it is the ip for a school and kids at that school can still read wikipedia just fine for research if they must and if they want to edit nothing is preventing them from creating a username and editing with that if you unblock the ip or let the block expire some students will make constructive edits however vandalism from others will strongly outweigh the positive contribs and the ip will inevitably be blocked again i also strongly discourage contacting school or school system it another use 
 well N hasnt been fixed yet so they would be restricted to editing at home i do agree that schools have a lot of vandalism i guess i was just trying to agf and allow a good faith user upon request i hear you with respect to school it staff most have no idea what a proxy server is let alone how to monitor wp access oh well its a fact of life i guess 
 oh i didnt know you cant edit with a username from a blocked ip because well i never did anything to get my ip blocked whats the N error i assume thats what doesnt allow you to edit from a blocked ip even with a username that should stop a lot of vandals who vandalize with an ip and then try to with a username but cant because their ip is blocked if only it worked the other way too once your username is blocked your ip cant create more usernames that would stop a lot of vandal socks 
 oh and i changed wait your turn to N because i thought that was the entry for s and m dont ask me why 
 um i dont want to be picky or ungrateful or anything but should i be able to see it because its right there i mean its really going to stand out when i nail it on my invisible barn and mdash and nbsp 
 haha very good 
 do you know if or how this can be done off the top of your head thanks 
 let me know if this doesnt work and please tell me when you are script is done so i can test it out 
 excellent i have fiddled around with it a bit and it works as desired thanks as you may have guessed i am totally new to js so i may take a while to get the actual link simplifyer working properly i think the problem is that you have linked http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitleusermartin or monobookjs or replacetabjs whereas you should have added bluemoose rather than martin also is there a program that you use to help generate the js or do you just experiment in the monobook thanks again 
 oh thanks for catching that what i do is in firefox i click on tools > javascript console and i can play a bit with code there to see what happens other than that i just test it in monobook 
 ah yes the console is useful also i have just found that dreamweaver is a fairly decent jscript ide although i guess i am too used to the ultra cool visual studio ide ps feel free to experiment in 
 very cool well done now i wonder what other features would be worth copying from awb 
 ok thanks thats great also i have moved the jscript to 
 again sorry if i did something wrong however can you answer to my questions or making suggestions instead of moving this unuseful sig around you could write something thank you 
 sorry i have withdrawn from 
 hey john one small favour i am planning to nominate 
 since i was looking mostly at the tables i noticed the headings about which i have a little comment my preference would be to change the charts subheading under charts and certifications to weekly charts so that its parallel to the yearend charts subheading however i havent been able to convince other editors of the value of this so if you dont want to change it i wont be too amazed good luck with the fan and mdash and nbsp 
 many many many thanks for the table tweakings really appreaciated and i am actually all for substituting the normal name charts with weekly charts as was done in the recent most music fa 
 any guesses as to previous accounts 
 the obvious guess is treemanshoe though i dont know that user well enough to say for certain early treemanshoe edits seem to have fewer summaries but comparing with 
 hi i just wanted to let you know i submitted the article for 
 supported good luckuN having an article on the main page is not for the faint of heart 
 thanks for your support you are right that main page exposure will apply a lot of new pressure on the article but hopefully it will only result in improvement thanks again 
 lol smooth very smooth i will have to remember to use that one in the future how are you anyways 
 yes im always looking for ways to fit more info politely into short edit summary spaces im doing alright thanks although i need to cut down my wp time in favor of the pesky real life stuff i have been trying to prune my watchlist and teach myself to better ignore unimportant edits i hope schools going well for you and mdash and nbsp 
 hmm well its been a while since i was at school im at university at the moment and dare i say the workload has increased at least N fold as for wiki well i semiretired but have a had a short burst of edits recently thanks to me needing a distraction from the real world things are a bit complicated with someone i wish to get romantically involved with so this is the perfect distraction (
 hello johnfrompinckney i am just letting you know that i declined the speedy deletion of 
 do you know the official sites for the canadian album charts and for the german album charts thank you 
 for this and similar questions you might be satisfied by 
 i dont quite understand while it does seem strange the yearend charts were referenced and lead to correct pages 
 hunh my bad i confess that i did not click through on even one of those links figuring that a redlink user id never heard of adding yearend charts in early december must be adding bogus crap i reverted without wasting the time to look at what must be complete hooey good thing i didnt decide to warn them too eh now to figure out what new madness billboard is up to this week or maybe its normal and mdash and nbsp 
 i see that today the N th of december the big list of yearend charts at shows them all with the date december N N now how did they manage that i wonder and mdash and nbsp 
 billboard are the one group you can trust to mess with dates arent they d 
 man if they would at least be a little transparent about it i could deal with it better and mdash and nbsp 
 they release the 
 yes it is pretty cool i have been using it quite a bit i will have a look at the final problem that needs ironing out thanks 
 hey i have made a function to help with categorising 
 looks great changing 
 great one small problem it changes 
 it still does for me i have added the example it changes also how come you removed the rest of the shortcuts in awb as far as i could see they do not conflict with or duplicate anyting thanks 
 ah i see some of them do conflict also i added some other examples that should not be changed by the formatter i will have a look at the regex myself later as well thanks 
 ok thats great i will add it too awb at some point as well try it on 
 hello i noticed you added a link for 
 hi i added the redlink to the 
 please have a look at 
 no of course i wont im not going anywhere near one of your nominations again if somebody else asked me for an opinion of the articles you have nominated id explain without hesitation that i oppose promotion since the articles are nowhere near fl quality but i refuse to waste my time interacting on your flc pages and mdash and nbsp 
 that is very sad the list is very near to become a fl it would be nice if you would help me cheers 
 why thank for you the regex tweak i am still a bit new with the more complex complexities of the regex so kudos to you for the aid 
 thanks for the regex tips i have gotten learn the ropes better as for the invisible textwellsometimes theres a ghost that floats around my userspacei dont understand it either but it has definitely happened to meweird huh 
 so what should we do to clean that chart performance section up should i go ahead and revamp the whole section i will remove unreferenced comments but i will make sure i try hard to find a proper source to back each claim before i remove anything 
 otherwise i would not be sad to see the felloffbutreenteredbutthen stuff removed although its in there presumably because somebody thought it was good or maybe they just had the info so they added it personally im not so great at adding sources i dig up elsewhere so if you want to work on it i will wish you the best of luck i felt bad adding all those ugly tags but i kept noticing stuff that wasnt covered if you can heal that you will have my gratitude and mdash and nbsp 
 lol i totally understand i will do my best to source verify and edit accordingly all the chart obsessive freaks who wanted to make sure every twist and turn was noted are the ones who made those ugly tags happen not you my dear 
 why does seem like a fictional claim 
 and what name failed the google test 
 but going to the asian vs white and asian thing blair has about N students about N of whom are magnet now i would say that most nonmagnet students are hispanic black or white with few asians that N per cent of blair students are asian this is about N or N or N students if there are few asians in the nonmagnet then all N asians must be in the magnet program meaning that almost N per cent of magnet students are asian granted maybe N per cent are white but N per cent is still not mostly white but again i goofed with the edit summary so i couldnt clarify that earlier thanks for catching me 
 i will fix the phrase then by the way the magnet at montgomery blair is approximately N per cent asian N per cent white N per cent africanamerican N per cent hispanic certainly that should qualify as mostly white and asian 
 only N per cent wow 
 can you take a look at 
 i looked i saw i commented and mdash and nbsp 
 hahahaha 
 hey you wouldnt happen to know how to make this 
 its quite common somebody moving around or creating a lot of music album entries put that comment everywhere notice how unnecessary has two cs which makes it spelled wrong can the regex be told not to look within commenting like that every time if so i could eliminate a lot of crud that gets through 
 i could do with your opinion at with some pretty determined editors who appear to be suggesting that all rihanna song are only r and b and no other genres 
 its kind of a shame im a caribbean person i dont quickly call things ska and i was uncomfortable with the genre at first too but influences are important enough to merit representation 
 agreed i have been meaning to thank you as well so thanks for your 
 hey no problem i always aim to please p 
 heyquestion i just noticed somethingis the 
 hi miko i have been out for a couple days so im sure what you are talking about that is i see a redlink for the article you are referring to so i gather the situation has resolved itself if i recall correctly i nominated the article for deletion i guess that worked i remember not liking the article for its triviality whatever references pointed to wp pages though would have been just more encouragement to drive a stake through it its hard to train ip editors en masse it seems we have to do it one by one sometimes although im sure many wp editors learned by seeing good role models we could try to be like that does that help and mdash and nbsp 
 it says i have version N 
 i have got it working now thanks 
 looking for advice on how to make things clear chartstats has switched from providing links with the song argument to using the id argument it no longer uses song but will still accept it and its a different number than the id i can add an id parameter but how can i a make this whole mess clear to people and mdash 
 so im lost until you can give me more specific pointers to a song you see this on and maybe how you got there sorry i cant help yet and mdash and nbsp 
 this is why i talk to people before plunging ahead if im confused i confuse them and then we muddle through it wasnt a change from song to id its a change from id to release if you turn the new backend on the links get presented as http or or wwwchartstatscom or releasephpreleaseN while with the backend off the same song is at http or or wwwchartstatscom or songinfophpidN if you have the new backend on its very difficult to get the correct value for id and mdash 
 okay thats more useful info im looking and mdash and nbsp 
 so how about a release parameter or maybe releaseid what did you have in mind do you want to have a bot change all the current songid usages to id seems like a lot of work for a small amount of clarity id ends up going away in a couple of months anyway give me a clue and i will start working up doc changes in a sandbox when or if we both like my explanation you can try to actually code it that way and mdash and nbsp 
 im not frightened of the code just the explanation for now i will add two parameters id and release id will act like songid does release will do the new url i will monitor use of songid and leave notes explaining the change to people once its dropped enough i will do a bot run clean out songid and desupport the parameter see if you can write something that makes sense and i will get the code in place right after christmas and mdash 
 lets make sure i understand this approach you want i should areplace the songid in the documentation with the id and release so that new instances of ukchartstats wont include songid yes the monitoring you are talking about is of new additions of ukchartstats to see that we dont pull the rug out from under too many people when songid suddenly doesnt work the way it did yesterday and this morning when they used it right and mdash and nbsp 
 right its easy for me to watch parameters i do it all the time i just place the article in special categories based on parameter combinations for example contains all articles that should be sourced to the occ website that are using chartstats because the editor didnt know better im going to wind up taking a bot to those as well and mdash 
 take a look at my 
 shouldnt there be instructions about examining the url to decide whether to use the id parameter or the release parameter and mdash 
 the above two images should be labeled with the tag as these images are works of employees of the united states department of education that were taken or made during the course of their official duties 
 they most definitely should not be labeled with that tag local school districts are not part of the us federal government the law that allows works of the federal government to be in the public domain does not apply to state county and local governments in any respect i have reverted your changes to those images

 hi i was intrigued by your assertion that global warming could become runaway because of positive feedback and that stefanboltzmann does not help us i looked at this paper which says physically the stefanboltzmann feedback becomes more negative and the water vapor feedback becomes less positive as the temperature increases both effects drive the system towards greater stability who is correct 
 hi thanks for the message i have just modelled the whole thing on a spreadsheet and got it to match ipcc figures first point to note is that estimates for forcing are just that estimates one paper estimates N w or m^N per k positive feedback for water vapour that approximately doubles the effect of coN the negative feedback of the fourth power in the stefan bolzmann quickly kicks in if however you assume N w or m^N per k then the positive feedback is enormous however i am not sure i have modelled this correctly because i think the forcing itself changes with temperature but its kind of intuitive anyway positive feedback is like balancing on a tightrope one slip and you are off the fact that the climate is remarkably stable within the noise suggests there is no strong positive feedback best 
 venus is an interesting one surface temperature is about N c but solar irradiance N as compared to earths N this would cause the surface temperature to be only N c higher than earth however venus atmosphere is almost all coN unlike earths although even that concentration does not explain the high temperature of venus 
 #did we rule it out as a reliable source 
 id like to keep bu results out of the same column as hot N peaks too but im not always successful there either and mdash and nbsp 
 hmm that was pretty much what i was thinking too although i did wonder if they had a use on individual song pages or in chart performance sections 
 oh for me its just fine if theres some good reason to talk about bu performance in the performance text its harder to work bu details into a discography though when presumably theres a lot more to tell about than how a certain song that didnt chart on the hot N hovered just off shore an artist worthy of a discog article has too much more notable stuff to find time to say up yours darling made it to N on the bu chart once discog tables are usually full of real charts so theres no room there either and mdash and nbsp 
 hello thanks for reporting to 
 okay thanks and mdash and nbsp 
 you really think that this song was number one on the week of x is a copyright violation the lists of numberone hits are no more a copyvio than your average chart performance section in a song article ten pound hammer 
 when we copy a page of numberone hits and make a wp article of numberone hits out of it yeah the chart performance sections (as i mentioned in 
 i think postdlf has made a convincing argument that this isnt a copyvio ten pound hammer 
 hope to hear your views even if they more closely match my opponents 
 as to my views my view is that you will have trouble being successful on wikipedia if you think of your fellow editors as your opponents the insults disparaging remarks namecalling etc wont help either and mdash and nbsp 
 most editors are finehsb seems to have attracted a nest of noninclusionists someone who opposes you is an opponent someone who opposes for bizarre and unlikely reasons is in need of a little exposure to the light of day i will try in future to speed up my notifications to faster than within the day maybe i could even get them to match the N minute unnannounced revert speed of good faith edits of your fellow traveller i reserve the right to criticize petty personal obstructionism and cabals wherever i see or find them are you being honest when you say you were unaware for N hours yours in wikijesus 
 hi if boltons page cant have the squad list the way i set it can we make it in the style of 
 hi if 
 wow whats up with the mean edit summary all i did was add sources to help out a perivously not well sourced section and i get my head bit off 
 hi static im sorry you thought it was mean that was absolutely not my intention i only meant to communicate that we havent yet found ref citations to support all of the release dates being claimed there happy editing and mdash and nbsp 
 hi john i hate to bother you again but i was wondering if you could please give me a little assistance with something that i havent been able to work out im doing some work on an article thats currently in my userspace 
 hi again john nevermind that last request because someone else already came through and figured it out thanks anyway 
 i have an interest of international sports and wanting to expand the stubs of international sports clubs i became not interested in american sports thats why i want to expand the international sports stubs is that enough for you 
 thanks you need anything to help or you are fine each day the each clubs stub will added to the watchlist so im glad to have you as my partner for expansion of international sportss clubs im not sure if i can start an article about international sports clubs 
 its been an incredibly long time since i last saw your name in an edit summary and since i last spoke to you just wanted to see if your still editing and how you are really and mdash 
 i miss the action here and i wonder whats been decided in certain areas of wp as i havent been following any discussions still i think i need to stay away for a while longer my life is not yet properly balanced hope you are doing well may peace harmony and patience be yours happy editing and mdash and nbsp 
 you may want to look into for 
 thanks for the advice i had been thinking about whether it was not sufficiently original while the text is not a problem i think the f circle does actually have some originally to it i might ask at mcq i didnt know that existed 
 thanks for that i see there is now further info on the route N article thanks also for the information re the mayfield road lights id assumed it had been kept because theres no point removing it and it might need to be used again one day ps on talk pages if you sign by putting ~~~~ at the end of your comment it puts your username on the end and then the bots wont come round and do it once again thanks for the info much appreciated 
 thank you 
 also you pointed seaman and wanchope should not be there as they didnt play enough games for the club i would like to add deyna made just N league appearances in his three year spell keen to hear from you 
 noted players would be better i guess im also adding a couple of new important players as tony book i also created an article about 
 i believe manchester city N win over huddersfield is their record league win at least thats what most of the websites and magazines believe its right as the goal difference between the teams is N even though city once scored N in a game they conceded three so the margin was smaller thoughts 
 what about this N as the record league win and N as the most goals scored in a league game it would make justice to both wins imo anyway i created an article about mel machin take a quick look please if you have the time 
 regarding the trolleybus design this could be worth including if it could be 
 as an aside i thought id better say wikiproject optare has sort of run its course now the main aim was to keep everything together while the whole optareeast lancesdarwen group events happened and to make sure the development in new models was covered which is has done fingers crossed optare is more stable now 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or just stopping by to tell you how much i admire you debating skills i hope noting is taken personally as i am simply responding to the best responses of the pro side that happens to be from you i wish i had your writing and comprehension abilities it would help me greatly in my endeavours on wikipedia all the best my new friend hope to cross paths with you in a more productive project in the future 
 thank you very much and no i dont take it personally not at all just didnt agree cheers 
 if you have uploaded other unlicensed media please check whether they are used in any articles or not you can find a list of file pages you have edited by clicking on the 
 also as you might have noticed they are closing a bridge for N weeks so theres some routes on diversion and with temporary timetables i have used notes but in red to highlight this do you think its ok im happy to continue updating the page as you can probably guess from my user name i know the area well 
 i will be honest i didnt notice the three via points thing until last week by which point it was too late to be honest though living here i know the area so its incredibly hard to leave out via points that are equally important to others i had decided that as long as it fits in the column without starting a new line its ok to be honest most of the articles i have created were when i was inexperienced so they are not actually that good you are table skills are much better than mine i learnt how to fix the width of the columns from you the county route articles you have created are definitely the best looking of the lot im thinking of creating an isle of wight one on the same basis keep an eye on 
 ok thanks for that i will try and revise it soon should be easy i dont think they are all a result of me either which is good route N will be the challenge as even the routes of each operator vary 
 cheers im currently working through 
 additional i have just sorted out everton which was a nightmare might take a break from it for a bit so feel free to carry on from there 
 i have just removed the one from united i will sort out villa and start on the expremiership clubs thanks a lot for helping out 
 right i have sorted out villa and have got as far as ipswich town in the other clubs the expremiership clubs are trickier as some of their articles really do need a lot of cleanup not just what has added but other users additions too i didnt realise how badlymaintained some articles are 
 got up to norwich city but i have balked at nottingham forest the article is a total shambles and i havent the time to fix it if you want to give it a go feel free else skip it and we can leave it another time 
 thats all spi says provide diffs and links where the guy is editing yeah you already told me thats what you wanted but what are those specific diffs supposed to have evidence okay then what type of evidence 
 id suggest asking an 
 i was just looking at the template and was wondering if there is really a need for this template as there is also which could be used instead and also has more options 
 hi there no theres not really the optare one was created back in N when we were trying to sort out the optare bus articles to bring them all to the same acceptable standard the uk bus one was created afterward in N feel free to swap the infoboxes over and redirect the optare one to the uk bus one or whatever thanks for pointing this out i hadnt really noticed 
 thanks i have updated them all and redirected the template 
 excellent that brings them into line with the other manufacturers articles 
 hey hold on i am doing the best i can why do the temp pages have to be deleted they are in my userspace where i can work on them and improve them before they go back to the mainspace whoa please do not start deleting all the temp pages that is not fair 
 sorry i did not understand your point in that last comment could you try again sorry thanks 
 are you still reading books on the historical jesus i am curious to know about how your research is going in the meantime i came across which my be of interest to you it is written for a jewish audience in the spirit of ecumenacal understanding but in the process has lots of interesting views 
 i just noticed some references you have been adding to articles looks like you got some of the books we had discussed and you are putting them to use to boot thanks for your work 
 better late than never 
 thanks 
 many thanks for saving the article on accord plc from deletion i have now restored it to mainspace making clear why it is notable it was a leading highway maintenance business which employed over N people best regards 
 whoops i completely forgot to reply to this no worries im glad to see it has been reinstated i see you have added a new reference any chance you could add some more just to make sure it doesnt get proded again i did have a look on google but didnt find that much do you have any printed sources 
 good point i have added a little bit and will look out for more thanks 
 ah sorry i thought id said thanks for this but i obviously didnt anyway thanks for working on the article im pleased to see it back 
 cheers 
 ps might be another good place 
 the problem with the argentine copyright law is that we cant just get any image that has been published in argentina that we might find on the net but we must scan them ourselves from the original source since the scanning itself might be copyrighted i just came back form argentina were i could have searched for an old magazine or something we should ask 
 well it took three weeks but after i got round to uploading some more images 
 ah lovely thanks for those 
 and what do you know a new users written an article for 
 ooh thats good its a good article too needs a bit of work but a good start nonetheless 
 can you please have a look at the article and see if the cleanup tag can go now thanks 
 thank you 
 thank you 
 ignore this an ip removed it from the 
 ok thanks 
 thanks 
 jeremy i have sent you an email thanks 
 or styleverticalalign top bordertop N px solid gray or for swiftly and handily resolving 
 im going to have to start thinking creatively i can only give you so many of these truly thank you and i am very impressed 
 thank you very much i think it was my turn to give you a barnstar though 
 frankly much as i like your work here i find your signature a little distracting perhaps a somewhat smaller size would help so it doesnt make the line height change to accommodate it 
 whilst i dont want to butt in and cause an argument i thought i should say i have never had that problem on my screen the signature is the same height as other text and certainly doesnt push the line height up 
 you were right dgg that certinally was one hell of a frank message my signature incorporates superscript text in the same way that many many signatures seem to if you go looking now it wont take long to find plenty of others in fact when i first made this signature i based it on the sig of an admin who was also using superscript text the numbers used throughout articles to link down to the references also use superscript and change the line height but that doesnt seem to be a problem otherwise why would they be allowed on every single article nevertheless i have now amended my signature which should have fixed the problem as it doesnt change the line height has it at your end out of interest 
 hello i heard that you reviewed ga nominees if you have the time i would like you to start the review for 
 sorry i generally avoid englishspeaking politicians regards and mdash 
 thatuN s alright thanks anyway 
 politicians speak english news to me 
 i am too busy with work and stuff to go into details right now but you are quite mistaken in saying these are the only lists i have tagged i have previously tagged a good many and will no doubt tag more in future i have also put several lists of nonnotable bus routes up for deletion and some of them have been deleted 
 its still a hell of a coincidence which two articles you tagged at that time along with no others i have checked and you have tagged others but not the majority and they are all driveby taggings really i noticed some tags were different to others which i thought was good as it showed you were actually looking at each individual articles concerns that was until i found that youd put an original research tag on 
 thank you 
 what do you think should be done 
 i have 
 hi oldelpaso iam the person that submitted rugby union at pr your comments will be very helpful in the near future as i plan to work on it very soon thats why i wanted to ask you if you could take a look at another article on the pr which i submitted as well the 
 thanks for your comments i responded on the peer review page also i will make a good effort to play down its similarity to the fifa article and sorry about the edit summaries i will do it always from now on thanks again 
 hi glad to see you hacking on roman stuff my theory on 
 further to that if one thing is a subcategory of another then you dont need to link both categories like 
 your recent edit to 
 looks like the bot isnt perfect yet 
 lol 
 what is the projects thoughts on using user votes as part of the reception or is it better we just stick with professional reviews 
 we should definitely only use professional reviews 
 ok also 
 that article needs a lot more work i will work on it once we are done with sN 
 ok you N look like your doing fine on 
 yeah i think it should be enlarged too 
 agree 
 is 
 shouldnt that be a ga or an fa anyway it needs more inline sources 
 well on the 
 try asking scorpion 
 hi if you are very keen on creating a category for roman women at least make it a subcat on 
 i cleared up the doubled categories in the roman girls it was such a mess even 
 well i just thought that categorizing 
 my nomination is at 
 agreed i was just trying to prevent further discussion on the talk page about it apologies if it sounded harsh or as if i was attacking you that was not my intent 
 no worries 
 well done that was an article which needed to be written 
 thank you the anabasis is perhaps my favorite book of all time and im surprised that no one wrote an article for the ten thousand yet i will have to start making articles for the generals next 
 er yeah no real message here p 
 the best part of the story is that mel etitis was listed as a rouge admin 
 please cite your source because of todays current events some might view this addition as vandalism thanks 
 also if you do not cite sources to that addition people might view it as either a personal attack or pov 
 thank you for the nomination i have accepted it and its at 
 i was promoted yesterday with unanimous support that was impressive thanks again 
 they are also very useful when trying to review changes to an article over time thank you for your cooperation and mdash 
 i second third this request please include edit summarries it is very tiresome to other editors to have no indication of what an edit was about without doing a diff thank you very much 
 you dont have to i dont it will just add the section 
 thank you for blocking the edit warring ip that i reported unfortunately he is now continuing the edit war from a slightly different ip is there anything that can be done about the ip range or is requesting semiprotection for 
 the new ip is definitely 
 you deleted cited information from the saint paul page please dont delete cited information unless you take it up on the talk page as for the saint paul article theres a lot of uncited information there try deleting some of that 
 see 
 sorry i am kind of new around here thank you for your link to the info and for your understanding it will not happen again 
 as a side note could you check back with that page we are trying to get some sort of consensus going so we get this lame thing over with 
 how can i get the 
 hi the collaborations are transcluded to 
 negative i checked the latin 
 tx 
 for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria 
 i dont have a hatred of sa i have been reading and enjoying it for years however the point stands that noone seems prepared to show that the book has been covered in any nontrivial way by sources wholly independent to the site author publisher sellers etc its one thing to dance around and say there are sources its another to actually cite those sources i also did not delete the page i simply tagged it with a reason and whoever deleted it agreed with those reasons please take note of the 
 if 
 hes back again since i cant prove its not you you will probably want to report it at 
 ok thanks for pointing that out and telling me do you reckon it would be okay to have a link to it in a see also area in the article or shall i just leave it out completely 
 ok thanks anyway 
 any chance you can semi protect my userpage for N days i want to make sure you understand how to do it 
 i will do it then 
 yup you have got it now unprotect it 
 actually thinking about it id like to have move protection on indefinately 
 done unprotect next 
 passed with flying colours well done i know its hard at first but you will get the hang of it have you blocked anyone yet 
 yes two usernames i just asked riana a few minutes ago about a user i had blocked for their username as their name was the name of a website riana said i did the correct actions with that 
 hi ryan there should be a shortcourse training school for new admins on how to use the new tools are you interested in setting one up 
 that would be good unless one already exists and i have never heard about it it would help new administrators get more familar with the tools 
 my apologies i reverted the ip because i thought it was a vandal vandalizing your user page sorry about that 
 {{{icon or 
 i think getting an admin involved is an outstanding idea particularly given your unwililngness to assume good faith as i have with you do you want to start the N rd opinion or rfc process or shall i 
 hi try 
 is the lack of a response an indication you have reconsidered your position and dont see the need to consult anyone about this i notice you havent responded to me to ref who took a wholly independent interest or to the message i left in the article talk 
 perhaps because of your esl difficulties you continue to place inaccurate information in 
 i am asking you again if you understand the rules please take your dispute to the talk page 
 im back im back and hopefully here to stay now without anymore breaks thank you so much for taking care of the collaborationhow has it all been missed being here 
 thats a mighty impressive number this is really good things seem so different stranger anyways time to get back into the system 
 kind regards 
 thank you for stopping this guy 
 it was never my intention to vandalize please note that this page and this user is the only one where i had to ask again and again to maintain impartial nature but i am sad to see that the intentional edits by the anonymous user is not prevented and i am being crucified can you help can we have a third reviewer ( 
 replied on article talk 
 its wrong isnt it 
 sorry im not really interested in korearelated topics 
 thanks for clearing that up and sorry for wasting your time it still seems wrong to me though i guess the americans have it better after all 
 looks like qwghlm beat me to it i will second that barnstar as i was going to give you the exact same thing once the fapl article made fa status congrats on getting the man city article to the front page and thanks for all the hard work you did on the premier league article and that you continue to do through the football aid keep up the good work 
 i cant understand what could possibly be the justification for your early close of 
 i think it was an appropriate early close good move 
 hey mani found the problemyou had a ref list called entreaties which is the title to the star articlebut it was linked to the cbn articleso i just changed the ref list infoand its all straight now travisharger N N january N 
 just wanted to reiterate what someone else has commented previously for 
 hii had to remove the comicbook picture of flagg from his article im trying to get it to featured status and one of the problems people had was the abundance of decorative fair use if i brought it up to fa again they would probably bring up that picture sorry 
 the picture of king is licensed under the gfdl and is in the public domain anyone can use it if it was copyrighted since its of a living person it wouldnt be allowed on wikipedia at all 
 alright i added it back for now but id be surprised if the fair use inquisitors dont whine about it during the fa process 
 well i expanded the caption for the image to make it more related to the articles content 
 edit i managed to sort it but in a backwards way any advice would still be welcome 
 systematic addition of the same link to multiple articles tends to alert suspicions about the motive for adding links that in each case here two links to the same site were added increases suspicion some of the articles to which the links were added are clearly not directly related to the content of the site such as 
 i did this because N had passed and you usally do this by then sorry if you didnt want me to do this 
 i accept your nomination of me for adminship and will answer questions and add the subpage to the current requests section in a short while and ndash

 thanks for the welcome i have been editing a bit but im not really sure on the protocol for changing stuff any help would be much appreciated 
 my warning was in response to edit adding false information to 
 hey left do you want some help with your 
 sure im too busy to work on them right now 
 the preceding comment contained scenes of a violent or sexual nature and should not have been viewed by young children 
 i believe you have wrongfully nominated these articles for deletion 
 people like this are the scourge of the site 
 comment why must you nominate these articles without knowing anything about the articles in the first place you clearly have not got a clue thank you very much for making a nuisance of yourself 
 as you admit in your confessional area your football knowledge has more flaws than think i feel that your nomination of the 
 i will continue to keep an eye on the page as my time allows 
 fwiw i suspect that someuserN and 
 although elisson has given me some pointers you can go through the article if you want that would be very helpful cheers 
 the result of the 
 this suits me note that i am not the blocking admin however 
 hehe 
 hey i uploaded the arachnida edit over the original and tagged it for deletion per agreement with 
 ok i have replaced 
 this is a response that i received well you could do 
 sorry im not aware of a practical means of placing a link inside another link adding one would also be confusing for most readers nicknames should generally not have separate articles for example 
 based on what i had in my books plus a little extra googling i have created stubs at 
 no worries it was a pleasure beats reverting vandalism anyway oh and that mcfc stats site is a real horror what made them do it in flash 
 thanks for your contribution to the article i am about to add more biographical information about zimbabwe dance based on the record in oclc worldcat your information may open up a whole new area of literature on this subject does welshasante mention the ring shout in his text and if so does he also make a connection to dance forms in angola i know cultural traditions often cross national boundaries in africa 
 i probably had the same thought you did that being that the ring shout is an americanized version of african dances as described by welshasante the book was very specific to zimbabwe i looked a bit to find an drawing from early years to see if men and women were co mingled in the circle for instance but had no luck i have got a couple more books out and hope to find more glad to have you working on this hope you can find some good stuff 
 what if anything does welshasante say about the ring shout 
 hi kuralyov i noticed you have added several russian or soviet national elections to these pages usually national elections dont meet the notability requirements of these pages after all there a lot of countries out there and many of them have had a lot of elections throughout history adding them all would quickly overwhelm these pages 
 i should add that i have also reverted many other additions to doy as well as to years for the same reason as winstonN 
 thank you and best wishes 
 best regards 
 again best wishes on wikipedia 
 oh really cheers for letting me know will keep it in mind 
 thats very kind of you thanks very much 
 well i never knew that i dont suppose you have a reference for it do you 
 if you have any questions about the permission dont hesitate to ask otherwise happy editing 
 hi i removed it because according to your edit the only thing linked to the song is the character saying chickah chickah i understand the phrase chickah chickah is used in the song be yello but how can you prove that the character is in fact referencing the song im sure that phrase has been used elsewhere throughout history you have drawn a connection between the two things but since it does not at least to me appear overwhelmingly obvious that he is in fact referencing the song i believe this is your original research like you said the song isnt actually played in the episode (by the way do not use

 yeah everynow and then i get bored and search for a typo to fix i wasnt expecting to get so many hits off that one though anyway good job finding the last of them 
 we put things in wikipedia because of notability not for the hope that an page here will make them more notable 
 i see im also a fan of webcomics though i only really read N bit theatre it just seems that you have some kind of grudge or something the way so systematically nominate them

 i so admire your adoption of the drugrelated death page your hard work has provided the world with a unique longneeded list thank you 
 thanks a lot paul yes that page has been my magnum opus here on wiki it was taking so much research time my grades at uni started to drop while it was still being finished i found so much information i actually started writing a book on the subject but i have decided to wait until i finish studying before i put any real effort into it or finding references for the list of potential candidates i left on the articles talk page i hope you dont mind if i modify the award you have given me so that i can place it on my userpage with a link to the article cheers

 hello a short while ago you edited the article for the robert palmer album 
 i didnt state it charted at N i just corrected the formatting error before i got there it said #N and 
 most of the chart listing websites for the uk dont go above position N let alone N accordingly i cant find a reference for this if you challenge the information feel free to remove it i cant imagine where somebody would of found that it charted at N in the first place have a nice day 
 congratulations simon all the best 
 well played look forward to working with you 
 congrats 
 hi there i know this is late notice but i am just wondering if you are the user that has deleted the image that i uploaded on the page if this is so please refrain why you didnt just talk to me on my talk page instead of just going ahead and deleting the image wiki wont let me upload it again obviously please explain this to me 
 hi i did not delete the poster my full changes to the article can be seen checking the pages history it would seem 
 hi okay thank you for all of the info that you gave me i didnt know that he was an administrator and you are right since he is an administrator then he must know what he is doing thanks again 
 congrats from the nom i knew youd make it uN and nbsp 
 awesome good stuff and personal thanks to your contributions to the wiki world of football enjoy 
 if that link dosent work try 
 it helps if you explain your edits using the summary provided thats what its there for your change was unexplained and unreferenced hence the reversion considering the original statement is also unreferenced i dont have a problem with you changing it now that you have explained your edit as per my user page i currently do not have regular access to the internet so i may not be able to reply to further questions any time soon have a nice day 
 now afdd as prod nominators teddy comes hurtling out of the pram your input may be required one way or the other 
 to be honest with you i dont feel strongly about the article one way or the other i stumbled across it by bulk correcting typographical errors im staying neutral on this one 
 cheers 
 if any i think the last one the one of the mosh pit that is currently featured in the article is the most appropriate i dont think the current one that is there the example of a straight edge tattoo is a great choice as xxx is an ancronym for a lot of things and its fairly ordinary looking anyway the first tattoo is far too basic in my opinion and im pretty sure the fifth picture is in violation of wikis guidelines for advertising a website in the bottom right hand corner 
 you helped me back when i was a permabanned ip im legal now could you please get a stub started for this fellow 
 im not sure which part of creating the stub you are having trouble with so sorry if that was condescending let me know what you need to know or find me a couple sources and we will go from there 
 having a hard time finding the dates of life in an rs also i just wanted you to do it since you whipped out the gertrude and rvc stubs so fast 
 could you please semi protect the page for 
 ok no problem 
 thank you for your understanding and happy editing editing on behalf of 
 you are very welcome i was too young to remember the incident when it actually happened i first became aware of it about N years ago when my high school decided to perform the stage play blackrock i was shocked to not find an article already here on wikipedia so i took the liberty of writing it i have been extremely moved by the case i researched it so heavily and got so emotionally involved in it sometimes i actually felt like i knew her in a way i wish i had of she sounds like such a beautiful person i wish there was something more i could do i sure would have liked to give that man at the pub a piece of my mind anyway im glad you appreciate the article take care 
 please learn how to format references using as approved 
 i dont think this photo is in the public domain i have left notes on the photo page on commons and on the helen keller article here 
 the term of N years from creation refers to works that have not already become part of the public domain before the copyright act of N since the photo was not published it does seem unlikely to have become part of the public domain forgive my brazenness in assuming a work from N frickinN might no longer be protected by copyright 
 two people who know about previous laws claim that even though it was not published it in fact entered the public domain N years after creation under prior acts if they are right and i hope they are im glad to be wrong see 
 all i know is what the end result should be someone reading the second paragraph of the jesus article and understanding every word and nodding her head and thinkng yes this makes sense i am just not sure that the main articles on the historical xzjesus do this effectively it is time for a discussion and i think your two new sentences show that you have what it takes to lead such a discussion 
 wow thanks offhand i like the three articles but i would take cahbohj and change it to the intertestamental period or something make the article a subset of jewish history that includes jesus not an article about jesus 
 well its nothing i mean you deserve anything positive i may have said i am mostly reporting facts about the cahboj i can see your point we certainly need to improve all jewish history articles most of which are based on orthodox myth and not what any historin says i wonder how many jewish editors would object to a jewish history article featuring jesus analternative is an article on the jewish jesus but i dnot like the way that suggests other articles are not on the jewish jesus ie that jesus was not jewish i think we just need to think about these things we have three articles that are clearly realated but in hindsight is this really how we would have organized them 
 when you have time can you add citations to the second paragraqph of the jesus article specifically to the two sentences you wrote but which i copied and pasted into the article thanks 
 i removed it because there was no cited reference for the interpretation and because interpreting the quote didnt add anything encyclopedic to the article 
 not to worry can you give me half an hour to fix up the references and some other bits and bobs then you are free to edit as you please ta 
 ok done i dont think i undid any of your edits in the process but if i did then apologies i should have stuck up an inuse notice from the start of my tinkering im happy with the state of the article as it is now so feel free to cast your eye over it again and make any more corrections 
 out of curiousity i was looking for the very first article created through 
 think i found it 
 you gonna tell me he or she or it is a physician or a medical doctor or a phd in something there is nothing in the text of the article that says anything about early life profession at all 
 its ok it was a pop culture joke p pauline pantsdown was simply a it lecturer who cut up the words of pauline hanson and rearranged them to make her sound like a blithering idiot and then released them as pop singles one of the lines in one of the songs was why cant my blood be coloured white i should speak to some medical doctors coloured blood its just not right 
 if you are miffed that i reversed your tag removal you have my apologies at any rate enjoy the day or evening 
 thanks sharing your thoughts and i completely understand your feelings actually i somewhat agree with the majority of your comments alright maybe N per cent i see what you mean about feeling as if you are being told to fix the article it may be construed by some as adding hierarchy but it is not my intent like i said they are as much for me as others i will probably be more cautious about setting tags for minor problems ok i will at least try thanks again for sharing your thoughts and may i say it is always a pleasure having an intelligent exchange of ideas my best to you 
 stop spamming user talk pages with this censorship stuff you get blocked for disruption 
 your proposal that wikipedia allow sexual depiction of minors if obviously impractical since doing so will allow wikipedia to be prosecuted in the us and closed down please think a little 
 im not spamming user pages and the policy explicitly forbids anything against us law so both of these claims are baseless i have not violated any wikipedia policies so i do not see how i can get blocked 
 just saw that 
 well i dont think i meet notability standards even for bhamwiki but im pretty sure the njn does for general wikipedia since pretty much every other generalcirculation newspaper in alabama is listed there (yeah i know 
 hi there this might sound odd but since you have already been in contact with tulane to get 
 hi again i think its still important to include the tu bit because tulane does have a trademark on it per and its clearly marked on the shield logo (its therefore a valid acronym no matter what the ip editor says its pretty clear the individual has a big pov axe to grind and doesnt care about 
 hi and good to meet you i read your comments on the birmingham campaign page involved in the james bevel discussion and your user page says you put attention on birmingham data there was an activist not much is written about on wikipedia lola hendricks who was i believe the secretary of shuttlesworths group and was active in the N effort a friend and i stayed at her home in N at the N th anniversary and shes since died but she would be someone who is article worthy if focused upon her daughter is probably still alive and was one of the students in the childrens crusade just an idea for a future page if there is either a birmingham wikigroup or if we get the civil rights movement wikigroup organized thanks 
 sad news about audrey i didnt remember her name but she was the daughter i met and interviewed along with lola in N and you are fast with the articles cant help much on this one but the people at the museum in birmingham should have reference data on her or some of the students who took part her death the only word i had was i had asked someone there how lola was and they said she had died this was a few years ago hope its not true but she was up there in age keep me informed if you would thanks 
 just clicked on your story jeez you are fast what a good piece to whip together i only glanced at it and will go back and your article reminded me that there is another article which badly needs writing for wiki the group she and shuttlesworth were members of that may be the only major civil rights movement group which doesnt have a wiki article as yet thats one along with lola hendricks which should go onto the 
 and now read your wikipedia article on hendricks very nice and full of information i didnt know about her it would be nice if she was still alive and could read it i put a few edits in for you to look at added and early life section and put the template on would you do the honor of creating the alabama christian movement for human rights page even as a stub for now as mentioned that might be the last major organization without a wikipedia article thanks again and again nice work im still sorry about audreys death and i forgot that she was in jail for so long 
 a start its turning into a very good article will get back to it tomorrow i just saw it and dexter and curb your enthusiasm will gather my attention in about five minutes but your article looks great you even put in a picture of the badge more tomorrow 
 read it again and learned many things i didnt know only a couple of suggestions as im most conversant with the N campaign in reference to the article maybe when the invite is mentioned an sclc cofounding credit can be given shuttlesworth king and abernathy which as i understand it was the reason sclc went to birmingham shuttlesworth asked and sclc went because of the cofounding background and in the strategy section the wyatt walker mention please consider adding the word early plans as when those plans didnt work and even king getting arrested didnt gain very many more demonstrators bevel then initiated and developed the childrens crusade and his plan to march to washington which when combined gained the birmingham success for the movement and for the nations history and led directly to the civil rights act glad you put lola hendricks into the article you have expanded the history of the birmingham movement on wikipedia considerably with the two pages and possibly some of this data can be included in the main birmingham campaign article as well i hope shuttlesworth survives until the N th anniversary but either way his legacy will be present there he really didnt like abernathy after N an interesting side story that you touched on briefly thanks again 
 hi and hope all is well do you have a timetable for when you are going to put the acmhu page on wikipedia it seems in good shape and your related article on their declareation of principles was very interesting and information new to me nice work yet again 
 sounds good i had no idea the group may still be operating good luck with the further research and hopefully some more interesting discoveries 
 thanks the new page looks good too a person unknown to most not familiar with movement data will look further at the article this weekend as a side topic at a quick glance i realized id never looked at the ad king article on wikipedia did so and added his page to the template and the template to the page his page gets quite a lot of hits everyday yes something did happen between mainly shuttlesworth and abernathy i dont know what but the movement didnt really last long after birmingham king bevel and the others wrapped up voting and open housing within three years then onto antiwar and then it was over just learned brad pitts production company is going to do a selma movie seems to be written already and pretty much set to go wonder if angelina will have a role 
 lee daniels to direct i didnt know that thanks hes new york based while pitts production company is in the uk with the spielberg film the hbo series planned on branchs work and this selma movie the civil rights movement seems to be having another goaround with a younger generation working on portraying it on the big and small screens an important reason seems to me for wikipedia to get it right and yes maybe pitt and jolie can pair up as mr and mrs wallace 
 a very good article thanks for letting me see its creation noticed you included the declaration of principles within it and not as a separate page as well as leaving unlinked wiki links to smith and gardner to be ah linked in the near future nice work all around i put in a few edits please have a look and it seems some of the data on these new pages and on lola hendricks can easily flow into the main birmingham campaign article these pages really fill a hole in wikipedia coverage of the era 
 regarding the prose if you feel that there are any other specific areas that need better explanation maybe you could point them out or take the editing into your own hands if you so wish sometimes it can be hard to spot areas which a newcomer to the topic would find difficult to comprehend when you know the topic pretty much insideout yourself and would take some of it for granted cheers 
 i think it is generally accepted the the worst of the 
 i think it might be worth keeping the mention of aston villa in the jersey section it explains why the colours of claret and blue in particular were first chosen 
 well it got there at last i just wanted to say thanks very much for all the continuous help and advice you gave cheers 
 perhaps the politicians formerly known as conservatives 
 when the modern american conservative movement was launched in the N s they created historical narratives to show that they belonged in the american political tradition just as the left had done earlier eg the 
 i was actually trying to inject a little humor 
 hi i just wanted to clarify an that you on the 
 thanks for calling me out on this that was definitely not vandalism as you noted i should have used a much different edit summary but i either forgot or didnt take the time to do so in the tool that i was using i will try to be more careful about this in the future 
 hi id like to help you with the image you just uploaded to the 
 i see i have changed the licensing from free use to fair use as there is no evidence that it was ever under crown copyright which specifically only applies to works created by employees of the british government this picture could have been taken by anyone and the national maritime museums collection includes works not in the public domain its better to assume that the picture is still copyrighted which would be the standard life of the author plus N years but we can make a reasonable claim of fair use in this instance i think 
 i have some stats and career history for him if you like 
 i have added some international stats now 
 nice work congrats i just ran across the article 
 hi and merry christmas and other celebrations i have noticed that the lola hendricks page has gotten a steady stream of viewers since you put it up as probably have the other related pages again very nice work 
 thanks 
 no archives rats looking at the latest episode i seize on the words anorexic disorder and search the history to see when it first showed up is a strong indication of infringement it was all added by one person during roughly one time frame the content did not change so thats no help but if these summaries had been added over weeks or months they would more likely have evolved naturally 
 thank you all for your comments and thanks to theleftorium for the link for spotting possible violations i didnt mean to make this question any additional work for anyone sorry theleftoriumto me you are an experienced editor eta funny thing moonriddengirl you found that out in a much better manner than i did very good catch thank you all 
 theleftorium is a very experienced editor d just to be clear even if they did write it we need them to verify that which is difficult with sites like tvcom if content is previously published elsewhere we cant import it under our 
 oh ps i did notice you have been doing a good job of watching out for copyvios there appreciated 
 well i thought i was doing a good job but i missed the readd i could have sworn id stripped that page already silly meim always learning thanks though 
 you have been blocked for N hours for disruption the spamming of user talk pages i also left a note at 
 you should have warned him first maybe he was not even aware of the rule this is uncivil 
 yes a warning should have been issued first i for one am very thankful of the message this user left me concerning the 
 feel free to look a teeny bit up the talk page you might noticed that he was in fact warned 
 i have not violated any wikipedia policy or even guideline in fact my actions are permited by the wikipedia policy on spamming keane has blocked me for his personal reasons and not from the blocking policy i believe it was a good faith mistake on the par of keane and he assumed policies which were not actualy there but it seems nobody is taking the trouble to unblock me i have already emailed keane and the mailing list im losing valuable time here unable to edit wikipedia if someone else thinks i did not do anything wrong would that person please unblock me or request an admin to unblock me thank you 
 please see 
 that discussion also seems to indicate that some editors think the block is unwarranted and i was not commiting any disruption wikipedia policies and a sense of what is best for the encyclopaedia allow me to do this and nothing prohibits me except the personal taste of some sysops 
 thanks will pass as soon as required N hour hold period expires 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised removing will stop the 
 proposed deletion for lack of notability sad and ndash 
 would you be interested in passing comment 
 i know you are away or maybe disinterested but i would appreciate any feedback you may have to give 
 i would place a warning per wpciv on his page but he seems to have many friends in decently high places should i just write him off as a bully should i make an issue of how personally vicious he is im unsure how to proceed please advise 
 hmmm i would not want to be in your or ksbs shoes right now might i suggest a different tactic delete any trace of him from your talk page completely if he posts there again just delete it completely without an edit summary you will get your point across and he will quit its still not civil but its preferable to the situation yall have now and maybe wait a couple of weeks before you flaunt that quote uN 
 hey oldelpaso just thought id let you know that i will be reviewing pd for ga as part of the gac drive while hes incredibly frustrating to watch i remember him scoring for city in the playoff final and remain impressed by his tenacity but anyhow i will let you know what i think my comments will no doubt have a slight 
 hes on hold but the comments are minor so let me know when you have attended to them and i will review for a pass cheers 
 hey mattythewhite attended to the issues i raised so all good you have a ga good work 
 or 
 if you have any questions about the permission dont hesitate to ask otherwise happy editing 
 thank you for adding coordinates to the 
 same deal with 
 hi thanks im struggling with the afd process i think i just havent followed the steps meticulously enough the page in reference is 
 ok it should be fixed now cheers 
 thanks a lot 
 i reverted your coordinate addition for the 
 thanks for that not sure how i screwed that up so much thanks for the N nd chance 
 third chance coming up those last coords put it north west of spain maybe we could rename the page george davis boathouse 
 sloppy editing on my part wow sorry about that 
 much better 
 thanks for moving that back i didnt realise you were an administrator you saved us a lot of work going through the 
 as an aside you couldnt pass judgement on the list could you need as many comments as possible given your experience your opinions would be welome on the 
 an editor has asked for a discussion to address the redirect 
 update an editor objected at the rfd so i have afded 
 hi there i noticed you added the 
 fair enough its due a place then 
 happy to help regards 
 do you think you could wave your articleprotection wand when you get a chance its been a good time there today 
 muchos gracias it will likely die down if celtic go ahead of them in the table 
 by the way shouldnt the padlock symbol appear on the page 
 forgetting to remove it isnt necessarily a bad thing if it deters vandals who notice it 
 if you dont have time to add the right coordinates to their wiki articles then i thank you in advance regards 
 thank you for your kind help cheers 
 your note wasnt signed so i can only respond here if you cant find more information there isnt much you can do be content that the article is in reasonably good shape and keep an eye on it to ensure that it stays that way 
 oops still trying to get a hang of this thanks for the reply lyckankommer N N april N 
 this article is now a 
 blast you ( 
 the first N schools are all in my municipality or city of surrey whereas the last one is a fairly important school in the neighbouring city of delta thank you for all your help ihope you like the pictures with best regards from surrey bc 
 dear pkt i notice that you have not responded to my final message above i hope i have not taken too much time with this request as it is my final request i usually try to take N picturesonly of high schools which i consider notableif this is feasible but a coordinate is helpful for a schools wiki article if you are unable or time constrained to help here for these N schools that is quite fine but please let me know as a courtesy personally i dont know where you find these coordinates but other people seem to thank you 
 thanks for your reply i certainly respect your reasons as i said personally i dont know where people seem to find the coordinates for schools places and cities like this one in cairo egypt which is the only image i sourced that is a valued image the admin on commons asked me to addd the coordinates and when i said i hadnt a clue he said no problem hed add it himself its the only copyright free photo for this egyptian ruler i got another image licensed freely too for N other but i never did make a vi request no time like you sadly cheers 
 thank you i will try it out soon with kind regards ps there are only N intact funerary masks of pharaohs other than tutankhamun and is the last one all the tombs of the other egyptian kings masks were looted in antiquity sadly 
 as always your comments are greatly appreciated im off on holiday imminently so i may not have time to attend to all of them before monday but please dont take inactivity as a sign of ingratitude all the best 
 i have made a start i need to get my book and hope you could help with kuper otherwise its bedtime goodnight and thanks again 
 hey still trying to think of a way of wedging this in my book said he had a one year deal at psv anyway he did say qualification on the last day was a miracle but doesnt expand on it not sure what i can add to the article here any ideas 
 ok so it looks like im close to satisfying your concern let me know if theres anything else in the article that needs work i really appreciate your efforts so far 
 what have i done wrong just curious i notice in other schools there are usually N direction coordinates thank you 
 thank you that was quite a very new school actually i will try an older school and see the resoluts cheers 
 hey could you block 
 nevermind its been blocked anyway cheers 
 exactly i wanted to get the page on on the N st which would have been even worse more transfers of course as its deadline day which leads to more people going on wikipdia who therefore see york city and maybe decided to attempt to ruin it well thats how i figured it out anyway 
 hello pkt i have added some references which might address the concerns you expressed at this afd thanks 
 it seems to be well covered but i will watch it as well 
 hey dude just about to start reviewing fowler but noticed something possibly dodgy the image in the infobox is licensed under creative commons N but when i checked the original in flickr it disallowed derivative works so i think the image needs to be removed im no image expert but wikipedia needs to be safe rather than sorry perhaps you could look into it further to spare blushes 
 slight oversight on my part when uploading the image i have emailed the images creator so hopefully he will relicense it under creative commons N 
 hi i was wondering would you be interested in running for adminship id be happy to nominate you or if you prefer a more highprofile nominator simply offer my strong support as you know 
 hi jafeluv thank you for the offer two other great editors have already offered to nominate me so i think they are before you in the line i have told them that id like to wait a little longer with the rfa until im not too busy with school i have a holiday between march N and april N so i might be able to squeeze it in there if ceranthor and moonriddengirl are available cheers 
 oh you had someone lined up already i will look forward to supporting you then 
 dear me tl i was passing by to catch up on some discussions noticed this and can only say yes finally i expected this six months ago uN 
 hi cactuswriter long time no see if everything goes as planned the rfa will be up sometime next weekend im happy to have your support 
 i have replied to your thoughtful comment i appreciate your input i could be off the mark here but i do genuinely believe this is notable nb terriersfan and i have just done some considerable improvement work to the article 
 have you had a chance to review it there was quite a bit of work done yesterday 
 fair enough thanks for responding 
 thanks in advance 
 thanks for your help and feedback 
 hey thanks for letting me know about the image yes the flickr licence now is wholly appropriate for the way in which the image is being used i will do my best to get the article reviewed in the next couple of days any idea how i can get some more interest in the bobby robson fac cheers 
 hey funnily enough some nine hours after i wrote that it was promoted hurrah and thanks for your support i will get on with robbie and will hopefully be able to review scotlands fac now im not stressing about robson cheers again 
 step one done i have had a first review of scotland and made some comments fowler next 
 fowler done fail im afraid but i have made extensive comments on the talk page let me know if you think i have been too hard or if youd like any more advice or help etc 
 hello it seems beyond me why you would revert at least one of my last two edits first of all it is true that rugrats may be surpassed by spongebob (or is such an edit against 
 its an animated tv series that isnt being made anymore 
 but still like you just said it is an animated tv series although one that isnt being made anymore that sort of kills the purpose of was and as i recall there has been an ongoing debate about whether to use is or was for things not in use or production anymore and im pretty sure is won out should we perhaps rephrase the opening statement or what 
 i dont care just dont make a contentious edit at the same time 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or for constantly leaving meaningful and wellthoughtout posts on practically every discussion page keep it up uN 
 not sure what prompted that but thank you i appreciate the gesture 
 im trying to make a habit out of thanking the terribly underappreciated members of the community as insignificant is it may seem i think barnstars go a long way in encouraging editors uN 
 any chance you could find out if he played for man city my book source says that after he left blackpool he later played for manchester city and porto but neither of the online databases i have consulted mention city 
 great thanks roy calley seems to be inaccurate more often than id like 
 hi there i noticed you were a member of 
 i cleaned up this article a bit since you rated it start class yesterday i was wondering if it should be upgraded to b or not im unable to get a lot of information on sullivan so theres not much more i can add 
 i was forgetting there was c class theres probably a bit more i can do to improve it possibly adding in all the posts he held while in opposition i have been looking for stub or start articles lately to improve and this was one of them any tips you could give me would be great though its not that easy to get information on him 
 thanks for the feedback i have done my best to address all the issues raised 
 ok i have addressed to most of the pionts raised and i have replied to all the rest 
 hey dude can you spare ten minutes and criticise or support or oppose 
 ps well done on scotland fa i only just noticed 
 cool thanks for your comments i have hopefully addressed them 
 thank you very much for your quick assistance with my helpme i understand better now the implications of the blocking of sensitive ip addresses 
 i am not familiar with 
 oldelpaso villa park has just had a pr and i have put it up for ga i was wondering could you review it for me seen as coms is fa and i guess you did most of that well good luck today come on villa 
 rumour is little johns out which i think is a blessing watch out for ashley young our best player keep him quiet you will win thanks and have a good time todaybut not too good 
 thats fine just need a list of what needs doing so i can do it good luck today 
 hey hope things are fine just made the changes you suggested for villa park but could you sort out the redirect for me or tell me how please thanks again 
 thanks guysbut i am on a lot of enemies lists right now i am pretty angry about this website 
 been there believe me but dont abandon the asylum to the lunatics 
 i am beginning to think that this website is dominated by anarchists and morons not serious contributors to the effort of writng an encyclopedia my desire to edit this website is really low at this pointall i feel like doing is tracking down all the socks and banned editors and getting then blocked 
 i have been wondering about applying to the august body myself perhaps we should coordinate cos i think either of us would be equally controversial and we havent seen much of that since gracenotes i understand your not liking wikipedia that much youd get my vote based on your contribs right now anyway fwiw 
 i dont know how to say this but your wikiwings award had really touched and humbled me i feel really acknowledged which makes my experience on wikipedia much more enjoyable thank you ahunt i plan to finish the article off by tomorrow and nominate it for ga so watchout on a slightly different note have you ever heard of a sukhoi or mikoyan before well i will be working on the 
 thanks for your note glad you thought that small acknowledgement of your work was a positive thing you did some good work there and i believe in credit where credit is due a lot of people put in hundreds of hours of work on wikipedia each month for no pay and very often for no thanks either we really are building a great encyclopedia and the work being done needs to at least be acknowledged 
 i hope this is the start of a great partnership 
 if substantial content is duplicated and it is not 
 reviewed the page cited contains virtually no text so obviously a bot error 
 this is definitely a needed article good work i have looked it over and made a couple of small changes otherwise it looks great i will make some link as to it as it is referred to in many articles we need a photo of the trophy 
 the only sort of picture i have ever been able to find of the trophy is here http or or soaringweborg or awards or barringerhtml i may try to email the latest winner to see if he could take a picture 
 if you could get him to do that it would be a real coupe it would be ideal if he would upload the photo to commons but if he sends it to you with permission to post it that would do 
 so 
 thanks i went round and fixed the double redirects before you did the move i fixed one on the talk pages just now though do the talk pages need to exist though they are simply redirecting to a different talk page do we need to preserve the edit history for talk pages as well as articles do talk pages come under the gfdl in the same way as articles thanks again 
 hi i notice you have the logo i cropped from a freetouse image i dont wish to get into the rightsandwrongs but will just note that i was copying the example set by so many userboxes eg 
 hi there thanks for your note i am not trying to be difficult and i am certainly not a trademark lawyer but i have run afoul of copyrighted logos used in articles myself as far as i know those other logos are also copyright violations and should be tagged my understanding of us copyright law is that a photograph of a three dimensional object such as a camera body that only coincidentally has a copyrighted logo on it and where the logo is not the focus of the picture can be released as a free image under a cc licence but a photo that predominantly shows the logo is in fact a reproduction of the logo and thus copyrighted cannot be anything other than a copyrighted image and thus can only be used under the fair use provisions of us law which according to wikipedia excludes use in userboxes in nominating the image for review by a copyright specialist admin i was planning to see what they had to say and if they agree and remove it then i will nominate the rest of the closeup images of copyrighted camera manufacturer logos that have been released under free licences for userboxes as well i would suggest we wait and see what the admin says but you can go ahead and replace the image with lettering instead if you prefer 
 it looks like the 
 okay and thanks for looking into this if i can use the 
 that makes sense to me as you can tell i am still learning us copyright law here myself 
 i donuN t know if youuN re aware but 
 yes but even before i changed the date the infobox showed the date as the N st april and since id been on johnleechorguk i thought a typo error had occured in the text so i corrected it 
 okay thanks nice use of phrase there 
 thanks for letting me know about 
 i agree no one knows what happens when they dont leave a message on wikipedia i spent N weeks in the philippines and i kept in touch with some of the people on wikipedia that i work on articles with now im back would like to get things going again 
 thanks for the message and for thinking i merit it give me a couple of weeks to think about it though as i have got an interview coming up for a new job which if i got it would dramatically reduce the amount of time id be on wp so it would seem a bit redundant being an admin if i was only on occasionally but if i foost up the interview id certainly be interested 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or awarded for the creation of a large number of high quality glider type articles amazed that nobody else has noticed the effort cheers 
 well thank you kindly one reason that i have had obscure gliders of the N s to N s all to myself is that i dont think many people have paid much attention to them even after they were created still a few to go yet though i am doing a methodical sweep 
 i was just on my way with a barnstar with exactly the same reasoning to find myself pipped anyway well done and keep going gliders have been a bit neglected what is the state of the glider project looked very neglected last time i was there 
 thank you for your kind thoughts the gliding project seems to be a bit disused right now but there are a few of us doing the writing anyway 
 ah thanks for pointing that out might save a bit of time lol 
 for absolutely no reason whatsoever i went to your confessional page and having a little chuckle at them all then saw the bottom one and everything made sense 
 hello i notice that you transplanted material from the temporarily deleted article 
 do please let me know if i havent explained this well enough 
 no problem im happy to help 
 would you be interested to do a more indepth article on diamond aircraft based on more background information 
 thanks for your note if more references can be found on the companys history then sure the article can be expanded right now the less recent history is missing and needs expansion 
 thanks for your response i can definitely help with the less recent history i could write something myself but i do not have the time available and you have a good grip on this stuff can you shoot me an email though my user page thanks 
 ok 
 evening ahunt are you sure the designers name was radburn it did occur to me that it ought to be in order to make sense of the broburn but flight have him as radbarn do we trust the museum site thanks for adding the museum ref didnt know about that its not in wrN under broburn bus as wanderlust cheers 
 thanks for your note it wasnt me that that was 
 thanks for that i will maybe drop him a query certainly wouldnt be the first time flight got a name wrong but i guess they are the only citeable source
 re rv of my rm of aircraft lists template at 
 that is for aircraft types but by general consensus we use this navbox on all aircraft related articles as a general aid to readers finding key aviation articles it is used on pretty much all aviationrelated articles as indicated at 
 thanks fyi many articles on components or systems dont have that template eg 
 obviously an oversight it has one real advantage in that when it is matched with another navbox that is similarly configured that both will collapse this taking up much less room on the page 
 what do you think about the second paragraph in the premier league problems section i am thinking it should be deleted as 
 yep glad you got what i meant i agree with your suggestions i will have a look for a reference on the overall expenditure and will remove the second para of big N i will think about a new title critcisms of premier league i had a look at the old version before i started editing today much like you must have done when cleaning up the history section 
 hello ahunt we are working together on the article i found this from msnbc which shows the downed aircraft just yards passed the runway the tail wings are basically resting atop the perimeter fence with the section between tail wings and main wings resting on the socalled road past the fence this contradicts some of the press reports joerg the 
 lets take this to 
 your attempt to archive the discussion misrepresents other editors in violation of wptalk and wpcon i have reverted it 
 i have changed the summary to no consensus i hope that represents the situation accurately and neutrally 
 i do not agree with your assessment ronz i merely point out that even if there is no consensus and you believe so you should restore the comments 
 expect to see a wqa on this ronz i dont have time to attend to it this second but your disruptive antics need to stop cheers 
 thanks for not wording it as a threat this time 
 that is not a threat ronz it is a promise if anything it will give you more time to prepare your answer im sick of your unilateral moves gaming and policy violations im not threatening to report them im telling you now that i plan to report them cheers 
 in order for it to be a threat it would have to be an attempt to coerce you to do something i want you to that is not the case informing you in advance that i plan to do something irrespective of what you do is not a threat it is simply forewarning but your attempt to construe it as a threat is just more of the same gaming you like to engage in cheers 
 i wont be preparing anything i think the comments on your talk page are enough 
 ronz just like on the various noticeboards you cant simply assert that something is the case without some evidence i have done nothing like what is described in your quoted policy text N threating you with admins i know negative N threatening to have you banned negative in fact as i have pointed out i have not threatened anything at all please familiarize yourself with what a 
 thanks for responding the quote from wptalk gives multiple examples including how to properly handle the situation in comparing your comments to the quote i agree your comments could have been worse they appear to be more like the examples of what not to do rather than what to do hence my bringing it up at and then quoting it above 
 in case i dont get round to a prod have you seen 
 thanks for your note i havent seen it let me have a look and see what needs to be done there 
 an admin has blocked him indefinitely for spamming so it seems a nobrainer to nominate the article for csd which i have done perhaps you would like to do the honours and review my nomination 
 and it is gone 
 thanks for that and sorry just to leave you a note and run i had a real life diversion and would have probably forgotten about 
 no problem i was happy to help out and that was an easy one 
 fancy spending a few moments at the peer review for this i really value your comments and im aiming to get this to 
 well i have gone and 
 thanks for your comments 
 well welcome to wikipedia sure if i can help you out getting started i would be happy to do that let me know if you have any specific questions as far as 
 so update on what needs to be done the transfer records needs to be prosified and referenced do we really need to mention all of the records given that we already have 
 hi i would greatly appreciate it if you could try leaving some comments on 
 i have done the rambling mans comments and i would love to recieve some morethanks 
 i suddenly noticed this has been sitting around doing nothing at 
 well i will review it anyhow and we will see where we need to go deal 
 done comments await you 
 phenomenal oggie i will allow the text no stress about getting it done just as long as you can allow me to finish the review before i sod off to laos this time next week 
 done and dusted well done great work 
 or 
 actually this might not be your fault if you took it out of 
 done 
 hi rick i know its not required by policy but would you please review 
 i usually indent but sometimes slip thanks for the heads up 
 dont know if you watchlist pages you have posted to or whether you prefer talkbacks but heres one 
 i am willing to answer questions 
 thank you for the interest i would like to send the questions to your email is it possible you can send your contact to my email go to my userpage and click on toolbox > email this user 
 the N th isnt scheduled to change missions until this summer just a bit premature there although they have already turned over the air sovereignty mission to the oaklahoma guard 
 i believe the standdown and standup ceremonies are scheduled for the june drill weekend 
 tasmac is not a liquor manufacturer it buys liquor wholesale from breweries so i dont think it can be categorized as a brewery 
 alcohol in india is fine 
 currently 
 i do not see where in the vandalism policy is an explicit condemnation of removal of talk page content the discussion removed is no longer an issue it makes little sense to retain discussions which have been settled 
 then i will delete my comments 
 this message was placed automatically and it is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists if that is the case you can remove the tag from the article and it would be appreciated if you could drop a note on 
 ditto for categorycolleges in india you emptied the entire category but did not delete the page wondering where i went wrong with this thank you 
 any and all help would be greatly appreciated either in the form of peer review or in direct edits i am still learning my way around wikipedia and what constitues what i have no ownership issues just want to add value so no stepping on toes problems there 
 thanks for all your help with this i have left some questions or comments on nerys talk page regarding most of the outstanding items on your list of peer review type comments i would value your input thanks again 
 thanks for your cogent comments at this afd i know we cant canvass but if you know how to have this afd listed at various forums please do that i have no idea how to accomplish that as i wrote i have some problems with the structure and format of the list but am more than willing to fix it up a bit i tend to be passionate about standardizing lists of notable people dont know why im drawn to them i image all of us that edit a lot on wp have some obsessive compulsive tendencies 
 i am really annoyed with the decision to delete this page as you may imagine i dont think any of the blp issues were unfixable i really dont understand why people think that labelling someone a muslim without sources is slander its like when a woman called barack obama a muslim and john mccain defended him but made it sound like if he was a muslim it would have been a bad thing im not going to protest its deletion but i just find it weird that we delete this one but dont delete other lists just like it with equal passion thanks for your support you do probably know that there are ways to request admin oversight on deletion reviews right if you decide to do so let me know and i will participate and i still want to know in india is it patently obvious to most people when someone is a muslim by their name or even their ethnicity or some other matter thus do people not bother to comment on it so much 
 thanks for your personal take on my question i believe you i agree there was no consensus in this afd and i think the existence of so many similar articles means it would be better to open up a dialoge i think its a request for comment somewhere again if you ever want to try to do so notify me and i will participate 
 well done on saving another article from the clutches of relegation 
 yeah just noticed that too excellent work 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or for singlehandedly categorising all 
 you are welcome 
 all of this of course amounts to one of the reasons why wikipedia prefers to work with images that are unencumbered if at all possible cheers 
 on further reflection i think this image fails the replacability test in that anyone with the time and skills to do their own computer render of the aircraft could do so theres nothing unique about boeings render that makes it imperative that we use theirs you are of course free to disagree and argue the point along the lines i suggested above 
 i have an issue with an anonymous user regarding the deletion proposals of two article 
 thank you for your help on this i have also followed up with a report on abusive user isps because this user regarding both 
 if you look at the past histories of the article especially with the afd for siobhxeN n you will see some of the user ips labels as single purpose accounts the whois states that they are all from ireland 
 the 
 i have adapted the text i wrote for my category and copied it to yours i hope it seems helpful 
 i was in two minds about the name of the category i checked names of the other countries i noted american photography and british photography and like so i went with precedent and named it indian photography i prefer photography in india and am okay if anyone changes it to that 
 theres this contributor whos english is so bad and whos regard for facts is so careless that i would like to have their ip address blocked at the least i would like someone in authority to talk to them i do not like to call this person a vandal because their intentions are honorable and their postings do not demean people this person edits the article history of portugal they like to post in flurries of brief edits and they are unregistered i have already reverted their first flurry and justified myself in the articles discussion page what do you suggest i do now thanks 
 hi discussion is mostly the best way to resolve disagreements over editing in this case it may be difficult to get in contact with the editor in question as he or she is editing anonymously but 
 i have populated 
 thanks 
 hi 
 you are welcome good luck 
 hey oldelpaso thanks for your comment im not that tempted about transfer fees since unless you get access to the club financial records all reported transfer fees are very dubious for example itfc bought 
 oh and good work on 
 ok point taken about the square corner version for future reference its important to link to exactly where you took the photo from it still doesnt get us out of the problem of it being a replacable image though 
 the matter is slightly more complicated because boeing says they have no problem with their gallery images being used by others for purely informational purposes however this is contrary to wikipedias mission to create a truly free encyclopedia to achieve this all of the content we provide needs to be reusable by anyone for any purpose by uploading a photo here we are effectively saying to the world come and get it and do what you like with it this includes modifying the photo or using it for commercial purposes if someone wanted to upload a photo here that they took themselves but put conditions on it like use it on wikipedia but noones allowed to crop it or use it to make money we couldnt and wouldnt accept their conditions and we wont accept those sorts of conditions from boeing either if someone wants to download a photo from wikipedia to print on a tshirt and sell at airshows they need to have that right thats one of the things that makes wikipedia so revolutionary 
 a review would be good thankyou i am away from my books at the moment so cant really respond if my memory serves me correctly he was asked to leave by resignation as i say wont have sources until tommorrow so we will see what mine say and what yours say thanks 
 right the says he retired my dean hayes book says he suffered a stroke due to overwork and had to retire the ward or griffin book talks about it in two places and in N he left the club in the text it states in july N he resigned on grouns of ill health the pretext to that statement though is that he was under a lot of fan pressure so i have shown you mine 
 i have done those prose fixes thanks 
 on a somewhat related note i would really appreciate it if you could take a look at 
 your recent edit to 
 above is a false warning 
 it would be good to have some definition for 
 the definition is already there in the parent 
 hmm while im not happy with that periodisation thats probably a matter for historians i have edited the category page to include the definition uN its always useful to add this so that others know what pages or subcategories can be added to that category regards 
 im not sure what you are doing but the recent ips edits are fine 
 yep as i realised after reverting its the not using an edit summary thats a pita 
 i have just given a N rr warning william could you help i notice that she reverted an edit of mine with an edit summary calling it vandalism 
 sorry some confusion about the edits it was another edit katherine has reverted her now 
 shes ignored my warning and i cant revert nor will katherine right now i will report her 
 the date unlinking consensus does not apply to timeline articles such as 
 sorry about that and no problem to be honest i didnt realize that it didnt apply to timelines so thanks for letting me know 
 its not easy to find but 
 hmm learn something new everydaythanks 
 hey oldelpaso hope you are well thanks for both the barnstar and the comments on discretionary plurals you may have noticed that after about the third section it all goes into english while up to that point its a poor mix i have done my best this afternoon to iron out the inconsistencies would you be good enough to have a look for me change any i may have missed and comment at the fac for me if you are too busy not a problem cheers 
 spoke too soon the plural vs singular vs ipswich vs their vs its vs were vs was competition has been noted at the fac oh well my energy levels are too low for this right now 
 tell me about it that was fa in six days but there is a chance the ftc for itfc is available for your comment 
 no harm in pileon support should you consider it reasonable perhaps i could secure ft in six hours yeah as for the england manager article id love for more help it started as a copy of the city managers article but blew up a bit it will now make a decent fa in due course im sure and anything you could bring about sven would be top notch 
 lol i cant fault him for effort but hes a very very bad striker not got a bad first touch but the qeN has a smaller turning circle and i also think the qeN has scored more goals for some reason he has cult status at city i wish wed support our good players with the same gusto though that probably says something for his total effort 
 you are probably right his only goal from open play was one of the worst hit shots i have seen but was celebrated as though wed won the league 
 i have reverted where you have added nielsen ratings data for the N season i have never seen this information where does it come from do you have a reference and as this is the official list im not sure a generally accepted figure should be included best wishes 
 my source for the N show was 
 thanks for your note steveo you know even a book of trivia like that can be a valid source one problem i see is that it doesnt appear to be an official number just a number that is generally regarded correct strangely enough in my research i have come across data for N the original amateur hour 
 thats okay did you contest a state byelection in the recent past 
 thought so i read the submission at the time that submission is the reason i knew what you were referring to 
 the review of this has kind of stalled any chance you could cast your eyes over it and let me know what you think all the best 
 thanks for your comments and the good spot i have corrected houlliers omission cheers 
 the active bangla population is growing in wikipedia how about opening a 
 a request try to restrict your comments or messages in english other nonbengali users can also read your talks and communicate bye 
 anyways to a lighter topic the only bangla bands that i truly like are 
 hey look at this i dont even know your name quel est votre nom mademoiselle 
 also i find that the bangla project had previously been created at 
 in this post i shall address each of what you said one by one lol marx wasnt an environmentalist true what i meant was that the wb government has started to do things for solely for the sake of money for example truely what kind of people would get a benefit out of something like sonar tori the rich of course oh how i wish those buildings just evaporate into thin air as for sukumar ray since i have lots to say and believe me lots what ill do is on my free time ill find a list of social commentaries and write an essay on it and then ill put it up somewhere have you read shrishrishobdokolpadroom and chalochitto chanchori both deal with the problem of knowledge and scholasticism and the fight between different schools of thoughtwith a satirical tone of course but that is the aspect that makes it a social commentary i understand why you dont know most of the groups i named a lot of them are 
 chalochittochanchari is my favorite ray after hajabarala remember naxvomicaN d i have both a yahoo and a msn id but i dont have nearly enough time to be actually active on those after the studies i barely find enough time to do daily maintenance tasks on the net im severely alarming myself with the amount im studying and im trying to motivate myself to put in a few more hours daily to cope with the pressure of preparing for iitjee im told that students start preparing for it from class N how horrible of my current teachers only the physics teacher seems to teach at the level of iitjee and thats a cause of concern im particularly worried about my chemistry teacher who knows a lot about chemistry but seems to have a low faith in the abilities of his students and has set his standards very low anyway i have rambled a lot about my studies do you know im credited as the camera assistant in a bangla existensialist movie gloat do you ever come to india 
 wowthe obsession with iitjee sucks the last drop of life out of us children doesnt it my goodness you havent even started class N and you are already worried about jee wowand those people who start preparing from class N wowthat is my only comment i cannot sometimes understand the need to get tutorsit just takes away everythingall free timehobbies etc man that really sucks big time oh and for which movie were you the camera assistant the last movie i saw was N park avenue that was in february lol and yes i come to india every year for two months this year i shall be as well but specifically to research on my 
 actually i find tutors to be important they help me to focus my studies and provide guidance they also let me experience better teachers when the teachers from my own school are not so good my existensialist movie hasnt released yet i believe its due sometime in august or september what are you writing your ee on 
 my ee is most likely on either wastewater management in west bengal or the crisis of groundwater arsenic contamination and possible solutions whats ur movie called oh i have been wanting to askwhich bangla band is the going through its N minutes of fame at the moment 
 just read that you scraped through the first round of that seasons competition by virtue of the fact that you were N ahead against blackpool when the game was abandoned after N minutes due to fog the chances of that happening today are nil jammy bastuds 
 ah yes i misread the note under the game in my book it says after a game abandoned after N minutes because of fog i somehow ignored the after a part at least you progressed via a replay rather than from the initial game which is what i thought 
 i would request you to kindly undo such edits and refrain from editing in such careless manner 
 on that note if you must have a horse breeds originating in india category at least please do not remove the parent category horse breeds we need it for proper navigation and maintenance 
 i suggest you see 
 thanks for the suggestion i had looked at various categories under 
 and the latter includes 
 @fainites you are missing the point the sources that use the term puppet state in discussing this territory are a decided minority (
 but how is that related to images in question nohow all of us agreed on that name we see in image 
 it isnt a question of numbers direktor it doesnt matter how he found them the sources produced are largely by well recognised authors in this field some of whom you use yourself i myself found some more by looking amongst the books i have access to i suggest you do the same i wasnt looking for ones that called it a puppet state i just posted what i found if there are hundreds of sources you should have no difficulty finding some 
 the point is that the poor authors knowing full well the actual situation in the territory were simply not careful about making sure that their every sentence faithfully depicts the state of affairs thus we have wordfishing userpanonian listing authors who explain in detail that the area was a standardissue nazi occupation zone with civil government in place as supposedly claiming that the area was a puppet state 
 by all means produce some of this vast majority it isnt a question of proving a negative either relevent authors will describe it somehow 
 i appreciate your note and after following your direction to the disambiguation page listing all past and present participants in english football carrying the name 
 as for using middle names or middle initials to distinguish between or among samenamed individuals even where known it may not always be desirable as the rules for naming articles point out the title should use the name by which the individual is best known to the public the names of actors 
 recently 
 i have taken care of that he had it titled as an article talk page i deleted it as an orphan i would never have otherwise deleted his subpage thanks for helping with this editor hes enthusiastic as all getout but he needs some guidance 
 my first post was indeed a message to you requesting advice 
 thats true and others replied before i had the chance it seems i apologize for that when you are troubled by other editors the best thing to do is to respond only regarding article content if there are personal attacks ignore them if they try to make the topic personal then you be the one who insists on professionalism if people make it hard for you to edit then seek outside opinions but dont accuse the people of anything seek outside opinions about the edits when outside people come to observe if there are behavior problems they will notice you dont have to accuse anyone of anything if someones behavior is clearly a chronic problem and you know that other people have noticed it then an rfc may be appropriate in summary my answer is that its fine to respond as long as you rigidly limit your response to dry talk about the edits no accusations no exaggeration no emotional language remaining professional is incredibly powerful much more powerful than fighting remember focus on the edits ignore the personalities and resolve conflicts by bringing more people to look at the edits 
 i feel thats enough contributions of mine for the present so i left the article with you to copyedit it and nbsp 
 i know that format such as one in gilbertos article is broadly used but unfortunately its seemingly incompatible with summer league but winter cups countries such as russia and nbsp 
 thats my original notation this information is useful at least it was useful to me so i boldly added these numbers to the article and nbsp 
 i guess to some degree that is in the eye of the beholder to me an article that lists all the other brands of the parent company all the locations of its N sites and little other information except its official website is unambiguously promotional if you remove the promotional info there would be little else thanks 
 the lead and the history sections arent promotional if you ask me feel free to remove the store locations section and the external link im not so sure about the notability though 
 if not and if you do not agree that the said article is the main article for the category a discussion on the same can be started on the categorys 
 rethis is regarding the of my redirecting the page 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised removing will stop the 
 i removed the prod as i believe that there is a likely notable topic under this however if reliable sources arent added it wouldnt surprise me to see this get sent to afd so if you have any idea where to look and could add some sources to verify notability it would be a great help 
 i notice you have been putting in a bit of work on 
 sorry yeah i saw your response at the kinkladze fac but was holding off till other editors came in as far as im concerned everythings probably been done i will take another look at the article before responding on the fac page but im not always the best for the quality of prose which is why i was waiting but will do it in the next couple of days 
 no worries im stuck at work and a bit bored and cant yet get hold of the bradford info till later you have done a cracking job on it steve claridge what a legend though cant believe he hasnt scored in the conference 
 hi i notice that your have moved pages back to this category 
 taxis in india are called taxis not taxicabs please discuss first on talk page before creating a rival category and emptying existing one thanks 
 for reasons that i will not lest your eyes should glaze over recite here but that i have set forth on occasion elsewhere i have a few objections to the conferrence of rollback under the current schema and so i should appreciate your rollbacking me whenever you have a moment many thanks 
 done sorry about that 
 no problem at all (except perhaps that the promptness with which you replied leads me to wonder whether you like your 
 ha ha well issues like this are ones best responding to as soon as possible rather than delaying them it only takes about ten seconds to remove rollback and about N seconds to write a small response 
 thanks for your edit to 
 ok thanks for explaining 
 heya welcome to the disambiguation project i noticed your comment on the done list dont worry about anything except articles theres no need to edit talk page dab links as a matter of fact eventually some hothead will get angry at you for editing their comments good job too skipping the ones you were uncertain of much much better to leave N undone than to make guesses hope to see you in the future 
 ok thanks for advices 
 if you have uploaded other unlicensed media please check whether they are used in any articles or not you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the 
 the what oh i see you probably mean 
 i will be along asap sorry for delay i forgot 
 im still up to my armpits in 
 id like to apologise for missing the fac pretty much entirely until it was too late let me know if i can be of assistance 
 if you insist on using google as a reference that is fine with me but dont 
 censorship thank you for your admission that your personal attack was unfounded not in so many polite words of course but through your here which is good enough for me i too shall consider the matter closed 
 i insist on using complete sources and not replacing them with inferior sources that do not contain the pertinent content no references have been censored you are refering to an edit that you lost during an edit conflict as you kept reinserting your reference in rapidfire manner without review it appears to be fine now 
 excellent work in uploading the posters 
 thanks and you are doing a good job with creating articles 
 and thanks to you re needsplotyes the parameter is no longer valid and can be removed if its added to a talkpage it populates the hidden category film articles with deprecated parameters same with the tag needscastyes which i found useful to populate articles oh well 
 no reason at all i guess at the moment its not really a high priority and i only clean them up when i see articles appear on my watch list feel free to remove any you find 
 i will have a look most of my comments were addressed and i was basically waiting to see what improvements were likely to be made i was a little surprised to see the fac closed so soon but i will certainly have a look for you 
 i would tag the honours as unreferenced section but that might get me in hot water images is a big issue and not something you can do anything about ( 
 or stylebordertop N px solid gray or just had to award you a barnstar for all your work regarding film articles great job 
 thanks its much easier and more rewarding to work when i know that my work is noticed 
 hi tired_time i changed the dvd cover to the film poster as i feel for historical importance that it would be better to show off how the film poster as it better represents the film at the time of its release if you look at 
 no problem thanks for asking i started on wikipedia just uploading posters and adding infoboxes too if you have any further questions do not hesitate to ask keep up the great work 
 thanks for adding the poster images i was wondering if you could ensure that the posters are at most N pixels at their width i saw some N px posters and it could be a little smaller just use an image editing program like ms paint most of the posters sizes are appropriate though keep up the good work 
 thanks i didnt know that posters have to be N px at most i suspect that no distributor has ever complained about movie poster in wikipedia being too big so in my opinion it doesnt matter that much but ok i will do that anyway 
 it has more to do with wikipedia protecting itself when it comes to having nonfree content they have 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or awarded to kfp for quickly responding to my need for an admin on the enwikipedia irc chanel 
 well thank you 
 hi i have reviewed your ga nomination of 
 following the enhancements you and peanutN have made over the past few days i am happy to pass this article as a ga congrats 
 hi we are in sore need of additional volunteers at 
 sure i wouldnt mind helping out there especially now when vernowhitney has taken over wpscv they seem to interested in people who can speak languages other than english which i do so that might he helpful i will take a closer look tomorrow going to bed now 
 good night and im very glad for verno since its given you more time at cci which is giving me a bit more time at otrs (and by the way pursuant to 
 yeah according to you made your first edit on april N anyway i have been thinking about your question or offer and decided that now is probably not the right time thanks for the support though 
 well done for tracking down the poster and sticking it in the article 
 well thanks but its not a big deal it only takes N minutes to do that 
 thanks 
 loving all the recent additions esp the one on 
 well im glad that u like it 
 thanks for the note i will do some research when i have time im supposed to be out on my bike today as i have a N mile charity ride next weeknd but the weather is putting me off so my wife wants me to do some decorating yuck 
 now expanded cheers 
 history is written by the winners probably because they have better sources what i have used in 
 i will see what i can do with blues route to the final then it was all away from home the only time a team had reached the final without playing at home and it all went wonderfully up until 
 should have something ready by this afternoon on route to final hate reading about the N team topclass keeper solid defence midfield full of hard bastards who could pass forwards goalscoring attackers be nice if the current lot had even one or two of the above cheers 
 have done a bit on postmatch 
 does look better with the quote moved to a footnote if only more readers ever looked at footnotes as to photographs when my lot played at plymouth a couple of years ago alex govan was halftime star of the day and spent some time at the blues end milking the applause and having his picture taken unfortunately i left my seat on the stroke of halftime to do what one does at halftime if one has been in the pub beforehand and missed it all cheers 
 my books have remarkably little on the final itself rather more on the semifinal cant think why im sure there was a rule at one stage that if a change of strip was needed then both teams had to change but whether that applied in N i have no idea also according to we played in black shorts and socks not blue and they certainly look havery dark in contemporary b and w photos do you have anything in writing that says blue i will do something to the description of kinseys goal later cheers 
 thanks for uploading the dvd cover of 
 its not a big deal it only takes N minutes to do that 
 cheers dude i will see if i can drag the little man to the library on saturday morning while the wifes having her indian head massage whatever the hell that is 
 found it cheers saves having to take a bored N year old to the library 
 i am not sure if you are complete with my concerns just checking up if so reply on my talk page
 did you make all the improvements that came out of the fa process for the article i cant really tell from 
 just out of interest how did you read those russian links i have not even got the right characters displaying 
 i have fixed up some of the references but couldnt do the the foreign language ones please note that the links for all derby evening telegraph citations are broken and redirect to the home page not sure if they have been deleted which is a pain given how much they have been used i have noted a dead telegraph link and google returns no replacement hope you can fix things back again 
 why did you ask to delete the file the law jpg its usable in the article about the film and the fair use claim appears valid isee theresanother image in the articleat the moment but since it was released under both titles both would seem appropriate 
 yea i uploaded the image currently used in the article shortly after uploading the one i am requesting to delete because i realized that the poster i uploaded is a rerelease poster and original posters are preferred in wikipedia many movies have many posters but its standard to upload only one poster if fair use is claimed according to 
 anywho just wondering what your plans are for the article if you dont mind then i will follow where you lead 
 i will see what i can add to it starting tuesday if i can i have got a couple of semiauthorative sources dont suppose you have any which could help us add to the article 
 wow very nice im limited to online sources so hopefully the holes in my knowledge wont become too obvious but i have shown a knack before for unearthing random bits of useful info online that you might otherwise never come across so we shall see 
 hi somehow we missed this ladys to the wa lc to replace 
 nup you got em all weird when that sort of thing happens hey with the new replacements its pretty much a matter of watching the relevant ecs page as it never makes the news thats how i found out who giffards replacement was 
 great answer on the ref desk misc i spent ages searching for a result you sound knowledgeable care to add a little something to our useless stub 
 thanks i am an amateur here i can do the desk and edit but to my shame have never made a proper article thanks a lot and i look forward to reading it 
 and again thanks for the article its great to see desk questions answered well and added to the encyclopedia 
 or 
 two dyks in one day well done 
 do you think thats feasible i have never taken an article to fac so not really sure whats required but id be happy to cooperate if you think its worth a try congratulations on mr trautmann and presumably your statue photo could also be used in this article wont be around much this week but from next week it could have my full attention such as that is cheers 
 what do you think of which appears to be becoming standard usage in cup final articles apart from the randomlyallocated players positions unkeyed abbreviations unnecessary small font use of flags contrary to mos team lists positioned in apparently random columns and loss of the match rules bit that was in the previous oldefashioned version i dont like it much cheers 
 between us we seem to be using N or N different formats for page numbers in the references as generates page numbers in the format p N i will go through at some point and make them all that format for consistency one wonders why cite news generates the p prefix when doesnt all the same cheers 
 done that there were one or two missing publication dates etc as well think i have caught them all cheers 
 hi there just to let you know im off to man city v liverpool on sunday and was wondering if there were any photos of anything youd like taken even though i will be pretty much snapping everything anyway cheers 
 cool thanks and i was offered the chance to go and thought to myself why not see some of the best players in the world and should be a good day out although i am at york v cambridge tomorrow just means a lot of travel cheers

 hola sexfN or alex quiero tu va a 
 yes sure send them to me although if i havent done them by months end i probably wont get around to them for some time after that also do you have necessary information to complete 
 sure and nope when my current workload ends i will be able to check N from hughes and graham but i dont have either side of that confirmed 
 yes to both 
 i intend to find out in the next week what the N comparatives were for these four electorates and the names of the minor candidates 
 who is 
 are you back or am i still 
 i spent a couple of hours buried in the bham mail microfilm archives the other day a special treat given i only visit bham for matches these days and hope to have another go on tuesday if theres any particular area you think could do with filling out from the bham angle let me know trouble is i get distracted into areading the damn paper rather than just skimming through specific football news cheers 
 what we dont mention anywhere is the change of colours i have a newspaper ref which says to avoid confusion manchester had dropped its sky blue and birmingham its royal blue for the occasion but no idea whether they were required to by the fa or their own idea or what cheers 
 also i have had a fiddle with the teamsheet layout 
 you have twice nominated an indian school for 
 for the record i am an admistrator of N months standing i have been active on articles for deletion for N months i assess articles against the standards of speedy deletion which are much stricter than articles for deletion in no way does this article meet the criteria for speedy deletion if it was to be deleted there would be a motion to undelete it 
 aside from the page violating condition #N the first paragraph does not specificlly mention that the american buffalo gold coin is a covered coin would this effectively null the fp stsus of the image or does this need further debate 
 hi the result of the (part of which is at 
 cheers for that i have added it into the article btw i have addressed the points you raised at the 
 many thanks for your support 
 alex i replied to your note on uN 
 hey congrats on that as for yesilkxfN y can you tell me more about that hotel now you have me all intrigued uN 
 ah thanks for the explanation that was really interesting i will make sure to keep an eye on that page then uN 
 id say once the lead is expanded a bit if you think the prose is ok submit it as soon as you like blues have no midweek games for a bit so i have only got normal reallife stuff to get in the way of my wikipeding cheers 
 terrified opponents pity warhurst wasnt playing you should allude to it its another illustration of your lot appearing to want it more cheers 
 i changed your edits to 
 response on my talk page hey it is nice to see users like yourself who are educated cultured and mature thanks for the discussion 
 i have a linguistic question for you the latin name of bolzano is reported to be bauzanum this conains the letter z a letter that otherwise in latin occurs only in loan words from greek how was that z pronounced are there other latin place names in the region with a z was a nonlatin 
 likewise and thanks for convincing me itd be possible cheers 
 theres always though in the general scheme of things its probably not that notable but if i ever get round to expanding 
 should have sacked him after the preferably on the pitch couldnt have made it worse 
 i found your name in the category of wikipedians who speak italian a user has requested an article on the composer giorgio mainerio (see 
 thanks no hurry of course someone else already created the stub at 
 considering the statement on your user pages complaints department section #N xenophrenic is not assuming good faith i offer you this user box in good faith you can bend or edit it to reflect your views as i did for mine hope you have use for it and enjoy it as i did on my userpage 
 i will trust your words that your offer was made in good faith despite recent comments that might indicate the edited user box you display is less than accurate it does use the qualifier usually after all best regards to you 
 i must say that i dislike userboxes too only that this one i found quite intriguing and couldnt resist as for the usually of course there are always occasions where doubt comes in yet at the end it is or can be resolved even w or o talking but rather watching guess you can agree on the latter i stand to my comments yet my comments dont have to stay best 
 i too stand by my comments even when their usefulness eludes less perceptive readers as for lists if i were to keep a trust list it would start blank and only be populated by those that earned their way onto it by that same standard im confident i am on every list i desire to be on heres hoping all our future interactions land us on our respective alists 
 hi there cheers a lot for your review of the sunderland afc 
 hi again in response to your offer to help polish the article up id like to work with you to get it up to the featured mark thanks 
 i have responded to your queries on the talk page 
 hi just checking up do you think it will take much before i can fac it again if not how about another peer review tah 
 i have had a go at adjusting it i think the hooliganism was pretty exagerated as sunderland arent a club particularly famed for it i have removed the whole part about the middlesbrough clash i also gave archibald leitch a mentioning cheers 
 hello however this is only a proposed guideline so a discussion need to be held about that one thing is for sure there is no need no categorize these churches under byzantine empire when appropriate subcats exist 
 thanks for your response i am glad that we have settled this issue and thank you for that articles i like architectural landmarks so much and these articles are very nice do you plan to start another ones 
 cheers oep i have got some good stuff out of that and added it into the article 
 sounds bang on i will happily help you integrate any new material you discover into the article if needed 
 could your check the stub for potential inaccuracies thanks 
 i have no objections to your proposal best 
 out of interest how do super league fixtures being listed on wikipedia constitute copyright violation they were listed for the N season with no issues and the entire super league fixtures and results were posted on the 
 many thanks for the quick response 
 thats some fantastic expansion you have done today cheers for that im thinking of putting the article back up for pr again and then potentially taking it to flc now that its so much more indepth what do you reckon 
 hey i wont hear a word said against emlyn hughes i used to think he was great on question of sport when i was about N and i was reading roy of the rovers when he played for melchester anyhow i have pulled out a few sentences from other sections of ol willie macs article and combined them into an outside football section where i think the new stuff you mentioned on my talk page would fit nicely by the way could you add a reference from your book for his kids names as currently the sentence is only refed by the ond which doesnt mention the names all the best 
 i have adjusted the article to allow for both pointsofview in each case as it happens i have got the day off work tomorrow and the church where hes buried is only about N minutes drive from my house so i might amble up there and see if i can snap a picture of his tombstone to put in the death section 
 the churchyard turned out to be huge and very overgrown i had a good look round but couldnt find his grave and it started chucking it down with rain so i came home p 
 hi oldelpaso i am currently having a 
 thanks for the comments i was wondering how to update a newer version of an image do i upload it from scratch or update it somewhere else 
 i will try to help as i can primarily by checking them for minor errors or stylistic issues but on the whole i think they are well written and balanced if i find any major problems i will let you know cheers 
 likewise a happy new year alessandro i am checking your new article out however you might like to read this free about the 
 i have the article on my watchlist and have watched as the article has taken shape in glorious fashion i will dig out the books tommorrow and i should have time to expand it as much as i can regards 
 i couldnt find any extra information in the couple of books that i have they duplicate what is already in the article and for the most part actually expand on that information sorry i couldnt be of any help regards 
 you have once again reverted changes that were discussed at length in the talk section please stop you are welcome to participate and add your voice to the discussion 
 there had been an ongoing debate about that section in the talk and you changed what we were working on without referencing that you were changing that section 
 no worries tech problems happen to us all 
 hello alessandro great work on the article as usual i have done my bit however i have three questions a the webpage for the water supply project seems to imply that the original byzantine aqueducts went further west into thrace and the halkali and belgrade forest lines were subsidiary or at any rate not connected with the valens aqueduct so it would be incorrect to call the entire system halkali net i have left it for now but id like to know what your sources are saying b im not sure that taksim is greek sure the ks does not usually appear in turkish words but i cannot think of any similar greek word that has the meaning of water plant any clues c i dont know of any jelus cistern in constantinople are you sure of the name anyway keep up the good work perhaps you could add some stuff to my pet article on the walls of constantinople especially if you can get your hands on millingens book sorry that the article i gave you wasnt of much help if theres anything else just tell me although im rather busy with university exams right now cheers 
 re taksim see 
 with regards to links to youtube etc it is wikipedia policy to remove any links to copyright violating material on sight none ought to be present in terms of the links you have been adding there is a distinct commercial interest to your additions since legitimate highlights packages are available from multiple providers eg club websites bt vision there is no compelling reason why all english club pages should link to virgin media over any other 
 please offer your opinion on the two 
 hi to put an image on your user page you have to upload the image via 
 the box is in the watchlist section of 
 or keep up the good work you got the coveted pictured slot too 
 ok cool i know saving each version is more convenient i am also not very good at using the preview function but it really saves a lot of work later on i think its weird that those links were taken out i see no problem even websites with copyright are obviously allowed to be put into the external links section can you give me a specific example where it was taken out lets put the byzantium N sites back on and if someone objects again we can discuss the issue at a later point 
 hello again alex i thought polytonic greek was included in the standard unicode packages in windows i guess i was wrong you can nevertheless go to download a couple of fonts as for football in N as we say in greece god was sleeping this time around he wasnt pity for italy too but i am glad our eastern neighbours made it through cheers 
 coincidentally as you have probably seen i was already in the process of doing so done for now i will throw another look on some of the churchmosque articles in the weekend cheers 
 hello alessandro do you still reside in uN stanbul btw thanks for new articles about mosqueschurches 
 nice so maybe we will meet next year 
 yes to a oneyear school study program 
 heh enigmatic am i its down to a perpetual habit of visiting my mother in 
 funny thing is im pretty sure the island isnt named after the stinking fish but i dont mind perpetuating the myth yeah moustachioed one needs a touch more polish and then he will be winging his awesome self over to fac 
 this identification is just a pious legend you shouldnt take it too seriously 
 i will address the issue tonight 
 hello oldelpaso yes i would greatly appreciate it if you could provide more of your insightful opinion on the articles talk page it would be a privilege to learn more about improving articles from a person with such a fantastic record in helping promote articles to fa especially since you led the fac of the scotland football team thanks again for your suggestions and offer to continue providing improvements to the article feel free to contact me again if you ever think i may be able assistance to you 
 hello again oldelpaso i started a peer review for the article 
 hi is the above categorized under because the churchesmosques and istanbul feature in greeces history 
 thanks for your reply it made sense as soon as i read constantinople which id forgotten was istanbuls former name i will now amend the templates categorization to include 
 hey thanks for your comments at the fac i was wondering if you had some good alternative sources for his time at liverpool i can easily draught out some more of what happened to liverpool while he was there but other than that i have to rely on his autobiography for anything more detailed and personal cheers 
 hey i have expanded the section a little bit ultimately he made N league appearances in four seasons so it wasnt brilliant but you were right the N or N season was exceptional 
 hello alessandro long time no see how are you everything fine i hope i have just uploaded a based on janins map with the roads and various other corrections or additions gathered by various more recent sources however since you have better access to bibliography concerning the city than i at the moment i would be very glad if you could check it for errors and omissions whenever you have time its been rather long in the making but i cannot rule out that any mistakes did not slip in cheers and best regards 
 oh i am sorry to hear that whatever it is hopefully you will get over it take your time with the map any help will be appreciated but health comes first my best wishes and perastika as we say in greece 
 hello buddy when you will be in istanbul again 
 oh hope you will get well and it wont be serious i am already there since the start of october will stay at least until june let me know when you will come here again 
 hey oldelpaso thanks for your comments and now support at the above flc any chance i could ask you to cap your comments as the flc is already becoming borderline 
 well if you could throw some references into 
 no i dont like coords either perhaps a little map for each one would be best anything else you could help with would be ace 
 hi there i have made some suggestions at the farc talk page check them out when you can regards 
 its been kept but could you find a ref for that last sentence i pointed out see 
 im still confused to be fair so its ok to the contents of 
 fair enough thanks 
 dear alessandro you wrote this info belongs to the voice about the peak not here as a matter of fact it belongs to both places surely the information that there is a peak named after the settlement is relevant to the settlement and its article best 
 and finally i agree with you that the information may not have been inserted in the best place please feel free to put it anyplace you may consider more suitable best 
 yes i have been several times there in the antarctic peninsula region didnt see many italians though as they are mainly working far away in east antarctica best 
 many thanks alessandro best 
 geographical names in antarctica usually come from several different fields including names of world or national geography history and culture see 
 it would be nice to have wikipedia articles also for the antarctic geographical features with italian names one may find their descriptions in english performing a search with parameter country of origin italy and number of records unlimited that would produce all italian names together with their descriptions best 
 dear alessandro apologies for my belated response well the established international agreement and practice is that each country gives names in antarctica in its own language which may or may not be english but names should be romanized ie converted to latin alphabet not in their original cyrillic chunese indian or japanese script yes i am using descriptions from the 
 why was 
 a damn shame one of my favourite articles too i would have loved to see it on the front page one day 
 hi my name is will nice to meet you i will be reviewing the above article for ga is there anything i should know before i begin or anything you want to tell me 
 okay i will start the review process now 
 there are two small matters left at 
 for helping me out with your small edits to 
 xd thanks 
 you beat me to the greeting glad to see you back here after so long thanks for the appreciative comments i look forward to work with you once again cheers 
 alas no i have been dying to go again to the city for a couple of years now especially with the yenikapi dig going on but havent found either the time or the money to do so i really envy you your trips there if you have any photos please please upload them in commons 
 ah i see pity anyhow i am chiefly interested in the ships found at yenikapi for the 
 no worries id almost forgotten about it have we preserved the bronze star 
 okay well if anything does crop up you need a hand with dont hesitate to give me a shout 
 hello alessandro the suburb of 
 nope it is correct i had created the redirect as a first step to writing a short article about the quarter and the monastery since kosmidion is actually a small part of the modern district of eyup i have only the odb with its small relevant passage to go on so since you have access to janin a most excellent source if you want to go ahead and make a start 
 ah i see i added the name pity about janin i did hope hed say more most of the books i have on constantinople have next to nothing on kosmidion ( 
 a certain 
 thank you for your courtesy in notifying me i have made a very short comment at the arbcom case and will await whatever result happens i imagine someone will tell me the outcome at some point 
 once and for all i have no interest in any form of interaction with you i neither know nor care who you are or anything about you i will not take part in this process that you have started except for the brief paragraph that i have entered 
 great article i was always meaning to write it myself but never got around to it it is indeed a beautiful place albeit for a greek rather a sad one 
 sad because in a few years the balikli graveyards will be all thats left of the greek community in the city and after they are gone i dont think the turkish government will care much to maintain the place 
 from your mouth to gods ear as the saying goes 
 hi i would have no problem passing the article with the current hook but if we can think of something catchier im pretty convinced we can make it a more popular dyk do let me know if you insist on the current hook or you could perhaps come up with a few other suggestions if youd like i could try to think of a few alternative hooks too best uN 
 i tried to summarize the part about the frying fish in a hook you may take a look and improve it if you like or suggest a different wording ideally i think it should be mostly your choice as to which hook is the best the church certainly offers at least a few truly interesting possibilities though uN 
 i tweaked it a little since its not a proper name anymore otherwise its cool im not sure i can verify a hook that i have had a hand in suggesting though will have to ask around uN 
 ah didnt know you meant that but then wouldnt it have to be fall of the city as opposed to fall of the city and then again i think the name was to be found in greek usage not in english so id rather we keep it as it currently is up to you of course best uN 
 well its certainly educating for the reader so we could try might be a good idea to ask for the opinion of someone unfamiliar with the topic though we want the hook to be easy to understand best uN 
 you are welcome mate another quality addition to the series its good for dyk i reckon uN 
 anyway thanks for your time would love to hear any ideas you might have 
 in response to your reply i have actually already drafted up a city in europe article or the basis of one you can check it out 
 dont suppose you would look over 
 believe me you deserve it and i am sure that somewhere along the way a wptr award will come too cheers 
 well done as usual i made a few cosmetic changes added a map and tagged a couple of problematic places what do you mean by freed in the second paragraph of the history section 
 ok i fixed it cheers 
 beatthecrat congratulations from me 
 thanks i am glad to see i have that kind of support from other users uN 
 hey oep sorry to be constantly plaguing you i was just wondering if you had any books which cover scores during the wwN years i appear to have hit upon an inaccuracy in mcfcstats otherwise brilliant coverage 
 i was aware yes and very sad it was when i heard the news im also aware that his son is trying to revamp the site could you possibly look up some scores for me its the subsidiary tournament of the N season it was a four team tournament so it will only be N games in your own time of course i have plenty of jobs i can get on with if you are busy for a few days or weeks i will eventually get that book by the way but having only just started a job on minimum wage im somewhat strapped for cash at present 
 incidentally that link is interesting i dont know much about it but its a curious offer and its certainly appealing only problem is that ea is only interested in presentday footballers and im not sure i have any knowledge about our current team that N other people dont have i kind of wish that ea would give more information about the roles im not really sure whether im what they are looking for or not or was the comment just some wry humour about my lack of cash 
 interesting i looked on there myself and didnt find any records for the war years maybe they were somewhere else but anyway thanks oep you are truly a legend 
 we have an emergency report to caubxd immediately and click on the last e in the link userfredil yupigo or signature 
 hello alessandro your action was quite correct there are a number of policies that deal with this chiefly 
 the situation is bad not yet hopeless but bad people are losing their jobs and those who have them often get unpaid as there isnt any cash available rents debts and salaries are often not paid for months at a time we are still waiting for some research grants we were definitely promised in september and which we dont know when and if they will ever come i have got colleagues who are owed arrears for teaching jobs at universities for over a year now those who suffer most are lower middleclass people ie the bulk of the population but mostly in athens the provinces have not yet felt the impact so hard chiefly because there is the usual big family support mechanism and because life is about N per cent cheaper there than the capital but i can tell you if someone shot a politician tomorrow quite a few would applaud it 
 hello alessandro nice photos indeed for the video afaik all wikipedia cares about is that it is properly licensed we dont really go for the religious sensitivities thing so for instance we have photos of 
 go ahead he has an amazing mastery of colours i wish i could take photos half as good as his 
 anyway i added back turkish airlines a neighborhood article needs to cover the major corporations with head offices in the neighborhood 
 aha i had the impression that 
 i see so to disambiguate one could say 
 yeah its pretty late i need to be going to bed soon 
 do you do zurich area photo requests if so if you dont mind i have a few to present 
 thats not really my field of expertise but i will see if i can do anything 
 hmm could you link me to the article again please 
 thats odd there doesnt seem to be a specific wikiproject for the armed forces im sure the gan might attract the attention of a good copyeditor though 
 might be worth a try 
 im having a hard time with this sentence in the new version two fN s piloted by colonel anthony schiavi and major daniel nash flew acrambled to fly to new york neither is it grammatically correct nor do i understand what you want to say 
 i need two more sources then it can pass ga 
 this guy is simply censoring information that is unpleasing to him i am not even bsing it is straight up censoring i keep putting sourced statements from people who were actually at an event and he takes it off i need help with this 
 on a related issue do you think that i went too far with in response to the neanderthal comment immediately above i didnt want to inflame an already volatile situation but most people would have taken an exceedingly dim view of similar comments made about people from other continents i was less than impressed with but i dont see the value in attempting to continue the discussion regards 
 hello alex i hope you are well although there are quite a lot of books on it in greek personally i am unaware of any englishlanguage publications on the matter from what i have read the prevailing opinion among the more serious scholars is that it was not a genocide in the sense that there was not a systematic governmentsponsored annihilation campaign as that directed against the armenians as you know labelling an event as genocide is mostly a political weapon nowadays and is so frequently used that it has virtually lost its meaning while the pontians too were subject to the forced labour battalions during wwN they were not really targeted for extermination and some of the local bishops were able to prevent even their conscription in the labour battalions and in turn protected the muslim population during the russian occupation of N most casualties occurred during the chaotic situation in the pontus in N when government control collapsed and the countryside was dominated by greek and turkish armed bands needless to say violence was reciprocal but still rather limited the turks did not undertake a more systematized suppression and deportation campaign until N to remove the threat of a second front during the greek advance in the west this sparked the most bloody phase with a very violent guerrilla warfare going on as the pontians were driven from the cities to the mountains on the turkish side the bands of topal osman loosely controlled by the kemalist government were responsible for several atrocities while the pontians too did undertake several reprisals and massacres against muslim villages even so the number of pontian victims overall is comparatively low iirc some N depending on estimates it was certainly an act of ethnic cleansing but if the kemalists had wanted to eradicate the pontians theyd have done it and no one would have been able to do anything about it 
 id say persist this mania to label everything as genocide is not only absurd it is pernicious the word is so loaded with negative connotations that it only perpetuates hatred and divisions while distorting the true historical events it makes a monolithic tale out of the complex weave that is human history places it on a pedestal with the words dont touch upon it stopping any genuine research and reflection on causes and significance it must be opposed whether it comes from greek turkish italian albanian chinese or whatever else nationalists 
 ps lewellyn smith is one of my favourite authors too even though he is an ardent philhellene he does not hesitate to call a spade a spade when it comes to what actually happened i have gifted a greek edition of his book to most of my friends 
 well being a philhellene does not mean being unobjective or biased scholars like finlay runciman smith mazower are all interested in greece and appreciate and love greek history culture and the greek people but that doesnt stop them from being objective and telling the dark side the errors and crimes of greek history as well just like many greeks do its only nationalists who view this as treason to the cause personally i am with 
 thanks for noticing my typo 
 no problem are you swedish 
 no but i do have a degree in biology 
 i agree with you that it is too early to change the governmental listings of libyan cities from libya to 
 hallo bejar sorry maybe i was too fast and i wrote a comment only on the first revert anyway my point is clear and coincides with yours the situation there is too fluid and such edits doe not make any sense moreover they are also incorrect the edit was in field country if there had been a field government it would have been correct but so it is plainly wrong there is still one libya at least until a division will be officially ratified the place could be the discussion page of libya i think but i think that this only white noise as a large part of the work done here ( cheers 
 bingo you are quite right there is a lot of furore the past few days over a statement of the turkish fm mehmet davutoglu who stated that kastellorizo is not in the aegean but in the eastern mediterranean albeit he did qualify it as a greek island the rub is that if kastellorizo is part of the aegean then it will be considered along with the other aegean islands in any grecoturkish settlement which means it will be accorded a 
 you can read a few more details cheers 
 oh i quite agree that kastellorizo isnt really in the aegean but that is what happens when politicians appropriate neutral geographical labels for their own purposes nice series of articles thanks a lot although my knowledge of italian is rather poor i can read it well enough on account of my french and spanish the title is spot on imo 
 no i didnt know that of course there are a few on this side of the aegean who make similar gestures but when it comes from the actual leadership and not fringe mps it is worrisome lets hope that in the next visit to eyxfcp he wont be girded with the sword of osman 
 anyone know 
 someone has been messing with the link on the 
 they were capitalisation issues fixed the ones above 
 the reason i put that tag is the article has only N source to fix the problem you should first fix stub tag by adding more information on it and then try to adding source to article to make them verfied and reliable and then i will remove the tag and usually this process of tagging being done automatically 
 oh you did not understand this tag means the article relies only on one source if that is not a source the issue become worse and we should tag as unreferenced 
 the primary one is for not having a linked one source if your source is book put isbn and if not try to add a source that has a link to elswhere 
 from linking i meant have close relationship with article subject read here http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or wikipediano_original_research#primaryN c_secondary_and_tertiary_sources 
 i knew that before happy you understand so first of all try to fix stub and then we go on about citations

 hey i donated to getup for that one they were just over half way to the target needed to publish at the time glad to see they made it (not usually big on getup causes they take on basically every trendy left issue going but since an accidental drive on a family holiday through an area near 
 ps im heading off on holiday ina matter of minutes so wont read your reply for a week but rest assured i will reply when i get back so no rush in replying and if you think the idea is a nonstarter then please do slate it because the last thing i want to do is get ideas that its sensible when it isnt 
 fair enough i cant really dispute your logic because now i give it thought its pretty obviously true thanks for the insight all the same 
 thanks for the relentless hard work you have put in oep for the record i wouldnt begrudge you taking anything from my userspace if you yourself deemed it worthy but i will put it into the mainspace regardless thanks one more time for all the work i will get back to work myself on the other articles soon but right now i just still need a little break from it all i did finish one article though so i will stick that up on the mainspace too 
 i never considered that angle before i like the idea of posting new articles neat and complete but giving it some thought your method does work pretty nicely i will use that system next time 
 curious thanks for the headsup thankfully N per cent of my articles are all my own work 
 hello alessandro im fine thanks a lot i hope the same is true on your side too on the issue at hand i agree that the agenda is obvious although carefully phrased to appear neutralish i am not an expert in islamic issues but id say your point is correct from the moment that the prayer was uttered in a building that was a focal point of one religion and was clearly intended to serve a similar role under islam it became a mosque especially since ritual trappings are rather unimportant in islam a mosque being primarily a congregation hall you might want to ask some other users perhaps at 
 hah well i wouldnt know things are bad no sign of improving yet people are increasingly not paying their bills as cash is scarce allaround if you have money set aside now is the time to come to greece and buy cheap cars flats and what not people are fed up with our politicos for instance i have heard of cases where ministers have gotten booed out of restaurants but again this has been so for the past ten years or so and theres no real alternative and thats the worst thing this sense of stagnation and hopelessness as the saying here goes we have already it rock bottom and have started digging 
 the crisis is still felt more than seen and the situation hasnt yet become desperate we are still a quite affluent nation after all and we still like to have a good time eat well and spend money when abroad perhaps all the more in times like these when the general atmosphere is rather depressive 
 hmmm the issue is odd if his only concern is that a building is used as a church or mosque etc vs is a church or mosque then this is a content dispute i do agree that there is probably another agenda given the previous discussions but the issue is whether you can prove it so far the user hasnt violated any wp policies so you cant refer him to 
 well thats one of the joys of participating in an international opentoall encyclopedia cheers and bon courage 
 good reply 
 i have made a suggestion to end this dispute if it is picked up ok otherwise admin intervention will probably be required you can try ani although odds are that you will be referred back to rfc for dispute resolution 
 {{#if or 
 absolutely no problem i think it is pretty much there now just a few little stylistic issues being brought up now regards 
 hello i have reviewed 
 i have now passed this article as a good article congratulations 
 which books are they that you have managed to get a hold of i was hoping to get a copy of myself but xaN is a bit out of my price range at the minute as for the article i think a mention of some of the united v city testimonial matches that have taken place would be a good idea iirc denis irwins testimonial was against city so we have got a fairly recent one right there uN 
 how about a bit about some of the players who have played for both clubs good luck with it give me a shout if you want someone to copyedit 
 ok to discuss the matter but writing famous famous everywhere is discouraged in wikipedia i wonder how can you accuse me of vandalism since i am one of the most active anitvandals here especially for what concerns italian articles i notice i had also corrected your error of confusing tuff with tufa in english ciao and good work 
 honestly i consider your version quite poor from the format point of view but anyway its ok ciao e buon viaggio 
 sorry but i gave a look to the differences and the pov in your article is rather inacceptable also with vandalism you perhaps meant the limination of the most beautiful or so or the description of st peters appearance as a postcard but i think for such speculations you should provide a source otherwise its difficult to sustain that a church is a postcard in an encyclopedia which does not accept

 hey there i saw that you own the book football against the enemy by kuper i was wondering if it has a chapter dedicated to the jew coach 
 im away from home at the moment and so cannot check but i will do so tomorrow 
 guttmann is not mentioned anywhere in football against the enemy sorry i couldnt be of more help 
 kind thanks alot anyway 
 unless the respectivly refer to michaelangelo and leonardo in which case change thathepreceding he to they i hake no claims to know a geat dea about this subject i merely admire sinanswor immensely am trying to improve th readability of this article which has clearly been largely written by people who are notnative speaers of english 
 i like the expression washing in the thames very much i will be more careful in the future 
 as discussed on the section you started on the talk page 
 this is according to the subject of the article any other sources thanks 
 thats from an article by cnn however cnn got it that makes it perfectly good enough it is not for us to question their methods they are the reliable source we merely report on what they say frankly N per cent of the information in any cnn article will come from what people say we have to trust their judgement in what they print its not as if this were a particularly controversial fact if you want to rewrite the sentence so it makes this more clear feel free but if you strike it as unsourced im going to have to revert you personally i dont have a stake in elonkas fame or fortune but her article has been a target for many people with no good reason 
 i have reviewed this article and placed it on hold pending the resolution of a few issues feel free to ping me when you have had a chance to address my concerns cheers 
 i have taken a second look and passed this article as a ga congrats 
 hello and thanks for asking i think you are right to include the material if mr young included his personal difficulties whether personal mental or financial in his autobiography then he put them into the public domain accepting them as part of his life so we shouldnt be leaving them out of his wiki bio there are too many biographical articles about footballers that drivel on about how many goals he scored and what he won without offering any understanding of the man behind the player cant help but feel for the bloke cheers 
 i agree with everything struway says above 
 hi i appreciate your help with this article and providing the hangul and hanja for it but i hope you are aware that by changing the title of the article while it is still undergoing the featured article candidate process you literally just $ per cent @ed everything up now the link to the fac page on the talk page is red meaning that there is no fac page in existence for choe bu although there still is one for choe pu floating somewhere out there in wikiland please fix this or im sorry but i will have to revert your edit i hope you understand 
 in the meantime i left a note on the choe pu section of

 ok thats great thanks 
 nice work 
 what should be done about user that keeps adding william genovese to the genovese crime family article iuN ve checked william genovese is a hacker not a mobster the reference he is using is a deadlink iuN ve checked new york times archive there isnuN t any author by that name or any title by the one that is provided 
 hi i noticed you marked these flights as scheduled to end on january N N i tried and was not able to find any evidence of this could you tell me how you found this information refs 
 ah i see thats interesting frontier makes no mention of this schedule change anywhere on their site i always wondered why they wasted time flying to both bwi and dca anyway i guess they figured there was little point in having both flights since both airports serve roughly the same area and most people flying to either were headed to dc anyhow 
 please do not change the fleet table your table gives information that should be in the fleet area but not in the table please look at all the major airlines and see how they are layed out this is the most favored layout as well 
 why would i mind as long as it is relevant if their is important information such as entry into service or if something happened with a certain aircraft or if they announced some sort of order thats when it is relevant to be in the table but outside of the table thats pretty much anything regarding the fleet so feel free to insert relevant items such as some of the information formerly in the table which was in your version of the table 
 maybe you could upload some of the photos and put them aside the fleet table like the boeing N already their maybe you should add the one of the boeing N s even though the photos are useful not many people actually take the time to click and go and view the photo so i suggest you add one or two photos throughout the page 
 i found this N commission chart can you upload the image on the commission page i dont known who owns the rights its says fbi but it could be from the valachi hearings thanks 
 for the colombo family chart 
 well i do believe if you click help in the navigation box and then click copyright tags they will show all the tags with descriptions on which one to use then choose the one and copy it paste it in the description box of the image upload page and then submit the photo that should do it 
 the creator of the photos has a strict copyright on the photos he stated that i can ask permission to use the photo which i have done for you i selected the boeing N i believe and if he gives me permission i will find the copyright tag and insert it for you 
 great 
 can you explain why you keep on changing nba finals appearance to nba finals selection selection is simply the wrong word to use because players arent selected to play in the finalsuN 
 sorry my mistakeuN 
 on the subject of rfa please do not explicitly modify other users comments as you did we do not know that americaN intended to support the candidate uN 
 if they messed up the numbering repair the numbering dont change what they wrote its a major faux pas uN 
 anyhow i know it was in good faith so dont sweat it but just keep that in mind for the future uN

 thanks dude thank you very very much 
 responded on the articles talk page

 fiy N may well be the same as 
 im quite certain he is the same and have been for some time thanks for your interest 
 anway i did an ani and a sockpuppet notice as on his talk page this fellow is taking up too much time 
 im glad to see your recent activity proves you were not the pilot of the tiger moth which crashed two days ago in dorset rotten luck for the two guys in the kite which was seen doing aerobatics prior to augering in a morbid subject and the missus is worried i still want to take a ride how is the airworthiness of your moth 
 yes a very nasty one that plenty of theories going around but i am fairly sure i know what happened our moth is about two weeks away from flying again and there may be a delay of a further two weeks for paperwork to come back from the caa after that im doing an hour in a 
 stay safe im staying in cambridge until the N nd so i will miss seeing your bird fly cheers 
 sometimes it just doesnt work out shame im at 
 as attractive as oily rags can be thursday is the one day during my brief stay in the area that the raf radar museum will be open to visitors me and missus were thinking of heading out to rent bikes in hoveton and ride around the broads a bit making sure to stop at the museum 
 hope the sun shines for you guys been pretty chilly lately with an unusual cold westerly wind thats been blowing for a month now i always get lost flying over the broads flat and featureless but the north sea coast is the clue to turn round 
 keep up the good work on the midway article 
 if we have got these guys permission though id love to see the highres version uploaded rather than just the mediumres 
 nice job on getting those permissions the license version you picked is probably what id put on it another option would be to put the {{
 morning nimbus you may still watching this page but since the discussion faded about N years ago i thought id let you know that i have a definition from the oed which citeably answers the question i have also proposed a tighter definition see what you think at

 wikiproject report would like to focus on wikiproject aircraft for a signpost article this is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to your efforts and attract new members to the project would you be willing to participate in an interview if so 
 done 
 just use the name for it like

 could you explain simply what the sockpuppet thing is i had thought that 
 mmcannis i just think you should answer the question on my talk page to help us out 
 thanks guys much appreciated 
 np it must have been the controversial school category work that you were doing that ticked him off lol 
 it stops the link working and allows the code to be seen without going into edit mode lots more at 
 no worries try 
 they are parts of the interstate highway system so yes highway should be capitalized as for the other list they are parts of the united states numbered highway system so yes highway should be capitalized highway in both cases is part of the full proper name 
 highway is not a proper noun so it should only be capitalized if it is part of a name interstate highway and us highway are not proper nouns because they refer to types of things not individual things 
 interstate highway N us highway N the name of the systems the eisenhower interstate and defense highway system the united states numbered highway system highway is a part of the proper name and all other similar lists are named this way 
 interstate highway N and us highway N are individual highways they are capitalized because those are names that identify an individual entity and thus proper nouns highway by itself is not a proper noun and adding qualifying terms to it does not make it proper either so highway long highway state highway interstate highway and us highway are all common nouns while yes you do capitalize the qualifying terms in some cases the base word highway remains uncapitalized 
 if you disagree take the issue to 
 uN 
 gary still working hard i see always loads to do as usual a few unfamiliar names wafting around amongst the regulars i notice and sadly still some id gladly shoot on sight but hey thats life all the best chum 
 just in case you didnt know we cant use another wp article to reference another one a lot of policy or guideline links to visit there but its better that you dont fall down a mineshaft at an early stage cheers 
 i was actually reverting his other edits but i was too lazy to do it manually i love the revert button 
 well you have to apply for adminship and when you get it you get all these neat tools which allow you to do certain things regular users cannot i got adminship on november N N the revert button is one of the best tools and comes with the privilege only i say you got enough experience and trust from plenty of users to apply for it but if you have any angry stints or your record is tainted by early vandalism or recent anger its best you not try it yet people want someone who they can trust with these tools seeing as they can do a lot of things but if you are up for it i can nominate you check it out 
 no its free so um tell me some more about yourself though like how long have you been here what achievements you have done etc 
 well you got a pretty good track record which is great but you havent been here N months yet so you may not get too much support though several users have become admins with less than that time you can figure out your wikiversary by going to my contributions and clicking earliest then seeing what your earliest edit is its most likely your first edit was done soon after you registered then six months after that date you can apply for adminship but until then try and do something big i for example cleaned up hundreds of airport articles and air crash articles helped come up with alongside wikiproject airports members the current standard format for airport articles and spent a long time cleaning up school articles but my largest contribution was the fact i turned 
 interesting to note the name of

 evening nimbusN got a problem with an edit you made to this article way back in jan N when you also added an info box i think you changed N aN to N ac according to jack ericksons compilation of manufacturers designations vs capacity at http or or homecomcastnet or ~aeroengine or franklinN html all N aN engines were oN s though not all oN s were N aN s but not all N ac engines were oN spanning oN to oN sorry to be an anorak there are some associated issues with the navbox and at least one redirect we could revert to rlandmans N aN or better extend the oN list to include more of the franklin designations of that capacity perhaps we need to decide if the title uses manufacturers name or the engine size at the moment we inconsistently have 
 i can understand why the article was moved because there are at least four sizes of six cylinder engines but only one oN and franklin N ac would align with the 
 would have to run jack eriksons list through 
 where did you hear nk was starting cix i have heard rumors of lim and pos but not cix 
 wow some of the rumors people have about this airline are crazy modelling after ryanair they talk as if thats the official adopted strategy and not an educated guess proposed further by the anet cabal im sure mnagements just tring to make a bit more cash it probably wont last too long either i do not know yet how they are going to manage all these flights with N gates of which none are owned by spirit and operate out of a terminal where N other airlines operate we are having so much trouble now with gates at fll its incredible i like the schedules they opted for though still id like to see spirit announce this firmly before we put anything up considering that airlines take the rights to routes all the time and never use them look at emirates and its bogota rights or alitalia and sydney it will probably never happen so lets keep it down until nk announces it and then we will have no reason to hold it back 
 i have been spending some time putting in citations and where they are not in any source i have putting in citation needed petebutt has been systematically removing these i think on the basis that blue links dont need cns though he does not ask or explain actually i need to look closer as it seems almost all the earlier ones have gone red or blue cns i will have another look in a while any thougts 
 follow up if you compare todays and yesterdays version on argus motoren as an example you will see what i mean all cns have gone from both red and blue links much good work undone 
 i have put a polite request on his page asking him to stop deleting cns and explaining why they are necessary pointed him to lists again on the engine discussion page to see what all this is about 
 i have added some thoughts at the engine list talk page i dont personally understand why any editor would want to work against this process might need to bring this to the attention of an admin if your note meets a negative response im currently very busy prepping for an overseas trip and will be away from any computer access between the N th and N rd of this month stick at it cheers 
 thanks for the supportive comments both here and on the list page i wish he would ask questions before shooting but we have a debate enjoy your retreat cheers 
 no worries i have just been looking at the other related list referencing discussion i noticed that 
 not sure if this 
 we do have 
 i just had a job interview and i have another one saturday two more im waiting word on so that should tell you something also read 
 us airways on monday airtran on saturday and im waiting on word from american eagle and southwest so yeah 
 us cause its at mia and i like right next to that airport while fll is N miles north i dont really mind id be happy anywhere else spirit was getting so hellish and crappy to work for i actually had my interview before they announced all this that just shows you how i felt about it this just confirms to me i must go asap before it all goes to hell for sure 
 i applied for ramp but they called me for customer service then they said it was a mistake and it was actually a ramp position and she said that i had so much customer service experience shed rather i be there so she said that she was going to check and see if theres a csa position open and if not theyd give me the ramp position and told me shed get back to me by friday im hoping they get back to me asap the suspense is killing me 
 oh definately i will thanks for listening most people here tend to not care beyond wikibusiness how old are you by the way 
 whenever i miss a full day here i end up annoyed because i know im going to be spending hours here fixing the problems i didnt fix on my daily route i have been here since december N N and actually i began editing in june of N as an anon for the most part though i cant seem to shake my obsession with this place it caters to my knowitallness im a huge knowitall a walking encyclopedia everyone says and dictionary sometimes i think i have 
 oh heh i got the job i just came from the drug test and im doing my fingerprints tomorrow and then after the fingerprints they are taking a photocopy of my passport and social security card for proof of citizenship im going to resign from spirit on friday but thats because thats the end of the pay period so if i give two weeks on friday then i will get a full paycheck after i go as of this morning im now with us airways at mia 
 sorry i forgot to notify you i was busy with work and such 
 was the above template just an aborted experiment was going to tfd it as unused and redundant but not sure if it would be better incorporating it into the wikibanner system 
 in that case i will leave it for now i agree that is seriously hairy which is why i have never touched the code iirc i know the feeling as regards totally undue drama when it comes to template stuff let me know if theres any movement on this 
 regards 
 i had a quick look at the hiro template we dont usually add documentation pages to these templates and i could not work out how to easily add it to 
 regards 
 no worries i have got a day before i go away to answer your first question about removing article cite banners its best left to an independent editor to remove them avoids the rat in charge of the cheese larder syndrome if you think an article that you created needs tags removing you can ask another editor no problem with that unless it is 
 some of this stuff is touched upon in the current article i have individual aircraft and pilot details plus the summary of the cause for all N writeoff accidents that occurred in german service to analyse that list would be 
 forgot to answer about my flying i have listed the types that i have flown 
 i have written and now verbal permission from both the historian or curator and assistant historian who have no problem with it being there i have within the past hour verified that permission to use the discription of the history of stephens city i will be readding that information posthaste 
 i do not see the verification you mentioned please do not readd the content again without verification of its copyright or licensing status (see 
 please forward your email via my email link and i will forward you the email i just recieved from them with the aforementioned permission 
 please see 
 it has been forwardedam readding in good faith 
 welcome back im sure you had a good break from normal life didnt realise its been two weeks since i posted the message above so you are fine with me going ahead with fN and lending me some support also you dont mind with reviewing 
 crikey no need to ask me or anyone else just crack on and we will see what happens im watching the article talk page so if you have any major plans it would be best to post them there i will have a look at the other two when i have unpacked cheers 
 i have cleaned up 
 and additional thanks for revising engine regards 
 no worries i was just doing a bit of 
 morning nimbus i wondered if as one who flew gliders you have anything citable on the last N years of scud N baN or galot im just rounding off an article on the scud N and there are two things id like to nail with decent refs first its often said that baN is the oldest bga glider but i cant find anything citable to back this claim second its certainly in the shuttleworth collection now but when did it get there w and r N ed says december N but martin simon says N there is an ab pic from N that puts it at dunstable so im doubtful about the earlier date but simon seems to be well regarded any thoughts or cites cheers 
 puts it at dustable in N either it was not then in the sc or it was flying under their ownership away from old warden 
 afraid i cant help much with that one i was going to say check w and r but you have done that already i went looking for my single copy of w and r but cant find it at the moment i have not noticed it at old warden and i have no photos of it there there is the showing registration in N it probably doesnt have a g reg now because of its age it would be treated as noneasa annex ii same as tiger moths are i do know after a recent inquiry that all the old bga archive is now with the they might be able to point to a book source for info on that particular scud im fairly close to old warden so next time im there i will seek it out and take a photo cheers 
 thanks anyway i have yet to find the bga register online another odd thing about the scud N bgaN is that at one time it carried the trigraph aaa though 
 i dont think there is an online bga register as a recently lapsed maintenance inspector i should have known about it the vgc would be the best place for info they have a forum where you could ask the right people cheers 
 excuse the 
 hey soxN i was looking at and i was curious do you keep track of updating the average age as well since each month the average age of the fleet gets N years older i wasnt sure how you were figuring this one out 
 cool i just wasnt sure how you were updating it i wanted to make sure we werent getting set up for a problem down the road thanks for your detailed edits on this 
 head over there now and accept or answer the questions 
 i suggest you withdraw try getting some more experience first 
 hope that is of interest 
 no worries i didnt actually check the wikilink i rarely believe anything that i read on wp nowadays no offence to the creator shame that its come to that though im not at all savvy with vintage gliders but there are real enthusiasts out there i have just been given an enormous pile of aviation books no glider stuff in them though 
 more no worries i have been called worse while you are here how do you redirect a duplicate article to two existing articles at the same time 
 dont think you can do you have an example 
 no i dont think you can either if you look at my contribs i found a duplicate article that was actually describing two types one had an article and the other is covered in a variants section i explained on the talk page theres lots of confusion with the mirage series one of the books i just got helps a lot 
 i like to include it but im pretty sure its not printed anywhere in that book its pretty old i suppose but plenty of books before that have isbns im gratefully receiving a large collection of aviation books in instalments i have nowhere to put them but needs must 
 hey soxN some pictures would be nice for the concourses in the 
 just one more thing what do you think we should do about incidents table 
 sure does help thanks 
 i have edited out many if not all of the material commented upon on the articles talk page it would now be quite easy to transfer the remaining sections into the existing hyper engine article i was quite concerned about the major rework necessary to revise the existing article with what material i thought was needed to revive it but i am now confident with the consensus of all concerned that i can manage that task would you please when you find a moment take a look at my edits and leave your comments regards 
 have commented 
 hi nimbusN according to you made 
 it is probably this from the date if not search the archives at 
 excellent thanks very much 
 a way round the problem would be to make 
 theres another discussion about it at 
 well i saw you started removing these from some of the sites im going through to help you now what do you think of the section at 
 hello soxN i have recently renominated 
 if you could get those pictures it would be great we have done alot with the midway airport article hopefully it will pay off 
 wow the pictures look great and thanks for fixing some of the refrences 
 midway has been put on hold but if changes are made soon it will become a ga 
 i am the reviewer for the midway airport article and would like to ask whether you need an extension on the hold for the ga nomination as it will expire in a day your recent work towards the article is good but it still needs more work before being passed let me know on my talk page by the end of tomorrow if you do want an extension 
 i am extending the hold and have written down what needs to be done on the articles talk page 
 i see that someone reverted your deletion of the table do you want me to delete it 
 i didnt like the the fact that the table still duplicated the two december N th incidents so i got rid of it myself i will pass the article in a day if no one disagrees with my edit otherwise we will have to come to another solution 
 hey ian i noticed that you have put a maybe on the 
 nice one sounds like we have a plan i will be arriving into picadilly station which is on the opposite side of town from victoria i think the waterhouse is about halfway between the two stations so thats probably the best place to meet my train gets in at N or N i was planning on getting the later one and going straight to the pub but if you really want i could get the earlier one and find you somewhere else cheers 
 you can probably read about that at 
 by the way sorry if i messed you up or caused you any confusion when you were editing the chicago midway international airport article [ 
 the issue with players contracts has been a bit of a mess this season when wilson turned up they decided to give all the players a fresh start so never published a list of released players there was only really kozluk and france out of contract anyway they decided to give kozluk an opportunity so retained his registration and apparently they are negotiating with france to try and get him to retire theres some stupid clause that means we have to keep him on the staff as long as hes injured unless he retires ludicrous though that is the others are still there as far as i know and will have numbers they will probably come to light following cup games etc so i reckon they should stay in the squad until theres some sort of confirmation that they have left 
 france will still be registered as a player thats the bit they will be trying to change by getting him to retire o by my reckoning any notable player at the club should be listed in the squad unless theres any indication that some of them have left (i dont think any have although gardos isnt very evident anywhere as for the number seven shirt i was assuming they are saving that for xavi when he comes 
 do you have an email address i need to speak with you in private 
 why cant you put it on my talk page 
 please study our 
 kurdoN what specific part of 
 i kurdo has reverted again should we try and get a N rd opinion 
 i have recieved permission from the authors of both and via email stating that i can use this on wikipediai dont know what else i need however i will be on vacation until saturday june N so i will not be able to respond 
 if substantial content is duplicated and it is not 
 i hope i have made enough changes and additions to original material to avoid any copyright violation 
 boogalouie has violated wikipedias copyright polices on many occasions by dumping large chunks of texts taken from copyrighted books into various articles he currently hosts several of these quotefarms on his subpage or subpages of discussions pages which are also a part of wikipedia and governed by wikipedia rules an admin should look into these pages which are being used essentially as a blog or povfork full of copyrighted text 
 not true have not dumping large chunks of texts taken from copyrighted books or violated wikipedias copyright polices on many occasions the alleged quotefarms on his subpage or subpages essentially as a blog or povfork such as are not acessable to the public but were created for wikipedia editors to help sort out issues in the highly contentious 
 with regards to the large chunks of texts mentioned by kurdoN while there are some exceptions made for the shortterm hosting of copyrighted material pages such as 
 have tried to decopyright infringe the 
 to be quite frank it doesnt matter that the quotes dont appear any other place on the internet the point is that they violate policy by being here and you could always set up a personal website to host them where all youd have to worry about is fair use and not wikipedias stricter requirements are there more of these quote or source pages than 
 no thats the lot i was hoping the situation at the N iranian coup article had changed and they would be useful for editing but if they violate regulations i wont put up a fuss about their deletion 
 thanks i will go ahead and blank them in case anyone wants to copy the information out of the page history in the next week or so and theres nothing wrong with keeping a copy of an article in your userspace as a sandbox to work on possible improvements 
 if the personal attacks dont stop i suggest you take the editor to 
 please do 
 thanks 
 i didnt know about it either until today and it didnt belong on the expressjet page anyway my mistake thanks for the help i have moved it to the continental express page 
 i saw this pop up on my watchlist i should say that i was the first one to make a page like that and i totally disagree that its against policy there was a vast failure to agree on reality between several posters on the iranian coup page as in people were saying book x supports my position i actually bothered to go and read the same books and found this to be incorrect merely saying that didnt help so i copied those pages directly for use as possible sources this still didnt matter as kurdo and others continued to insist that despite what the sources said right there they actually said something else i eventually gave up and stopped paying attention however if active debate is still going on in the talk page i believe these resources are useful to give a baseline of reality to the discussions i cant attest to boogalouies additions and whether they were pov or not but i went in to reading the books with an open mind and i can say for myself that the communism sources page was not in any way meant as blog or povpushing but rather to show the reality of the source and make it harder to dance around it 
 exactly my take on it snowfire the sources were assembled for the purpose of improving the article in the same way that a userspace sandbox would be i see no reason to blank the pages 
 i have absolutely no opinion on the pov or blog comment but those pages are large chunks of copyrighted content which is against policy to leave sitting around indefinitely anywhere userspace or otherwise regardless of their purpose as i said above a personal webpage could easily be created elsewhere for the content which wouldnt be subject to wikipedias nonfree content policies 
 i think its premature to add routes to a map that dont begin for several months especially those that are still pending government approval im thinking of frontiers sanmzt service specifically 
 it just seems to me to have an as of date in the caption that is so far in the future unlike the list of airlines where it states explicitly that mzt starts dec N there is nothing in the map itself that indicates that it looks like you are using flightmemory to create the maps and i havent seen any way to change colors but perhaps if the future routes were a different color im really not sure what the best way to go is really i think a good rule of thumb is if an airline is selling tickets for a route then its ok to put on the map maybe we should post on the project talk page to get other opinions 
 hey hope you dont mind me using some similar sections in my user page i really like the way you layed everything out 
 haha did you explain to them how this isnt a free advertising website for them soxN 
 yup im a pilot and im surprised it took you looking at my user page to notice lol thats great that you want to learn to become a pilot i goto 
 thats not a stupid question its not the most common known degree but it is called aeronautical science it it sometimes refered to as professional pilot at erau it includes your flight training simulator training and ground training ground courses include your basic piloting skills as well as multiple aeronauticalspecific classes such as turbines systems and components international navigation flight technique fms avionics metorology and others of course you also have to take the core classes such as math science language or communicationrelated and some other stuff feel free to ask any other questions 
 thats great your score looks fine thats not the only thing they take into account though they also look at your gpa extracurricular activities references and other info you put on your application speaking of whch if you plan to apply i recommend doing it soon early application cutoff is sometime in december of this year if you get it in before then you will have a real advantage for one you have less competion second you know way ahead of time that you are set for college and third you get a $N grant each semester for filing early so if you can get it in as soon as possible let me know how it goes and if you have any more questions feel free to ask you can also im me if you want my screen names are listed above in my first post justin 
 boogalouie your reply to binksternet regarding working on the lead i thought was understandable i dont have an opinion on the content dispute though i am reading through the discussion and find it quite interesting what do you think do you and the other involved editors intend to keep working on the paragraph of the lead in question cheers 
 well im glad you find it interesting and i definately intend to keep on working on the article but i want to do this the wikipedia way so right now im inclined to work on the main body of the article before working on the lede specifically adding information on the military involvement in the coup to the and execution of operation ajax section 
 yes i do intend to read the discussion and hopefully be able to contribute something the lede should be rewritten at some point no doubt i will see you around cheers 
 boogie are you allowed to close the previous rfc you put up i think its better if only one is displayed on the rfc noticeboard page dunno if you agree 
 i just went through two weeks worth of oag online timetables there is not one single erjN shown as serving the stlden market under the united code its all blojets crjN s and mainline N s 
 and we are both right and both wrong in one of the more bizarre scheduling quirks i have ever seen trans states erjN s are flying as uax denstl but not back from stl to den where on earth are they coming in from maybe theres a magic embraer factory at den 
 or something similar is that factually true collect wants to make that statement explicitly right heh im learning a lot about the coup cheers 
 thanks will make changes 
 if you changed heavily fortified to defended how would you feel i know you are trying hard here and i respect that a lot sorry i keep coming here and suggesting you compromise i will try to work on collect and kurdosN as well the general gist of your proposed changes in terms of more detail of the actual coup is something i think other editors have stated is important so if some of the smaller objections can be dismissed maybe the larger picture can be addressed screw the lede editors opposed to you can always go thats not what the main body says right now and so i think it distracts from your main points thanks for your work on this really 
 thats not heavily fortified i just think this is a bit absurd but i will do it 
 yeah i keep suggesting changes for you to make in the hope that we can the move on past a specific objection and get the bulk of what you propose inbut that obviously aint happening your citations all seem good and i havent seen any that dispute them i do like graemes point and think it would be even better if we could mention that as the possibility of a coup became apparent preparations were made at mosaddeqs house dunno if the time frame for that was sometime around the N th and could be put in that section i assume if mosaddegh had been warned of the plot i assume he then organized resistance accordingly you are being a trooper cheers to you 
 also your civility on that talk page has been exemplary 
 no problem however you prolly shouldnt put you are in the process of being blocked on the page i have banned him for N hours but if he starts up again report him and state that he did it after a previous block and we can reinstate it for a longer period 
 i know it can be annoying but please do not get into edit wars with other users if he reverts you you revert him nothing gets done call in a thirdy party 
 hi soxN 
 many thanks i have already deleted the entry from the article but you might want to look at the articles talk page 
 agree with your wtf about the category but as long as it exists it will have to stay there in compliance with wikis childcategory conventions i strongly urge you to nominate the category for deletion if you do so let me know i will support it 
 can you nominate it then i am not sure how to nominate categories as opposed to articles it seems clear it was just created in order to score points in the ongoing debate on that talk page 
 im not sure how to do that either i will ask 
 it has been 
 good gave my vote 
 use of the word apartheid to describe the government of bahrain is now so frequent and coming form people of such stature that i believe it ought to be a freestanding page will you have a look at it if i put it up 
 great feel free to edit
 the comment to your recent edit to the number sign article seems to imply that the intent of the big tag was to overcome a browser deficiency perhaps it was put there for emphasis in either case i think your edit is an improvement 
 the preceding edit summary made clear that the editor was attempting to work around a bug in his browser or font setup 
 also is unknown the standard if so i will probably send 
 yes please see 
 your recent edits to 
 thanks for your explanation all i asked was that you check the date and you not only did that you explained why you used it perfect thanks mate 
 thanks 
 there was none since 
 was lvhis breaking the brd cycle there 
 hi magog the ogre i originally planned to post this in the section brd on si of this page but am just surprisedly aware that there has been a big word wall there already so i am posting my enquiry here that is for me to avoid to break the brd cycle indeliberately again i and other editors have had discussions on the changes as mentioned by john smiths above in the section leas section of that 
 yes that should be fine the d has been satisfied in the cycle bringing it back to b but if you are red remember to continue to d before b 
 sure thanks 
 in the very specific context lvhis alone is responsible for creating 
 hi magog the ogre tenmei made a r on august N pushing us to d and now the d is still ongoing but not yet finished while tenmei made an edit on the lead section of this page was tenmei breaking the brd cycle here 
 the significant investment in better quality inline citation support was exactly the kind of thing lvhis encouraged me to undertake 
 no i dont believe he was breaking the brd cycle because he was not reverting anything he was boldly making a change even if it wasnt particularly popular and qwyrxian reverted it 
 if you look at the left and right side of the diff it appears tenmei reverted lvhis changes to the intro and then proceeded to add apply his own rewording at the same location i dont really see how this isnt breaking the brd if what he did is allowed then i suppose someone can indefinitely circumvent your brd policy by doing a major rewrite or rewording on the same topic after each revert 
 well its all two consecutive edits there were no changes in between tenmei reverted lvhis and then made another edit without himself being reverted which i would qualify as bold this bold edit was of course undone by qwyrxian i dont see the edit as being any more bold than lvhis now if someone had undone tenmeis original revert and he had inserted the above material then yes i could see this being a brd violation 
 hopefully not hopefully we can move beyond that stage just as is done in cases with page protection 
 i have responded to everyones concerns at 
 this has to be the first time wikipedia has influenced a ceo to change his corporate website for the pure purpose of having a true source that can be used in wikipedia so that the article can meet his standards and still follow our guidelines shows how much the influence of wp is having on everyday society we everyone a barnstar ha ha 
 just wondering does your brd policy apply to talk page edits i collapsed a subthread started by tenmei because it is not constructive he then reverted and added another chunk of nonconstructive text i would like to collapse his text again because it is lengthy distracting and offers nothing of value but a wikilawyer may come in and advocate a page ban if you dont care then id go right ahead 
 if you think that he has started a topic not worth continuing i suggest pulling in a neutral administrator (such as myself or 
 i think i will just sit back let others argue with him you are welcomed to take a look at the stuff he wrote if you want to deal with this mess in case you dont already know his attitude is the main reason for the recent mediation case to be closed 
 citing idioms like two way street both parties are at fault and it takes two to start is not very helpful because it tends to trivialize the nature of the disputes while we both know that i am definitely not the nicest person in the world there are some people in this world that are next to impossible to reason with for example numerous parties had already made similar or identical appeals regarding his posts in fact i have made such a request twice already in that very conversation 
 this is a problemwhichdidnotneedtobeaproblem simply trying to overlook 
 more practical questions have to do with figuring out how to comply with feezos leadership guidance and structured mediation plans 
 this is a problemwhichdidnotneedtobeaproblem simply trying to overlook 
 discussion forums such as the airlinersnet forums are not considered 
 this particular case looks more like an internal email rather than a press release the thing is on a forum site anyone could just make something up if a press release was posted link to that hosted on the companys site or a reliable news site like yahoo msnbc cnn etc rather than to the thread with the press release on airlinersnet 
 ps i uploaded a better version of pedro iis N painting i have noticed that the older one which you used as template for a better version had a yellowish tone in it could you turn its background white as you did before sorry for taking your time regards 
 thank you very much jim i really appreciate what you have done there kind regards 
 instead of telling phoenix to call the chair i believe feezo should be more than equipped to explain clearly to him exactly why that wasnt canvasing and why phoenix was being irrational 
 bobthefishN no there is a difference between 
 if hed left it at accusing you of canvassing i would have done so but saying that i cannot mediate the case constitutes rejecting of the mediator which calls for outside intervention according to policy 
 interesting you collapsed a completely harmless post i have made and decided to make such a long post to deride my contributions i am curious to see what this is going to lead to without commenting on the phony logic 
 it appears tenmei has now taken it upon himself to collapse other peoples posts despite them not being offtopic and that the authors have objected to his actions i am not going to editwar with him over this but it is still something to highlight 
 please tenmei take out those comments from the collapsed box because i wish to reply 
 i do agree that tenmei should relocate his personal attacks somewhere else if he wants to brag about the enormous amount of time he spent making N + wikiedits vs my usertenmei or trophy_room so that others can go over and celebrate his tremendous accomplishments 
 bobthefishN i will not respond to any further diffs which seek to expand this in our talk page venue 
 stsc stop i simply 
 you did not state whether you support or oppose at 
 dont rush me im still thinking about it and nbspuN 
 feel free to support or oppose at 
 mediation needs to be a selffulfilling exercise rather than a selfdestructive one 
 a friendly reminder you forgot to count the number of words you used in each sentence 
 thats not a friendly reminder you could call it mockery sarcasm baiting or any number of equally unfriendly things but it comes to the same thing please dont do it 
 hmm feezo what about the comments like diversion tactics missiles is bobthefishN s term a spin introduced to denigrate and marginalize surely these are much less friendly than my reminder in fact they appear to be very public denunciations what do you think 
 it wasnt a reminder see my comments on the code sub page for my views on tenmeis writing style 
 a reminder is an act that serves to notify someone of some concept that he may have forgotten about you still have not replied to my question by the way thats also a reminder 
 i think both of you could stand to be a little nicer to each other 
 i do have pretty thick skin so i usually dont take exception to sharp things pointed at me the same obviously doesnt hold true over at the other end though 
 my apologies i have crossed out those words 
 from a 
 i fail to see why his biography would be a coatrack 
 kendrickN you need to listen to what the admins are communicating to you 
 meh no reason for me to start now im sure the janitors will sort this all out eventually 
 you are being uncivil this a collaborative project one should act responsibly and not expect people to clean up after you 
 hello soxN i have just recently returned to wikipedia after a very busy month and have been wondering if it is time to prep 
 i think its mainly references there are some formatting issues but i can take care of those 
 thanks for the help i am going to adjust some formatting issues now or tommorow 
 an important step in addressing our problems is simply acknowledging them 
 its really up to magog to decide whether or not i committed streategic fraud and that i am a toxic longterm warrior p in case he hasnt noticed tenmei had very swiftly deleted magogs advisory comment in his talk page already 
 tenmei can you summarize that it takes 
 the harms caused by this kind of strategic fraud are cumulative 
 i dont really need to address this very 
 bobthefish please stop antagonizing id appreciate if you didnt respond to anything tenmei says on my page if i want you in i will ask you 
 i was thinking that most of the files in are probably copyrighted derivative workswanted a second opinion before i went to the effort of a mass deletion request 
 yeah those look nonfree to me let me know if you need help tagging all the images with the deletion tag i have use of autowikibrowser on commons and i use i for that purpose or you could just apply for usage yourself 
 man im discovering that commons is lousy with copyrighted product packaging there are thousands of them i think i am awbchallenged if i start compiling a list perhaps you could eventually turn awb loose on it 
 i could yes but i will need to know which deletion discussion to link to which file i can even start a deletion discussion if you want and because im handy with 
 yeah i will probably just start compiling a list in my userspaceit will probably take a while i wanted to finish moving coolcaesars images over to commons first its likely to be contentious i have tagged a few of these images on wikipedia and commons both and people are already getting emotional about it rather than writing fair use rationales i will never find all the copyrighted images at one whack but i guess we can deal with them in batches 
 unfortunately they can get pretty snippy at commons its a very toxic atmosphere at times i think it might partially be due to cultural differences in communication and norms but i have gotten a bit sick of it myself 
 there are several pairs of pictures that are currently identical on this page including the two that your bot attempted to conflate but they actually represent different entities it is distinctly possible that at a later date these images will be updated to indicate distinguishing characteristics so they need to be retained as distinct files and distinct names is there any way to block or warn bots like yours that the current status is not accidental 
 that was more of a human factor than it was a bot factor originally 
 i am the uploader and its not an error like i said they represent two completely different script entities that are distinguished only by the direction they are written and they need to be two separate files so that when someone uploads new versions that actually show the subtle difference say an arrow to show the direction of the stroke you dont have the new image showing in the wrong place i need to know how to keep people like you who dont know the backstory that even though the images are currently identical they absolutely should not be substituted for each other how can i port images over to commons and mark them so they wont be removed like this i tried before and gave up because i couldnt navigate the commons process 
 i just did it for you as that was easier see 
 i belive brega shouldnt be blue anymore but green since it has been confirmed by the rebels themselves that they had been holding positions N kilometers from the town since the battle ended a week ago were only on the eastern and southern aproach to the town the west is still an open supply route for the loyalists there are over N loyalists in the town the top rebel commander commanding the front there has been killed and following his death the rebels have retreated today an additional N kilometers from the town so in essence they are N kilometers from the town now only N kilometers closer than they were before the battle all the information has come directly from rebel commanders on the frontline 
 which page are you maintaining is incorrect 
 the main map of the civil war which shows all of the towns under loyalist or rebel control 
 i will work on it later if its still not changed real life calls me at the moment 
 ironically it would seem immediately after i posted this question i noticed the subsection directly above mine so now it is moot 
 heh i also left a note on the talk page with a fuller explanation 
 and its been deleted 
 the notice which one gets when one goes to edit the article says that ips and new editors cant edit the article i think that this is incorrect or outdated if you agree could you fix thanks sincerely northN ( 
 ooh that unprotection slithered back in i think its worth a try i have edited the page notice let me know if i missed anything or if the vandalism becomes a problem 
 this edit] you blocked a couple of weeks ago i sent it to cci and someone else commented that some of these pictures may be ok due to a family connection i really do not know how to handle this thoughts 
 at this point im a bit aghast too hes not communicating very well either my suggestion is to open a thread at 
 still having problems and i suspect that they are also editing while logged out few if any of the contributions have an edit summary and they are not responding to my comments on their talk page commons apparently only has one recent uploaded image i think that this is now bordering on disruptive editing the user alleges to be a doctor of some sort so the lack of communication is just silly 
 ok thanks it struck me yesterday that perhaps the issue could be that the contributor is in fact one of the faces shown behind the article subject in the photo and that this might be the objection however they have never said that and have uploaded what must be a dozen variants now without appearing to learn a thing will see what happens next 
 on one hand i would feel awful about that on the other this is a place with rules as is the real world with its copyrights and we really have a moral obligation to uphold them 
 after you semiprotected 
 you will want to encourage the editor to use the talk page if the editor continues to revert war without using the talk page i will block him or her for disruptive editing 
 why not just have your user page protected may seem drastic but not in comparison to chrisN s blocking of thousands of ips and yes the eejit will move on to another but it will give you a break all the best 
 because the vandal pulls pauls user contributions then runs around pooping on those not just the user page protecting all those is maybe less drastic than blocking tiscali but still thats a lot of pages 
 you guys dont deserve this but nor do all the blocked users i agree that these are not longterm solutions but they might make your life easier in the shortterm on the vandals get bored principle semiprotection would also have the advantage that it can be discussed article by article whereas blocking ips from editing or email or new accounts means the very people affected cannot comment on it 
 thanks for the bit of sympathy we have been getting little enough of it i sure do wish there were other tools this guy is not likely to get bored based on experience so far the other big problem is that the vandal also has been seen using open proxies and blocking those affects editors or users in china so who ya gonna call 
 hi can you have a look at the historical licensing information for 
 so it was the same uploader both times the second of which he claimed as that said 
 i am responding here because i cannot seem to recall my password to the commons project this is in reference to the file on the subject this file has been nominated to deletion by you as per the sri lanka public domain brief in wikimedia i disagree on the reasons you have given for deletion though it is the national anthem that is written by ananda samarakoon it doesnt necessarily mean he has copyrights over it he was commissioned by the government of sri lanka to write the national anthem moreover the national anthem is part of the constitution and it cannot have copyrights 
 i will leave a note on the commons page indicating your belief in this you might consider registering another account on commons or resetting your password as well i am going to further respond there if you want to respond here instead of creating a new account feel free 
 on the article talk page i have been deleting his comments from the history let me know if you want me to do that on your user or talk pages 
 thanks for the offer tom but i will decline for now the history may be useful for the nonce 
 good close i had actually thought about making the same argument about how the news event was months ago but since no one seemed to want to continue the discussion i just kept it in the quiver and i hadnt thought about the montage argument either 
 only one section at a time please 
 hi magog the ogre is the sanction 
 bottom line the significant investment in better quality inline citation support deserves encouragement 
 tenmei you did not quote what i said entirely at there i also said and here that meant i will deal with you later because your usually outoffocus way needs to spend more time as an expectation here is magog the ogres talk page let magog the ogre make his decision on this brd cycle breaking you and i shall not argue each other about this here 
 i dont agree that your contributions alone are feeding the conflict while i think your means of communication is a problem i dont think its the ultimate source of conflict of course i could be wrong so withdrawing could be one way to test the hypothesis i will let you know privately if i suspect any foul play but i seriously doubt that will happen 
 i was almost going to ask what on earth the point of this was until i came to i know its a bit late just in case you need some more helpful links thanks mac in the meantime i have updated the 
 i love the idea but we should probably pick a less maleoriented image im sure our female contributors keep the sand clean now and again as well im a little busy translating an article right now so sorry if i dont respond immediately oh and thanks for awarding me of course blush 
 incidentally im still very much a newbie is there an accepted policy for responses on talk pages i noticed you moved my comment to here and now my natural inclination is to copy this entire thing back to your page as well is that sort of sane or do people generally keep it to one page 
 ok thanks for all that to prevent confusion i will remove the remnants of the original discussion from your page keeping just my initial question and mdashi think thats the least redundant and wont clutter up your already cluttered page anyhoo i plan on restyling my user page one of these days so maybe i will fit in the award somewhere on second thought i will probably put it on a subpage because flaunting awards distracts from the actual content oh look at the time id better go catch some zs thanks again and goodnight or whatever it is over on your time zone 
 if you got it flaunt it is my thought its a brand new award you are one of the first to get it and awards are great for your user page they let people know what other editors think about you if you had like N or more awards and it took up too much room or something that might need a subpage i forgot to mention if you put something on another users talk page i think the custom is to leave it there for the other editor to delete or archive im not picky about my page though im picky only about articles i like to leave most of my recent discussions on my talk page because they let other users get to know something about each other and what i think about another user there is a move to make it so that only a user can edit their own user page but i like it being open i wouldnt say something anywhere on wikipedia or its sister articles that i wouldnt want to show up in a google search anyway nice to meet you and thanks for helping to discourage bad sandbox content 
 thank you for keeping eye on my talk page and rescuing from deletion articles which suffered from editing by nonexperienced editors 
 i loved your retaliatoryhomemadeflowertemplate it made me laugh 
 yes it was funny but please dont disrupt wikipedia to make a joke or a point and mdash 
 on the bright side 
 hahah yeah no harm done at all we can all use a laugh every now and then and mdash 
 that was your article sorry bout that i was much too serious well as soon as i learnt how to suggest deletion i forgot it i cant be bothered to relearn the process so potential authors of exploding males exploding weals etc are safe from me i now see about ten articles per day that i think should be deleted but ignore eight of them and simply advocate speedy deletion for those whose vacuousness is so stunningly obvious that even the most fanatic of inclusionists wouldnt defend it boringly yours 
 hi for some time i thinking improving lithuania article as it is rather huge job more editors needed i ask renata to help so far no response in any case would you be willing to help 
 well of course if you preoccupied with upcoming easter we can wait a bit no problem take your time 
 hi i moved the mfd to 
 thanks i kind of figured i was doing it wrong 
 any time take care 
 you seem to be the only sane person in the ongoing afd discussion re above you might have noticed theres a rescue flag on the current afd how about taking it onboard 
 many thanks for your quick response contents noted your comments at afd discussion page are helpful i will bear them in mind when reworking edit best regards 
 i dont understand theres no way we can put every bit of vandalism into bjaodn why was what i did wrong 
 my bad my bad i was misreading the edit history i thought a genuine editor had put nonsense in an anon took it out and you had to put it back in again that would have been truly surreal only two mistakes out of three actions not a bad track record for me anyway carry on 
 if you are going to move the fort dearborn article please also go through and update 
 are you working on the article i will give you a hand 
 i was just wondering if you could clarify this for me why would turkey care about the way in which poland was partitioned and why would either the germans or the soviets care what they thought unfortunately google books does not allow me to preview the cited page if you have the book would you mind quoting the cited passage or just the gist of it if you dont have the book to hand 
 replied at article talk page 
 this is a courtesy note that i moved your post 
 no problem 
 i think i am finished rewriting the article would you be so kind to work your copyediting magic please let me know if you think something needs additional citations after working on it for a week i am not seeing anything any longer i am thinking of nominating it for ga once i get a couple maps done for it 
 great thank you 
 hi thank you so much for granting me rollback rights since i am new to this i may have to check the diff with popups or something before i use it if i think there is a chance it isnt vandalism i will either not revert use popups or use the undo or edit links in the diffs i frequently notice vandalism in my watchlist so i think it should be quite helpful however i cant seem to quite grasp the idea of how it could revert subsequent edits by a single user if someone has editted after that or something well i have to go now thanks ~
 you are welcome good luck 
 apparently you an i are sockpuppets of each other one of our anon troublemakers of late has discovered a brand new administrative page it seems 
 yeah i noticed he even templated my page my first instinct was to just let the checkuser run its course watch the anonip eat some crow and then move on but on second thought this isnt his first attempt at harassment and personal attacks so i may end up biting back 
 would you be so kind to point which of the N unesco pages informs about damelis 
 i think this is better done at the article talk page will reply there 
 thanks for catching that i guess N years ago when i just started my wiki adventure i was still not very clear on close paraphrasing i will be more than happy to fix other such instances but i dont think there should be many left years ago i tried to revisit my older contribs and fix those that i realized where too close to the original but if you have time you are more then welcome do double check them 
 i dont believe that there are more than few sentences or paragraphs in some of my oldest articles i always rewrited content in some old cases not sufficiently indeed i dont believe there is a need to waste others time trying to find those few sentences particularly since most of them have been corrected already either intentionally by me or by others as old content from N has often been rewritten anyway i am currently double checking my old entries of weber now that you reminded me of the source i might have used but most of them seem fine anyway if you think that the problem may be significant and you think that there is indeed a need to review tens of thousands edits of mine from that period id strongly suggest to see what moonriddengirl thinks before we waste time of other editors 
 long time no see could you head over and take a look at 
 this is already being discussed on 
 thanks more elaborate thanks on 
 re assuming you are done mark sorry i left on there for so long i was in fact basically done 
 is this reliable source how king sigismund could sponsor academy founded in N kazimierz lew sapieha was not a marshal of the crown but court marshal of lithuania lithuanians at the time comprised about one third of the students others were germans poles swedes and even hungarians its not true lithuanians at the time comprised about one third because poles comprised twothirds 
 are you speaking of the 
 i collapsed the discussion because its literally the same arguments as 
 im sure the afd will be reopened eventually if needed the arguments have actually progressed because the issue now is not deleting the article but removing syn and renaming if necessary censoring that discussion is unproductive and if an abusive editor is reported to an or i the solution is to discuss it with and or or sanction the editor not to censor the discussion on talk i dont think i have ever seen an active discussion closed down because of an editor before 
 by the way the two links you give are certainly illustrative of your point those are not serious edits but you censored the entire discussion not just the anon ips drivebys theres a lot more there again the big problem here is the synthesis violation but if you believe wikipedia policies in this regard are a lie im not sure what i can do about that 
 i have changed my username for a reason and i was perfectly within my rights to do so i expect you to respect it 
 i see from this thread that two admins both of whom have i think participated in eastern european issues are aware of the name change neither seems to have requested that you publicly connect the old and new accounts i defer to their judgment 
 additionally i would appreciate it if you have found something else to do other than wiki stalk my edits as you seem to be doing over at 
 we have both aired our points of view about the hounding issue now id like to see solicitation of outside opinions as the next step wikiquette alerts might be a place to start 
 looks like i have screwed the pooch check 
 thanks jrm you have no idea how much time i wasted surfing around trying to figure out how to do this on my own i would say the doctor page is the dominate meaning of dr regardless of drs capitalization followed by disaster recovery if you are interested please take a look at my current endeavor 
 hi novickas i hope you are doing fine it has been quite a long time since we last time discussed the fac nomination of the 
 hi novickas the fac procedure is still going on and it seems that there is still a long way to go unfortunately due to very personal issues in the real life i will be not able to edit wikipedia for a week or so regarding the fac procedure this is a very inconvenient timing but there is nothing i can do about this i hope you will be around to keep your eye on the fac procedure and will react if anything needs to be fixed thank you in advance 
 thank you very much for responding to caslibers comments 
 congratulations on helping to improve 
 you know i have always assumed someone has asked for it to be fixed but i have never really checked perhaps its on bugzilla somewhere 
 out of interest i went and found it 
 thanks for intervening in my disputebut the humour him in your message on his talkpage i have to say i find rather offensive as far as i remember im not a 
 ok you are forgiven 
 a clarifying comment would be appreciated as he seems not to understand 
 im sorry i apparently was not clear in what i thought communicat did not understand he attributes the comment that his work is valuable to tony judt while it appears in your psot that it is your comment and not a comment from professor judt 
 ah but then you dont need me for that you can post relevant parts of the afd sorry i dont want to get involved in the dispute resolution 
 well since communicat often misunderstands what i write i thought you could tell him exactly what you wrote he believes the late professor complimented him because he read your post incorrectly 
 againsorryi know dispute resolution is painful and extra eyes or comments helpbut the discussion is taking place at an admins talk page im confident that he along with other participants and page watchers can evaluate the evidence 
 ok its not particularly important sorry to have bothered you 
 oops i didnt realize talkpage discussions worked back and forth like that thanks for the info 
 cool exclamation marks make something more important yaaaaaaaay look at me very important 
 yes im quite aware that the term is more than a little insulting and there are people who dont appreciate this kind of humor my basic belief is that if people dont have a sense of humor thats their problem i sort of object to this notion that contributors no matter how bad should be encouraged to contribute more no matter what as long as they are not obvious vandals i think people who pile fancruft into wikipedia need not be encourgaed to do so im not saying they need to be actively discouraged from contributing but its no major loss if and when they stop i think the term also serves as a warning to everyone to be careful what you wish for anyway i imagine i wont use the term much or for long just until i feel i have made my point id also like to point out that i dont consider this term a personal attack just an attack on content oh and i liked the vandal acronym is that yours 
 i do know the term is insulting i wont pretend i came up with the words and then suddenly thought gosh looks what that spells but i still maintain that you can insult someones work without insulting that person in fact it happens all the time a comment like awful article delete is just a nicer way of saying the same thing any criticism of any work is not tantamount to a personal attack and as for it being a joke well most jokes are jokes on people they have a subject of ridicule as does this sure its a little harsh bit thats a matter of degree anyway as i said i came up with the term to make a point and i think the point is being made though in all likelihood all i will accomplish is to sabotage any hope i may have had of ever being made admin though thats hardly a bug deal i wouldnt want to pander anyway well off to sharpen my horns take care 
 nice i should have hired you to come up with my fecal acronym i bet you would have found something a bit better anyway you have my permission to use that as you like without inflicting insult hope it doesnt defeat the purpose 
 hello acalamari i saw that you have changed my user rights from to autoreviewer but im unfamiliar with this terms i mean is there any significant change for me now thank you 
 you were on 
 ok thanks for the clarification 
 hi long time no see yes i suppose the article could become ga i am personally not too happy about it there is something missing for my complete satisfaction but i know my personal quality standards a way higher than wikipedias could you sprinkle your magic with copyedits 
 sorry i just realized that i only replied to you in my head yeah sounds good please do the copyedit and nomination just note that i wont be around much until april N due to the dreary tax season i hope you are handling the winter ok 
 so by defining those four variables you can either define a common policy for all vfd polls or you can alternatively let the people to vote both their poll option and the above N variables then by using the 
 this is the meaning of my strange votes i dont want all vfd polls to have the same policy i think that every vfd poll should have its own policy that depends on what it is actually written on the article a vanity article deserves a different vfd policy than a nonsense article for example and of course i dont wont to force people to follow the policy that i think is correct for a specific article thats why i put my proposed policy into a poll along with my poll option if you think my position is funny i also think the same 
 hi could you look into 
 honestly thats one article where i am out of ideas what to do i dont i was ever this stuck i completely defer to your judgment 
 hi could you put the name of the article you are nominating in the edit summary when you update 
 you will miss a lot of vfds doing that unless you refresh your watchlist a lot i assumed it was a remnant of when vfd wasnt so busy i will start doing it again but i may try and get it removed or made optional later as im not really sure its worth the effort considering the method of monitoring vfd it creates is less than optimal and vfd is complex enough as it stands 
 it is optional thats what the as a courtesy is supposed to mean nobodys going to haul you in for an rfa if you dont do it re missing a lot not really as i do refresh my watchlist a lot to me its preferable to loading vfd a lot and mdash my browser is unusable for several seconds while its just rendering the page re not worth the effort ok if its too much typing then dont as i said nobodys forcing you perhaps i should have amended it to as a completely optional courtesy to 
 ah but theres optional and optional courtesy is optional here at wikipedia but that doesnt mean id consider myself having the option of not being courteous anyway i will have a think about what to do about this maybe i will just have a does anybody apart from jrm actually use this poll as for dragging people to 
 hmm your problem is rendering time not load time lynx might render slightly faster but i think the ui will just slow things down even further are you sure you dont have some misconfiguration or other software problem even on older machines vfd takes only half a second to render for me 
 nice work 
 thanks too bad so much is behind paywalls 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or thanks for your awesome work rescuing 
 yes the possibility of studentonstaff bullying really ought to be mentioned incidentally i am working on the related 
 thanks for the invitecant promise anything always torn in several directions it looks like a reasonable start on a brighter note that tas name came back to me i googled it and he has N book mentions several agency directorships so he thrived anyway later 
 forgive my ignorance ta is what incidentally 
 sorry ta is an acronym for 
 just worked it out half a minute ago by refreshing my memory of what you wrote on my talk page the distinction between school v academia is clearer in the uk where school students are called pupils but more confusing in the us where they are all called students 
 you are absolutely right that latter is now sometimes used to refer to a set of three or more items but a lot of native english speakers think its just a fancysounding form of last which is a pet peeve of mine i felt a little rude editing someone elses user page but you say to right up at the top so i figured id be bold im glad you appreciated my input thanks for letting me be a grammar nazi on your page it certainly is a strange feature of the language to have adjectives for one two and many items 
 frank you have my sympathies being a vandalhunting admin is a thankless job are you sure you wouldnt rather mediate disputes ah who am i kidding you probably live for this right 
 actually i did offer my services to the medcom but by the looks of it they are going to politely decline but yes this does constitute a mildly entertaining evening on wikipedia by my books much more pleasant than the usual barrage of povpushers 
 hi novickas thank you for your time and efforts working on this unfortunately im unable to participate anymore but i know that you guys will work something out and the naming disputes will be just a bad memory all the best and good luck 
 you are more optimistic than i am a happy quality best of luck to you too 
 to jacurek i dont see why you couldnt participate there the discussion is about the general nature of naming guidelines just dont mention anything related to eastern europe 
 i will ask for clarification and permissioni think you are right volunteer marek anyway novickas be optimistic as well with a little bit of a good fate and open minded approach an agreement can be reached im sure about that 
 hi jrm remember me a while back you helped me on a disambiguation page for the acronym dr i finally finished the completed draft of 
 thanks for the review i will post the 
 thanks for the correction should know better its late here thats my excuse steve 
 my dsl is fine but im planning to cut back a little anyway im guessing the channel will get along fine without us 
 hi smalljim thanks for reviewing antoinette for dyk thought i should also mention that i have stuck clotted cream up for good article status since i thought we did a pretty decent job of it anything else you want to add or tweak nows a good time cheers 
 my pleasure i will see if i can find any more creamy stuff but i think i exhausted my refs last time btw i spotted your dyk after i added my first one 
 oh yes i meant to say i read that this morning and good job 
 dry as the dust on his tomb id say still its all good writing practice and nbspuN 
 its not that bad plus you have got a very hooky hook out of it always good to get an exeter article improved 
 i think it may be eligible i hope you find the dyk acceptable but please feel free to propose an alt 
 k i also added a cite request for a claim you added i think you are correct but this is an important point that needs to be cited 
 this is an automated notice by 
 i withdrew it from fac 
 so i thought that the compromise for the naming thing was that nonlithuanian names could go into a separate section rather than the lede which is what i did here but now we have got 
 can you understand why this request is offputting your edit summary is a strong hint that the lt editors you mention above are sockpuppeting as vycius N edit summaries cant be redacted but you could in effect do it here i truly dislike hints and allegations particularly when they are posted at user talk pages and i think you have been here long enough to know how to file formal sockpuppet investigations have you considered posting to vycius N s talk page yourself that is the first step in 
 you are inferring something that i didnt imply anyway feel free to ignore that aspect and concentrate on the content or name issue thats what the request is about there are two reasons why im asking you N you are the main person behind the whole separate section but not the lede idea and N im not sure if vycius speaks english since he is posting to talk pages and his own user page exclusively in lithuanian 
 feel free to move the proposal or discussion straight to the 
 oh no im staying out of mos wars 
 i urge you again please follow the standard dr process and try to engage them in dialogue first its the courteous thing to do apart from being enshrined in wikipedia policy if that doesnt work out send a message to the usual admins who have overseen these conflicts like sandstein t canens future perfect id be willing to talk to v if your dialogue fails and if theres a good chance that these people will be keeping an eye on the discussions and edits 
 as for now i did not see any courage neither courtesy on these matters im enraged but sadly not surprised just to make you sure i did not use any sockpuppets nor ever intend to do so no gentleman would do so 
 im happy to hear that assurance i wouldnt have thought it of you but then i only know you from the internet as for the virtues you mention they arent wikipedias highestranked ones vg 
 you might recall posting a brief comment in the arbcom about six months ago i dont know whether the brevity of your participation qualifies you as involved but im inviting you anyway if you can spare a moment to comment in my current request proceedings at arbcom for regarding arbcoms decision in the world war ii case sorry to bother you 
 akaicr my involvement was limited to comments at 
 many thanks for your suggestion but actually my problem is a bit more complicated than proxy can solve i have reached a point where i want nothing whatsoever to do with the articles from which im topic banned not even via proxy however what i am seeking from arbcom is clarification as to the scope of my topic ban so that i can move forward arbcom enforcement decision says im topic banned from editing or discussing articles about 
 no need to apologise and thanks for your friendly words unfortunately patience is not among my strong points if any but i will try 
 salve jrm i posted a reply to your query about the boston transcript at 
 well i tried but this club really seems to be not notable their homepage is a quaint collection of local affairs and news of interest only to members while i dont care about notability i know others do but i found myself unable to establish it ps never mind the sollogs thanks for that pun 
 thanks for looking and sorry if i wasted your time it occurred to me later that vliet was an english name or at least 
 i was also surpised then to be jumped on by you is your point that in the interests of cuddlybunnyhood we should ignore whatever this user does peace is all very well and certainly something to be aimed at and mdash but that doesnt excuse reprimanding someone whose words have been twisted and who is trying to set the record straight 
 fair enough perhaps it was a combination of my slight overedginess and your slight oversensitivity feel free to post links to relevant bits of the discussion being all too familiar from other even longerstanding editors as well as to one member of an audience at a talk i gave the other day 
 i do not wilfully ignore what people say i just choose not to respond as these constant arguments are tiresome i pound away because others ignore witness how your own comments have been flagrantly ignored as yet again people seem to want to have a go at me 
 i feel i have done all i can do and said all i can say what people do with my advice is up to them apparently its little if you are really interested in contributing to wikipedia i honestly suggest just getting a new account and forgetting all this ever happened as far as im concerned the point of diminishing returns has been reached a long time ago 
 you will notice that people have now started using the talk page to trash my contributions elsewhere my criticisms of various editors get proven time and time again i am certain that if i spent time contributing elsewhere my id or ip would be traced somehow and the little gang would attempt to hound me from whever i had contributed its their mindset 
 you may be interested to know i have already started contributing see my entries for bournemouth 
 since you added the category friday the N th actors to the 
 added mention i was attempted to connect it to her buck rogers following by elaborating on the behindthescenes drooling of the filmmakers where she acknowledges her 
 what do you make of 
 thanks for speedy deleting this and protecting the page 
 seconded if i had had the courage of my convictions i would have done the same rather than just leave a driveby delete comment 
 i know the feeling i guess im less concerned with the wikipolitics of it all than i used to be and my decision to delete was entirely defensible all there is on this guy is rumour really 
 while i have no problem with you renaming the war of the worlds television series article from 
 there is no technical reason to adjust any 
 [http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlebournemouth and actionhistory 
 and also impotence 
 i think it goes deeper than that 
 if you really feel 
 thanks for stopping by my fellow browncoat (always nice to see another 
 whoa whoops looking through the history it seems it was an anon user and not you who added the bit about flames apologies still id appreciate it if you took a look at it and gave your opinion 
 actually wait it was 
 you say there that you are not an admin why not you should be 
 aye theres the rub indeed i would nominate you maliciously hoping to waste even more of your time any day 
 lets do that will fix him seriously it doesnt have to take up more time than you are already spending jrm further you can still get into the muck with troublesome users to the same degree but with a few powers to help out me i use my powers most on new pages patrol and cleaning out catcsd 
 id use them to block you both for disrupting wikipedia to illustrate a point 
 seriously you have got me wrong geogre im not reluctant for jrm to be an admin in fact i just now on dabs page exhorted jrm to accept 
 i saw your request at 
 i say nope you dont episodes are self referencing 
 you seem to think that i am a please explain to me exactly how i have spammed the sollog article with my contribution about the great quake it is one thing to delete and condemn quite another to actually be right you do realise that if i have not spammed the sollog article then the accusation of troll is at least weakened 
 now i have never used the word spammed i was not involved in deleting your contribution neither did i condemn it and as i said above my assessment is not based on your contributions as i understand it it was reverted on grounds of being factually inaccurate not pov but whether or not this is so you should take that up with those who reverted you not me 
 i dont know if you know about it but you should see what im doing with the page in 
 the term mass murderer and serial killer kind of both describe him im probably going to remove both on the grounds that hes fictional to explain hes a serial killer because he doesnt do it all at one time though he certainly mass kills people in each movie also the films actually refer to him as such but mass murderer can include a length of time in one spot which he also does but he has ventured out of crystal lake that is why i think im going to remove it unless i can get a quote from a creator saying something to the effect of one of them hopefully my two books will be here by next week if you look on the page you can see that i started a gallery for his mask clothes seem to be less interpretive of the director than a change in the mask i think each mask design has been about what the director wanted and i wanted to address that and include a gallery of the more major changes to the mask kind of like what the did with 
 i appreciate help and if you are wary about something i say just bring it up on the talk page of the sandbox as for the list of pop culture if you have a list of verified cited pop culture references i can turn it into prose we dont need everything just the most notable ones and then just provide an external link to the whole list i can see him being a spree killer but again i think we have a problem of defining a character by ourselfs when we are not experts in that field it may be wise to leave it out completely and just refer to him as a murderer or something dont look at the page as if its even close to finished i tend to work rather chaotically and just jot down the basic principles i want and then go back and smooth through it the lead will be the very last thing i do the literature section is bare at the moment because im working off just the plots from each book i cant discuss how some expand the continuity and how some are just their own thing because i havent read them they are also on my list of books to buy from amazon but im more interested in getting the outofuniverse content from the two nonfiction books that i bought than explaining the expansion of his history in literature your suggestion about the look of jason is what i was going to go for in the design section im hoping the books have good interviews with the sfx creators so that i can talk about how they went about changing him i think his facial look is most important if you look at part N and N you can see that he looks quite similar just older and that is probably attributed to the fact that tom savini did the makeup for jason on those films also you can see i have one image already in that section of tom putting on makeup and if i can i think i may opt to have a gallery of his facial changes as for the early life of jason if you are talking about how he became deformed well victor miller addressed why he was deformed but other than that im not sure what you are asking the reception section is something im toying with i am wondering if i can find maybe reviews about the character like from his early appearances to something from maybe afi but please come to the talk page with any suggestions or questions you have about something you think is wrong or poorly placed i already have another editor working on the freddy article in another sandbox 
 the books finally came so i can get to crackin on that article with some serious sources man that crystal lake memories book is bigger than my college textbooks 
 no i didnt think you were ignoring me im just as busy as yourself as a matter of fact i have an asl exam this afternoon as for the article there are a lot of things that are borderline when it comes to adding them so far i have gotten through the entire section about the first film in the making friday the N th book lots of good stuff for the film article and for the pamela voorhees article i found a few things about jason but this author didnt go into detail about what went into his design specifically there was a brief bit about using the plaster molding and stuff and some things that ari did himself i did get where jason voorhees received his name i think im going to get more from the sequel sections since they focus more on jason himself that in universe thing you want since its from the books would best be suited in the literature section if you have the book id need you to fill out the cite book template for me making sure you include the page number that it is mentioned and tell me what to say even jabba the hutts literature section goes into a little detail about how he is described in a particular book and thats something that is kind of important i dont have the novelizations yet so if you do then id need your help with that what are your thoughts on this userbox you suggested oh anything else you what to take a stab at you can write it up in the talk page of the sandbox and we can discuss it there this way if we both like it then we can fine tune it there and just insert when ready 
 sounds like an awesome idea for a userbox if you create it or need help let me know id definitely want to get that box right now i say cite part vi if its mentioned earlier we can fix the citation and change the wording after the fact if you arent sure what to use 
 thank you have the ye olde bidet award of N in recognition of your stout efforts in the great april fools hoax war 
 by my own unfortunate policy of accepting and prominently displaying any award bestowed on me i will have to treat this dubious honour likewise 
 i noticed that you have worked on this page before and the edit summary in your recent edit leads me to suspect that you know more than a number of 
 btw is 
 would you consider a charter convention and mdash 
 without having seen anything though color me skeptical the wiki tends not to take constitutions charters legislative bodies politicians and other trappings of formalized power well things spring up as they appear to be needed there is one rule i hold dear to my heart 
 might i also subvert you 
 we have always asked for clarification on that section of the box at the infobox template discussion page no one ever seems to have any i have argued that batman and robin should be included in that list just like superman iv should be included with superman returns casino royale was a reboot but die another day still comes before that film 
 like would the N the day the earth stood still be classified as a followed by for the original the day the earth stood still if thats your question then my immediate reaction would be to assume no i say this because the original film didnt have a series of films follow it the followed by and preceded by is for when there are a series a films on said topic this isnt a series of films but merely someone elses interpretation of the original material they are not restarting anything or continuing some vague continuity of characters like i would put all of the national lampoon movies together because they are part of the national lampoon franchise i wouldnt put the countless versions of pride and prejudice together because they are not part of a series of films but just constant remakes of one novel but thats my first reaction you might have read the response on the film infobox talk page about the followed by and preceded by sections 
 it has been over a month where are you come on you have gotta come back at least visit us occasionally 
 so here i am visiting where are my tea and cookies 
 my the service here is quick ta 
 heyo thanks a bunch for the work you did on 
 i actually only planned to remove those quotes you complained about and the single you then i got carried away but im glad you like it 
 hello thank you for trying to save the logos from the television station pages however simply interspersing them through the rest of the article doesnt really justify their use nonfree media must achieve something than simple words cannot can you find a reliable source discussing the change in branding or something which directly relates to a specific logo 
 most logo changes happen when the networks have a rebranding and they can be found on the canadian communication foundations other than that i dont believe there are a lot of sources out there besides youtube videos 
 you have not added critical commentary you have merely thrown the images in where there is a lot of text the images are at the moment purely decorative im not going to revert again today because of the N rr without sources and genuine critical commentary you cannot use the logos 
 i believe i have added critical commentary if you dont see what i have did as critical commentary then nothing i do will ever please you enough for the logos to stay on as i mentioned before sources for logo changes are usually from the ccf but they are very vague 
 the yellow a logo shows promise but the other two in that rather messy section are problematic i dont see the critical commentary that justifies using these nonfree media critical commentary isnt a currency a history section doesnt buy you an image you need to justify every image 
 i can add some more commentary to these logos but its going to take a lot of time i have a question regarding wordmark logos are they still considered nfc when they only contain words and simple shapes as far as i understand they are in public domain correct me if im wrong 
 hi please consider changing your vote on 
 forget the above i have found conclusive evidence of the use of the term pandeism dating back to 
 you are looking at the text not the meaning the whole thing as written is nonsense but this higgins was both a druid and a phallicobsessed joker everything in this has a double meaning this is a guy who was a follower of tolands would have known about both pantheism and deism using a term that we know has absolutely nothing to do with any religions ranging from medea to india so what does it really mean why would a man in higgins position make up a word like that and use it as he does 
 pandeism is completely rewritten you win have a nice day 
 hi you recently fully protected this page this does not allow the user to do as instructed by the admin whom conditional unblock to the user it also prevents users such as myself guiding this user i would ask you to reconsider the protection thanks 
 hi there the user was blocked indefinitely for making no constructive edits to wikipedia after the block he continued to 
 he was also given a conditional unblock normal i would have not become involved but recently i have assisted 
 if 
 my mistake google once again seems to be out of date its been N years since i have been up that way and almost every time i would cut over to highway N via N avenue i have undid your change from blaine to seattle as this is no where near seattle and thanks for clarifying the metro vancouver item as well 
 dont worry i dont use google maps as a reliable source of maps i rely on a canadian map company called mapart for all my maprelated sources 
 before i get into a N rr situation the city column is not the destination of the route it is the city the interchange happens in which is blaine the destination is listed in the template not the city column blaine can be removed from the jct template however 
 oh @ and ( i didnt see i put that into the city column my mistake i apologize if i caused any troubles i meant to put seattle into the jct template 
 dont worry about it i still need to clean up the article and cite the bc portion of it but i figured instead of trying to expand wa N anymore i could tackle a combined article 
 i want the article moved and the redirect in the main namespace deleted (as do most wikipedians i have clarified my intentions adjust your own comments accordingly 
 thank you 
 sort of yes my point was merely that that person has been voting to oppose anyone and everyone who has said a word about the belle dame sans merci ie its something a bit automatic and really not by anyones reckoning substantive asking for substance in that case is just going to feed the fire an argument takes two sides and i think its enough that the community acts in an appropriate manner in regard to those with monomanias without allowing them to continue to believe that those actions are personal 
 oh hell i was being so circumloquitous that i confused myself on rereading that ok at the risk of offending here it goes i personally think that everyking is an excellent editor with a long history of contributing high quality material but he has an unaccountable monomania about ashlee i dont get it you dont get it no one gets it however it is a subject he cares so passionately about that it has led him to some highly illjudged actions well the community has i think acted appropriately to counter these whimsies you have been one of those who has opposed his misguided efforts for whatever reason everyking is now voting to oppose every rfa of every person who has ever said an unkind word about the ashlee articles thats reactionary and again i think misguided and illconsidered theres nothing substantive in these oppose votes no rationale no reason and i dont think anyone is swayed by them my fear is that for everyking something that should be objective has become personal and the worst thing we can do is allow him to move the ground of the debate onto personal animus i hate the idea of a valuable worker like him losing himself and our losing him to this passion and i keep hoping that if we refuse to play the game of personal invective and defense we can sway him back to the true path there now i have said it and everyking can be mad at me too if he wants 
 on this point since i left this message the us route shields and state route shields are all public domain as us government work the bc traffic signs from what i understand are still copyrighted items and per their copyright notice template were refused to be published as a free item 
 however i cant say my heart is in these little ruses the ridiculousness factor of getting more votes than you does kinda turn the whole thing into a joke or 
 but getting more votes than me is nothing at all eh its ok i know where i stand last years model and all that oh look heres someone to endorse me

 regarding pew research center thats not at all authentic a shia ngo named as alimam mentioned figures of N million years ago so was in N as N million by times network pew report is no where authentic indian provinces were ruled by shiites shiites have penetrated india since a long time if you feel it incorrect come and experience the influence if not then cite neutral sources do you have imam alis birthday as public holiday in even a single city of pakistan not even iraq and lebanon have it but india does however your biased claim will be refuted shortly after the release of N census report of india pakistans shia population does not even match with N census of india then how come with N 
 hello i am having some tough time trying to make you realize that pakistan is considered the second largest shia population and when the indian claim is there it also need to satisfy the international community since there isnt any neutral source proving the indian claim the claim is rather dubious or uncertain pakistan never had a census after N and all the census were not based on sectarian divisions hence what ever you say regarding india stays in india neither am i denying the indian claim but since that claim is selfpublished and has no international neutral sources to prove it it will always be uncertain i have cited at least three sources all neutral to prove my claim that pakistan is the secondlargest shia muslims population guess you dont pay a look at them i also dont regard pew research center as an authentic site but guess it is internationally proclaimed to be authentic and satisfies the wiki criteria see brother what i am saying is that articles should only be about pakistan and india respectively i am not playing with the shia islam in india by inserting the pakistani shia claim of being second largest neither should you play the article shia islam in pakistan by inserting sources about the claim that only you people regard to be authentic secondlargest claim yet stays with pakistan no matter what hence please dont do this and yes i will await for the N census of india till then please stop interesting anything in this regard regards 
 stop removing my mentions that the logo and promo style was changed if you watch ytv you will notice that the logo is quite changed with the ytv letters completely white and the background little bit modified also the promo font and style is changed you dont have to remove stuff 
 logo really changed although the websites logo hasnt changed the logo on tv clearly changed i will soon come up with a screenshot if so 
 redirects may be cheap but be careful how you use them 
 ok but what i meant is that it redirecting to a page that would be totally unrelated to someone who didnt know any better may be confusing also i think it could eventually become a reasonable article thanks 
 please note that i have disputed the neutrality of 
 the article is wholy laudatory in content much of it written in language that wouldnt disgrace hello magazine its difficult to see what could be less npov really its not the use of the title which gets other editors so incensed its the article as a whole 
 i will copy it to the talk page 
 i noticed you uploaded the logo for cbc television that is currently in the cbc tv articles they have recently changed their logo any possibility you could update the file to the new logo i noticed it is an svg file i dont know how to create those so if i upload the new logo it will be in png format let me know thanks 
 as of his latest reversion hes now at $rr reverting the same content as hed done the same to two previous attempts of mine to stay the course see 
 warned him for N rr will report him 
 ok with you if i play white i suck so i should go firstand if you dont agree i will crush you like a mag whoa power rush anyway ok with you 
 ahh im sorry you are right i should have told you just forgotnext time i will be more considerate 
 hi there it might be a good idea for you to check if the sources which you have added to 
 thanks for the comments i see you have put 
 your recent moves of articles such as 
 take main street and science world station for example because they have internal spaces the dash between them is spaced many websites and organizations do not follow standard dash rules that does not mean we shouldnt feel free to ask more 
 i see you are linking the names of the locos to the racehorses they are named after flying scotsman is currently linked to that loco article 
 i have changed it so that the N and N link to 
 i was taking it from the ontv website from what i have seen i have only seen them use the black background version and from watching the station awhile back the black background version seems to be mroe familiar to me and i cant remeber seeing the svg file version you uploaded but if the svg file is more accurate then im fine with it 
 since its not plain text though id still consider it to cross the threshold of originality this may be worth a discussion at 
 please do not upload copyrighted images and license them as ccatt N images from http or or wwwseatafcom or 
 my mistake the cc lic image is really tiny i had to look though the page for some time apologies 
 all images restored 
 yes im noticing a pattern where you are responsible for some cataclysm and yet manage to completely avoid responsibility for anything i will be watching you much more closely in the future and one day hope to accumulate enough circumstantial evidence to convince the arbcom 
 giving people puppy dog looks is a big part of it for sure 
 sure go right ahead and thanks for offering 
 i checked my current computer and unfortunately couldnt find the files you were looking for i really should have downloaded them im going home for christmas hopefully i will find the files backed up on cds somewhere keeping my fingers crossed and will keep you posted 
 just noticed a spelling error on your svg map of the evergreen line burquitlam station is incorrectly spelled as burtquitlam also if you get a chance i might suggest separation between the evergreen and wce lines so that its clear they are not sharing track and having evergreen cross over wce just west of ioco station id take a crack at making the changes myself but i dont have a commons account set up and you are probably more familiar with the file than i am cheers 
 i got most of that done after an ip commented on my commons userpage i will separate the wce tracks from the evergreen lines soon 
 nice editing i think this page is a definite keeper now 
 i will see what other sources i can find though im quite busy with life in general so it will be a bit bitty from me 
 thanks for your new additions which led me to discover 
 emarsee where is the consensus of which you speak please show me where to find a discussion as to where this consensus was reached as i have explained to you before displaying the url provides additional information in the same amount of space piping the channel name over it is hiding that i dont understand why you think it is beneficial to hide useful information in this way 
 finally i know what wtf means please dont use it in edit summaries its incivil and unproductive 
 theres a clear difference between ignoring behavioural guidelines such as N rr and npa and ignoring style guidelines when it will improve an article after all there is an encyclopaedia here which is supposed to be being written if you cant be bothered to at least try to understand why i was actually trying to make improvements to the articles then i dont see why you feel that you can going around reverting good faith edits 
 also if you look at the 
 further on this topic i have started this a discussion at 
 anyway i agree that the http or or protocol should be omitted although the www should be included as they are not part of the url 
 in cases such as the ctv northern ontario example you mention putting the complete url is clearly ridiculous an alternative would be to link to however where there is an easilyremembered url such as it is better to display it as a general principle i think that showing the url is more helpful 
 please see the talk page 
 this edit you made last night N april N N m central artery and bull you refered to the image as being incorrectly placed at the central artery page but in fact the state still calls the tunnels the new central artery please see the links i provided at 
 lets leave it unchanged a disambiguation may actually create confusion i am only speculating on the wording here but this page is about the freeway in boston for information about the tunnel see thomas p oneill jr tunnel assumes someone searching for the tunnel ends up at central artery which is unlikely you may want to link the word tunnel 
 hi jrm one of your subpages has been tagged for deletion i was wondering if it was okay with you to delete it 
 judging by the redlink im too late now arent i seriously though while we could have a long debate on how to interpret the csd policies in this particularly intricate case i doubt wikipedia is worse off from just having it deleted with some bemusement i notice that the thing was 
 lol yes i agree i thought i would ask since it was a user subpage it was possible you wanted to keep and move or rename it considering the nature of the page it was unlikely but still it was your call oh well back to the janitor closet 
 dont be too proud of this editorial terror you have constructed the ability to destroy a vandal is insignificant next to the power of the wiki 
 that was a great one thanks for the laugh 
 you obviously have no clue how this site works it is up to the person making the positive statement to prove it your link was to an expired license by your logic the page on america should say george w bush is president it is up to you to prove your words or they cant be on wikipedia see 
 and yes it would kill me to search why do you want me to die 
 hey jrm i stole your wikipediababel table for 
 for your honesty in admiting that i wasnt the first to steal the table i say you get to keep the indulgence however if you really areally feel you cant accept an indulgence then i award you a 
 thanks for that catch somehow i had mistaken that the globe and mail was a canwest publication by the way i appreciate all your help on the article its been quite the task to get this article ready when vancouver lost its fa some of us were shocked but looking over it more in depth it seems like how could it not have 
 fusion power reactions you idiot not reactors what were you thinking this personal attack was selfdirected i assume 
 can you conceive of two different people having two different definitions for what an atheist is can you concieve of someone that fits one of those definitions but not the other i assure you such exists and that person is therefore an atheist from one point of view and not an atheist from the other point of view N N N jun N 
 replace atheist with any other noun and the argument applies likewise the argument you are making is a staple of metaphysics but i do not see the added relevance applied to atheism specifically we can similarly claim that one persons christian is another persons heretic that one persons brilliant movie is another persons turgid mess its all very true but its not specific enough to be of added value jrm xbN talk N N jun N 
 this article makes a very big deal out of counting percentages of atheists in the heading and a section about this and that and the other poll those references to counting atheists makes it relavent here but not in articles that define a term but dont go out of their way to assert so many percent are in the group remove those references and the contradictory use and nonexclusive use is no longer directly relevant so remove those and then i would agree with you leave them and pointing out the difficulty in counting atheists remains relevant the child of two jews is adopted by a catholic and given infant baptism the person has no specific religious beliefs that person is counted as what at age two at age N inbetween the point is relevant the way i made it could undoubtably be improved but the point is better made as is than not made at all N N N jun N 
 i just added a few more responses on the atheism talk page im turning off my computer now i will be back tomorrow thanks for entering into this conversation for the longest time no one would talk sense to me about this section so it never occured to me to make it fit this article more specifically you are helping thanks 
 glad to hear it 
 thanks for the little insertion now we will have to see if people actually listen and edit the proposal or sit on their butts for eternity whining about how trolls will take over the world and ndash 
 ouch you dont want me to guess which is more likely do you > 
 please come by philwiki to help build the structure so we can open it to the public by april 
 id love to come by and help im afraid though that i wont be able to commit as much time and effort into it as i once thought i will try to help as much as i can please accept my apologies 
 after you unprotected it there have been N revertcounter reverts so far between and please protect the article again and look into 
 thank you for warning me about N rr i was acting in goodwill as proposed by 
 i will not protect the article if one person persistently reverts against consensus but neither am i going to block solely that person for engaging in a revert war revert wars are harmful nobody has any business engaging in them even if it is to revert someone who seems to be stubborn and unwilling to cooperate revert wars and page protection harm anyone who wants to edit the article including anonymous editors and they should be limited as much as possible we have procedures of 
 from your friend in 
 hello merry christmas to you too i hope santa has been good to you this year 
 is this really serious i hope not im a real newbie have been looking around and this my first encounter with something potentially nasty i have made a comment somewhere on his stuff you could probably find it it is a bit elliptical referring to some of his contributions which is how i came across him im not surprised about his concerns but i have seen nothing elsewhere to back them up thanks for help and for all your lightness 
 hey jrm jeffrey asked me about this one as well and i filled him in i thought id let you know so you didnt go to the trouble of duplicating 
 does that also constrain the extension to one month or not as the text stands this is unclear thanks 
 i have seen careless admins block dynamic ips indefinitely so i wouldnt take admin behaviour in the field as a reliable guideline but if you areally want to get to the bottom of this i suggest asking on 
 i regret to inform you that i had to undo two of your blocks on ips used by marmot because they were cache proxies and used by many other people see also 
 lucky 
 summing up thanks for your thoughtful comments they have been very helpful i think we are done don t worry im not going to take it badly no matter what and dont be a chicken about lightsaber 
 oh you said i guess we have slightly different approaches to how one might handle an afd that one is unsure of theres an essay in there no doubt so maybe the question to ask here is how do you handle an afd you are unsure of mine is to seek additional input and to review the article the comments the contribution histories of the commentors and weigh things im not fond of relists as it seems to just postpone the issue a bit but sometimes they are the way to go 
 huh yeah there probably is an essay in there somewhere but im not going to write it id go with your mix pretty much but throw in a dose of precedent just for stability and examine the arguments to see if any are on my list of bad ways to argue an afd and usually deal with those by name explicitly in my closing comments however if i am genuinely unsure what to do with an afd and dont want to take the copout route of no consensus because im not sure thats right either then i simple dont close it i just leave someone else to take the heat perhaps their thinking will be clearer than mine but i dont generally seek multiple opinions on how to close an afd if i cant do it myself i just stand aside i agree with what you say on relists and i think they should only be used where the debate is too short to be able to call it any kind of decision at all if theres more than minimal participation but no agreement then the closer should say so and be done with none of this relisting for a clearer consensus nonsense if i find there to be no consensus i say so 
 if there was a u series would be very interested in it 
 see 
 thanks ian this page appears to describe u as a generic classification rather than something specific to the sulzer traction engines u was not as best as i can find used to describe any of the sulzer variants 
 are you just using the heuristic same user radically different ip or something more tangible 
 i cant say how cesarb did it but its running an open web proxy on port N 
 i know now how cesarb did it but i can only pass the trick along to members of the cabal that is everyone whos not a vandal 
 the skulking while on wikibreak garbage disposer is awarded to jrm as a foretaste of the appreciation of the community when you return full time be sure to see us first for all your laundry beverage chilling and outside grilling needs 
 ps please use for obvious csds only 
 this is perfectly normal folks you are not supposed to understand whats going on here 
 that sucks i like this alot people are always getting after me for my signatures i tell you what come up w an appropriate title for me and i will change it to that as far as the readability my thought was that people could simply click on it if they have some sort of hoveraversion so that you know the next signature i was planning on was or some variation thereof oh and yes you are the first to mention it 
 are you there i just posted yap yet another plea on 
 fine yapping thanks very much 
 supposed to inform you about the delist nomination since you originally nominated it 
 thanks i think people stalk my page too its part of life in the fast lane some people have told me that how they know whats going on in here others say they stalk because im interesting for future reference you can find barnstars at 
 you are just that popular 
 hmmm 
 because im an idiot thats why i will put em back thanks for the catch 
 it is a cool username but i think mr mouse should be warned that anon e mouse was a psuedonym previously adopted on 
 hi jrm while i myself dislike the meaningless rant left by a user at 
 i hope this clears things up for you if you disagree with my assessment feel free to reinstate the comment yourself i will not override this decision 
 the only problem with bringing it back to wikipedia is that a similar list was vfdd from wikipedia and its undeletion request also failed so theres no way they are going to be on wikipedia since the main page of commons says it will accept texts and text must be in some specific language i dont see why this list cant be on commons regardless of the language the names will remain spelled the same so people can always extract that information if wanted commons is the only place left for these lists so please support them remaining there until such time that they are undeleted from wikipedia and nbsp 
 commons says it possibly accepts texts which i read as there may be some need though we cant really see how that would work it doesnt seem to fit the intent of commons at all i could imagine something like a transcripted dna strand to end up on commons rather than source seeing that thats languageindependent and of potential interest to articles in all languages but a list of victims of a maritime disaster i have a hard time separating that from its article the framing text of the list is english the references are all english how is this going to be useful separately the lets just keep it here for now argument isnt compelling to me the main article can exist properly without a live link to something that may need to be moved or transwikid yet again id rather have this issue sorted out properly than a halfhearted lets stick it there and forget about it if this sort of thing areally doesnt belong on any wikimedia project we should have that spelled out 
 i just put your name under mine since you deserve more credit than me and i am going to get a dyk credit in terms of the article we have to follow 
 all i can find right now is 
 below is a copy of my note to inter regarding yet another block on my aol or ip number although the note below indicated you had researched and placed the number on the list inter is not aware of it appreciate any followup possible thank you 
 responded on your trophy page this is a continuing problem that could be fixed but nobodys done it yet 
 thanks for your response and your interest in resolving the problem it will be difficult to change the practices of front line admins as the vandal wars will always be with us hopefully someone will make your software suggestion a priority in the future it sounds like it would work well peace 
 it was a tough decision > but i have closed 
 oh my thats a lot of new buttons i wonder if i can delete the main page 
 you make me proud congratulations 
 congratulations 
 thank you see moonriddengirl you were one of the first to congratulate me despite the time difference 
 and it ends in a unanimous decision you are an administrator use the tools well my friend i am confident that you will be an outstanding administrator 
 thanks man 
 the reason given for aesculapiusN s block is repeated vandalism of michael parodi ip address is N has wiki thought about a admin sandbox to train people on how to block including using the list of common ips can we get this resolved in any fashion thank you 
 in this case 
 complicated issue i just tried to edit and was accepted thank you if you took some action to release me appreciate your help 
 oh yes i did unblock the addresses sorry for not revealing that little unimportant tidbit of information 
 zoes block just hit me again if you are still online how about another release appreciate the favor 
 another block do the admins want me to work here 
 im as frustrated by this as you are but the administrators simply cant help it we can petition the developers for changes in the software but this is by no means a fast process you are of course unblocked 
 thank you appreciate your emotional support and attention even if we cant do anything else 
 back again are you by chance still hanging around blocked again new record two different blocks in one day thanks 
 make that three i dont think im going to get to 
 hi me again can you please release the block thank you 
 thanks since you are the grand assigner of titles perhaps you could come up with one for me some kind of reward for this persistance in the face of falling blocks should be in order bless you 
 ohmy very first barnstar thank you so very much 
 anyway i would have sent this in a pvt message if i could find the button but i cant with your interest in nahuatl i thought you might be interested in a resource a friend of mine has been developing to help speakers of smaller languages find each other on the sea of english that is twitter so far there are N twitterers that seem to at least occasionally use it 
 thanks that is an interesting tool i dont tweet myself i have enough to do around here 
 i will be one of those ignorant types when i became an admin i noticed a severe lack of instruction in most corners of wikipedia so i thank you for that notice on an im not very technically adept so i the ip stuff kind of baffles me a few days ago i blocked 
 whew this is not an exhaustive guide but it covers a lot of ground in general dont worry too much about it and mdashblocking isp proxies is bad but when you have established its not an isp proxy its usually safe 
 thanks that explains a lot actually i have stored it in a personal subpage so i can refer back to it for eternity and treasure and cherish it one more question that will probably sound stupid its my understanding that when username is blocked their most recent ip is also blocked if this is true why doesnt the same caution hold with all blocks not just ips since all will block an ip if lets say i block a user indefinitely isnt their ip autoblocked indefinitely as well bringing up all these same problems i have a feeling my whole premise is wrong anyway thanks for your valuable help 
 thanks for the trashcan so much more inspiring than that flower 
 yes i thought it was more original and i thought it was more appropriate to the subject to blocks and vandals than a flower anyhow that really clears up a lot i didnt realize the autoblocker was only N hours i had assumed it it took on the same sentence as the original block by the way having not had much communication with you before now i should probably tell you that whenenver i see your name i pronounce it in my mind as germ thats how you meant it right erm anyway thanks again 
 sigh it seems everyone eventually settles on the germ pronunciation i dont care i like those initials im not going to sign everything with 
 you get the same treatment as ed for that 
 you mean i will get praised reviled awarded barnstars rfced taken to arbitration threatened with blocks and blocked for one minute ouch d 
 i dont know enough to confidently fix it 
 never mind rasputinaxp fixed it 
 now about 
 thanks that was a good link the gfdl page is a bit confusing though 
 id go into more detail but its really late over here and i have to go to bed please feel free to ask around on the 
 thanks for adding the cornwall image 
 i found the image on commons with an incorrect description and in the uN cunidentified locomotivesuN d category so ituN s more to luck than anything that the image and the article were linked i havenuN t a clue how the image ended up in a german archive 
 actually what drew me to that article was something my grandfather said a long time ago he said to me always remember that if your faith cant take criticism if you find yourself growing angry then the problem isnt the person talking to you its you you need to examine why you believe i have met a lot of people online since then who think the ipu is heretical particularly when the holy horn is used to make an imitation of the christian cross and i remember what my grandfather said and just shake my head it doesnt offend me it challenges me and makes me think about why i believe well as such i thought the article could use a bit of work expanding on the known bits of the ipu dogma 
 expansion is fine but its unlikely enough of this day of oats and hay is inven known to warrant an article separate from the main article on the unicorn if im wrong by all means write the article and link it but consider expanding the main article instead and splitting off a new article only when it becomes necessary otherwise it looks like one of those redlinks that will always remain red or expand into an eternal single sentence or just draws anons who will type random nonsense and leave my evaluation is of a purely technical nature and not meant to be a value judgement 
 no no you dont understand the above wasnt argument or complaint it was humor and conversation you are right the day of oats and hay doesnt deserve its own page 
 sorry taking professional attitude too far so hows the weather over on your end d (no no dont answer that before you know it my talk page will look like 
 so you are saying that those discussions were a waste of time and they should continue anyway that doesnt make sense 
 continued on your talk page 
 thanks for the reversion i guess is this cheese supposed to be the cheeselover oddness and exactly what im not getting involved with these days lest i loose my wrath you know that was a spam message as if i were going to get upset at an accusation that someone has religious faith 
 cheesedreams had a fallout with eequor a very hostile and unproductive fallout in fact you might say cheesedreams went completely nuts 
 all my deepest sympathy lefty you are now an administrator what horrid thing did you do to deserve this fate im glad to see that everyone saw the obvious you will be excellent but feel free to ask me if you have any questions uN 
 heh thanks do you know of any scripts that might come in handy 
 do you use twinkle they have special secret adminonly stuff that i use like their pulldown block notices 
 yeah i have twinkle but theres nothing about blocks in the dropdown menu at the top of the page 
 i guess you have to enable the admin stuff ala 
 fwiw 
 ah nevermind i found it do you know how to automatically notify a user when you speedily delete a page though 
 like moonriddengirl i cant remember half the stuff that i added to my monobook subpage what i did back then was choose an administrator that seemed to have a good handle on scripts then copied their monobook scripts onto mine then it just was a matter of playing around with the new tabs to find their capability when deleting an already speedy tagged page the user should have already been notified by the tagger i only include another message if there has been some significant talk page discussion if you are talking about speedy deleting a page that has not yet been tagged there is a csd button among your top buttons which includes a box to click for automatically notifying the user uN 
 the problem is that i cant click that box see i have no idea whats causing it and i have tried several other articles or 
 i have only ever been able to click it if i first click tag page only dont delete so i do and then i delete it 
 ah i see guess i will have to live with making a few extra clicks then 
 yes i have always had to tag first then delete a twostep process i dont know if there is a script to do it in one shot uN 
 congrats 
 hi when i converted the licensing of 
 listed the image at 
 hi there per 
 seeing as you continue to edit your user page i take it you are ignoring me in that case i shall remove it for you regards 
 again per 
 thats great many thanks for your cooperation 
 hey im still waiting for a response on the bc highway N article 
 vanoc wasnt responsible for eagleridge bluffs and the construction of the sea to sky through there it was the bc mot and the bc liberals again not vanoc also you need to learn how to properly cite sources something that you have failed to do 
 if you happen to be on id appreciate another release best wishes 
 the entire gamut of addresses the unfortunately named wikinazi polluted has been unblocked 
 jrm and bishonen thank you valiant warriors good luck against the threat of the hun 
 this page was modified to 
 in other news why does transclusion favor main namespace over template namespace 
 oh hmm actually means transclude from the main namespace 
 too late i have been playing with and let the flamewars commence ~ 
 thanks the whole dialogue surrounding 
 i just read all of that and im inclined to agree 
 what are u doing u wicked fool 
 my job do you have any specific points to address 
 who the hell are u mr im such an important person who knows everything about wikipedia 
 well i wouldnt say im important but i do know a lot about wikipedia yes im an 
 does anyone else think its funny to see 
 just in case you care to come out of the hermitage to say something on this which seems well within the range of your editing interests 
 how appropriate that yahoo post was made on my birthday too 
 if you have uploaded other unlicensed media please check whether they are used in any articles or not you can find a list of file pages you have edited by clicking on the 
 again answer me with your logic and we can have this issue resolved 
 read wpnotdir and the answer lies in there 
 i put this already on that talk page but am putting it here as you were the one who left comments there if there was no consensus this article needs to be moved back to 
 if you have a particular problem with the way the editor who moved it originally acted you should take it up on an 
 seeing you on my watchlist brings warm feelings to my heart 
 thanks im happy to be back too 
 hey emarsee i wanted to get your thoughts on uploading a new version of the yoopa logo the logo is found it seems to be the correct logo to use i see that one more often than not especially when referring to the tv channel it seems like the one in the english article is for the yoopa brand in general or the logo for the magazine while the second one is for the tv channel i thought id get your opinion since you uploaded the original logo and since you are able to upload svg files you could upload it since i cant the link to the new logo has a svg file so im assuming it would be easy enough to just take that one and upload it 
 if thats the correct logo then it would only make sense to change the file to the correct version 
 i see you keep adding the pictures of kN and the national park to the first section i am currently working on this article and repeadily readding the pictures to the inappororiate sections will cause me to take action i will be writing a section of the mountain region of gilgitbaltistan where i will use your pictures please have patience i plan to do all the regions of pakistan however it will take some time can i place your pictures in the gallery section for future use thankyou 
 hello fast track i too have seen some random ip repeatedly removing the images for no reason hence i was inserting it again and again you should have notified me or else had mentioned it in the editing summary about your clear objective i agree with you that the picture were placed in an inappropriate section but a new section regarding gilgitbaltistan will solve the issue you are most welcome to now use the image on the article but these images should be there on the page since no one really bothers to pay a look at the gallery i hope in near future we both can cooperate together in regard to pakistans tourism article regards 
 do you know i was actually quickly searching around trying to find out what happened sheesh people seem to be leaving like crazy here but that one came areally out of the blue dont ever leave again or i will call you a germ whats that smell 
 well sorry but it all just was too much to handle i honestly didnt know if i was coming back or not lucky for you i reconsidered 
 its fine if you want to edit the atn article but what you wrote pretty much looked like pr speak it seems that you just copy and pasted information from atns website and or or press releases this is not acceptable on wikipedia as the content from the atn website is copyrighted feel free to add the information back but be sure to remain 
 the 
 so basically now i know its a weekly update thanks 
 can you please turn temp protection on thanks 
 semi protected for N week its just an ip editor being a pain and hes on telstra so an ip block wouldnt fix it 
 hey geschichte thanks for you help with the article just one thing i see you used 
 gee havent seen that its still a good rule though 
 meh i quite like a liberal sprinkling of foreign terms in articles about foreign articles myself and dahls translators kept storting throughout but im not about to get worked up about it only a minor preference 
 also have you considered reviewing the article for me 
 ok i think i am having a serious think about defunct disused and closed in relation to railway lines and railway stations for the whole of wp any thoughts on that one if there is one standard the actual article is defunct do you think that is the best some idea of my way of thinking is at http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or user_talkgood_olfactory#another_pedant_from_west_of_your_location 
 i prefer defunct as it has the broadest scope it can cover stations closed to passengers where the line is still open for freight or goods and lines that have been embargoed because the company wants to abandon it but doesnt want to go through the formal close process (see 
 thank you very much for that if you and go both say that then i shall start a process of changing applying at cfd the cats that i have created and others that dont conform within the next week or so i think the disused bothers me so much i might even start before then 
 thank you for your help in cleaning the cats up as well cheers 
 one of my big gripes across a whole lot of projects is the constant doubling up of mother and child cats at south australian locomotives the cat locos by railway and locos of oz surely that is a case where the mother and child are being doubled up 
 the child categories of 
 you may be interested in my rather poorly expressed ideas athttp or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or wikipediacategories_for_discussion or log or N _january_N #categorywestern_australian_locomotives i am getting embarrassed at the way i expressed myself there this does just touch what you have mentioned 
 see http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or category_talklocomotives_by_railway for the standard practice 
 similarly at http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or transaustralian_railway to me listing both the state and lines cats is another motherchild double up what do you think 
 well as the article is in 
 i agree totally thank you so much for letting me sound this out having had the conversation i will feel much more on safe ground pulling out many mothers from some very odd overcategorised items 
 apologies for spring all this on to you the server lag is so bad i am getting off will check here again tommorow cheers 
 are you unable to pee with a half filled bladder 
 sigh you are quite right you want to explain this fine distinction to the creators of the hoax drinking lots of water will fill up your bladder faster than usual assuming a person pees only when their bladder is telling them to it is reasonable if slightly inaccurate to claim drinking lots of water was the cause of their discomfort feel free to ask anyone you know if they think drinking lots of water will make you pee is a false or misleading statement and more importantly think about whether the creators of the hoax would have thought thisps if their is an award somewhere for weirdest talk page discussion this one should at least get an honorable mention 
 ask and ye shall receive 
 i was always under the impression the creators of excessive drinking can kill you knew the medical facts and were not talking about a bladder you on the other hand seem to have just discovered this medical fact and reasoned the creators did not know either hense they had to be referring to something like peeing so you thought it useful to add what to you was an unkown perspective that hey this really does kill we know we have known for decades this is not news all the items are factually literally true not just almost true 
 of course the only thing that can really settle this pissant debate is if we ask the creators what they meant but its unlikely we will get a response any time soon we can hold a poll to see what other people think if you really want 
 cheers 
 you can upload files on commons 
 i have one more question when did you take this photo cause i need this info for describition 
 hi i have modified the advice you gave for most users working on pages that may eventually be acceptable articles it would be good advice but this particular users output to date has been only hoax articles purporting to show that he is an earl a marquess a prince and he already has two more hoax articles under preparation in his user space which i have 
 thanks for doing that i guess i was a little peeved last night because by the time i got to him he was the second notification i was doing so i was trying to be as supportive as possible i just find it irresponisble that no one will notify users of these deletions i think that he is trying to possibly create an article aout himself there 
 im sure hes writing about himself hes got delusions of grandeur but what drew him to your attention last night he was blocked for a week on N june and his sockpuppet indefblocked has he started another sock 
 no it wasnt that i just took pity on him not being notified of anything this once happened to me on a deletion of a page that i created and i had absolutely no clue on the decision until after the fact i think it is really unfair when the editor has no input on a major decision like that i didnt know that he was that bad of a person though 
 good rivalry indeed i might be able to keep up with you if i stopped dividing attention with hall of famers i will try to address the issues you raised tomorrow appreciate the review 
 and all points should be addressed thanks 
 is an example before the fact in the footnote is revealed to the hoaxers forcing the word generally to be added unpleasant due to pissing or bladder generally due to th footnoted item i guess we were mostly focused on different parts of the sentence 
 yes we are getting somewhere your theory sounds plausible originally the hoaxers really did think excessive drinking caused no worse than a trip to the bathroom then someone pointed out thats not true and generally was added the reason they didnt go all out and state drinking extreme amounts of water can kill you is probably because people who are ignorant of water intoxication would have considered this false after the hoax was revealed which would have reduced its effectiveness 
 we need something to properly finish this bizarre exchange i nominate i encourage women to retain urine in the bladder for a quick orgasm here is why the urine in the bladder will produce a hydrostatic pressure against the epicenter and cervix where the pressure relays a signal to your brain for production of the orgasm hormone oxytocin that can initiate the orgasm contraction in the uterus that is why male and female wet dream occurs in the early morning when the bladder is full and the testosterone level is at it absolute maximum of the day under this situation a small disturbance in the sympathetic nerves in the urethral bladder prostate and epicenter or cervix or uterus can ignite the orgasm contraction from as a comment about the assertion a full bladder is unpleasant ha this was soooo weird cheers 
 how can i find the coordinates of places alos tell me how to put them in articles 
 hello nabil take a look at 
 jrm the anon vandal adding biased commentary to 
 he is doubtlessly pushing an agenda and hes doubtlessly calling people names neither of which warrants vandalism reverting as you well know lets see if we can straighten this out a little more permanently than by blocking folks 
 this is why i have asked for a review by another administrator i was not involved until he began his personal attacks but i dont feel i should be the one to block him 
 firstly this article would be a featured list not a featured article you should have nominated it there see the nomination procedure at 
 also 
 i have noticed that very many list of tallest articles are featured articles 
 very many there are some such as the 
 which template adds 
 ok found it 
 i asked because i found 
 i made the i proposed and the templates are gone so that part seems to have worked i hope there are no other aversive effects 
 further discussion to the talk page of the article people im not interested in hearing whos been naughty to who 
 i have emailed you 
 literally anyone can decide to start a class action suit against wikipedia and put it up on a webpage putting a link to that on wikipedia is nothing but promotion like i said when you actually sue wikipedia the link will be of interest until then its a cheap way to get wikipedias bandwidthfurther discussion on this belongs on the articles talk page 
 it does not use 
 well i bet you got that from stalking me are you making a template i can use 
 as a matter of fact i was trying to integrate that into my talk page in some pleasing way as we speak i wont need a template though 
 there i dont need edit or purge links on my page and i dont really need a parameter for the mood part either those who want to go crazy with templates are welcome to do so 
 while we are on the topic do you have my sandbox on your watchlist or are you just refreshing my contribution list every five seconds and im the one stalking people uh huh 
 you have access to britannica online i asked you to post the first paragraphs of their article on 
 looks like all of our friends have been identified as socks of the north carolina vandal whose socks number in the millions see 
 ok maybe not millions but there are hundreds several pages worth in that category you are right how sad 
 apparently a kid with nothing better to do im tempted to violate 
 hi i will be glad to take a look if the article goes unreviewed long enough to get into the pr backlog pile we are struggling to keep up with luck you will get a couple of good reviews before the article reaches the backlog 
 yes much better you are using correctly and the citations generally comply with guidelines i see some minor things that id adjust a bit i think its preferable to spell out the publishers names like emporis corporation and skyscraper source media than to use emporiscom or skyscraper page also i would spell out council on tall buildings and urban habitat rather than abbreviating it as ctbuh in the citations sometimes readers forget what the abbreviations mean and have to hunt for the explanations in the main text 
 thanks for your note on my talk page its nice to see a summary of this ongoing problem if you have no objections i will copy it to the top of my aol archive page although i doubt too many people i contact actually look there i will try and provide the admin with more information next time the autoblocker kicks in but i do think telling administrators about the aol or ip problem in some fashion is a good thing so many of the new admins i talk to dont initially understand the problem perhaps your summary could be distributed to the newly elevated thanks again 
 your suggestion of making this part of the reading material required for new admins is a good idea though although even this probably wont do much i will see what i can do 
 id suggest reading the entries in the general copyediting section at 
 im very sorry but my hectic schedule right now makes it impossible for me to help with your article however i wish you good luck 
 has there been an announcement of a big change at wikipedia if so is there a link to the announcement does wikipedia look the way it normally does on your computer i hope you dont mind that i asked you i figured i should ask an administrator and couldnt find any info on this in the village pump 
 its been two days since you posted this so id expect the problem may have resolved itself in the meantime if not try using a different browser (like 
 i have taken the liberty of trying to make clear that 
 because you are a member of the association of inclusionist wikipedians im notifying you that the inclusionist proposa 
 the current state of affairs is flawed but workable although id personally love to see a use only npov v and nor as policy and ignore notability policy and id equally love to convince deletionists that this is what they really want too im pretty sure its not going to happen notability is what is left when all the rational policies have been applied and i think this space between the cracks cant really be eliminated 
 in the case of cryptography i have to disagree with your unprotection id been watching most of the day and was leaning that way myself the degree of vandalism which was happening justified the protection in my view this may an issue which should be taken to the pump for a concensus perspective thoughts 
 er in other words of course this should be taken to the pump if there are different opinions on it consensus is a shifty beast maybe peoples opinions on the matter have changed with time nevertheless i think the big honking warning at 
 hey nabil i have done some copyediting on the list of tallest residential buildings just looking at the flc page im thinking its probably not going to be passed this time around i would suggest that you expand the lead to two paragraphs work on improving the alt text and fix as many of the issues pointed out by reviewers as possible in order to promote the article cheers 
 hi nabil although i do some copyediting and proofing while doing peer reviews i no longer have time for as much copyediting as i once did i was glad to help with a review of the tallest residential buildings list but i cant keep coming back to it the others waiting in line at peer review need help too perhaps one or more of the reviewers at flc can help you work through the remaining problems 
 there is a discussion going on whether the name of that german church body can be translated or not one user changed the name of this church and its regional member churches to the german form because he says their names cant get translated so the article on the evangelical lutheran church in bavaria now appears under its german name because he says the concept cant be translated into english please go to the discusson page of the evangelical church in germany and have your say

 just so you know the zero mission box art is in fact copyrighted as is all video game box art however it would be please dont tag it as public domain 
 actually please tag it i have had to go through a lot of games lately to switch them over 
 you have been helpful in the past how do i get the stub designation removed from an article i have substantially rewritten scone palace and know this subject thanks 
 see 
 what do you want to do with it got a sandbox template made up yet 
 i say go for it but make sure it is on stateautohide so it is already collapsed that will be a bit more aestetic 
 what do i need to do for the rfa 
 can i do that 
 by the way i see now you are new to wikipedia for newcomers its usually a good idea to pay attention to the way things work before trying new things look at the way people edit post and interact with everything here also read the help pages you can also ask questions to people when you are in doubt all of that will help you a lot here and you will understand everything pretty fast and ndash 
 kaonashi the current consensus in wikiproject computer and video games is to use box art not logos i specifically told thunderbrand this and hes doing a good job fixing pages up the castlevania logos can be used elsewhere in the article at any rate thunderbrand i just came to your talk page to tell you that you are doing a good job

 okay thanks for your help 
 i notice you tagged 
 unfortunately the text which that spa added to this article was cut and pasted from what is presumably a copyrighted promotional biography of the subject and therefore cant be used despite all the cleanup work you have done variations on it all predating its appearance on wikipedia can be found here and here and here there are probably others i havent turned up yet i warned the spa about this earlier but it seems sterner action may be necessary thanks 
 yes i did but the method for not linking looks cumbersome and more work other editors had already mentioned that they had also mentioned about excessive links but i felt it better to add something than nothing at all 
 but if im happy with doing the extra work in order that the reader of my text can see dates in his preferred format without links why should i be forbidden to do so in my edits simply because you dont want to do the work in your edits uN 
 you have had your vote i have had mine note doubt we will both comply with community consensus 
 i dont want to control whether you add additional markup or not but apparently you want to control whether i add additional markup or not despite the fact that it wont cost you anything or change how the article you see looks i just dont get why uN 
 there is a new user mynym who added a boatload of questionable material regarding biology to the page its beyond my meager abilities to sort through so if you can check it id surely appreciate it you were the only one of the proscience editors that im familiar with who i can see has edited the page so you are the lucky recipient of this notice thanks

 thanks i am in touch with the authors of ctg as well and gave them the same research i changed the table just now to remove swN rs and increase the total of swN to N i also changed the date of the final production to N uN 
 best regards 
 happy editing 
 per your note above on your talk page your friends in the east are watching to see if you are okay condolences from us in the meantime 
 thanks the last few days have been hard but will be fine in the end i will tell you more offline at some point

 thank you for your confidence new york new york ip who are you uN 
 someone with a N per cent nomination success rate 
 i can conominate you but will people stop calling me xiner thanks that feels better 
 i surely did not i merely mentioned xiner you are obviously a completely anonymous ip with no suggestive edit history none uN 
 thank you and dont you ever forget that 
 i was rolling through the stubs for computer and video games and came across a number of star fox planet articles most of the articles for 
 my thought at the moment is that #N might be the way to go if all the planets are part of the lylat system which i bet they are but im not totally sure of i could go with any of these though i suppose 
 ok given cerinia N would probably be the best also note that there is also a 
 hello nabil raisN the article 
 if you have to improve the articlewhy do not we merge it with geography of pakistan (as 
 yeah we can add combined detail about rivers of pakistan in a new section in 
 i can make the whole article about hydrology in pakistan if i want to but i would only keep redirect of rivers in pakistan but not major rivers in pakistan so let the article of major rivers in pakistan be deleted 
 while im not against changing the color i dont think the color you picked is all that great not to say pink is better maybe a shade of blue 
 i kind of like light yellow myself i could go with sky blue though i really dont care 
 if we do change i figure wed also change 
 it would appear the upgrade boxed it i dont know why i will look into it in a minute and try and fix it up 
 i think i fixed it if you see any more problems let me know 
 if you are going to redirect the missing hlN related links i have been doing could you please do it at the destination with a proper reidrect that way when someone does make the article nobody has to go back and change all the links again cheers 
 i mean instead of changing 
 heh thanks for finding and fixing my copy and paste error at 
 no problem 
 as someone who used to edit 
 intially i had writing credits in the table too and was meaning to take that bit of information out of the individual sections i removed it because i felt there was too much red and i hadnt listed the directors which would have been the only original content except for the plot summaries in the sections it would be somewhat out of place i couldnt add the directors to the table either because it wouldnt fit without making the table look huge adding more red and without removing the image which i feel is almost a necessity for the page its kind of an attention grabber i figure the white space would be even worse if i would have left the toc instead of making a table so i suppose thats the bright side 
 you can tag the articles with which will list them in the 
 hi nabil sortable tables can be a bit of a daunting task but fortunately theres a large help page for it to discuss all the possibilities 
 very sorry but im unable to help at this time with the articles you contacted me about good luck with them 
 or more accuratley thank you thank you thank you sorry if i just scared you off with my eccesive use of the caps lock but i have been loking for a pic of quadraxis for quite a while so thanks alot 
 niiiice well i got to go track down a vandal i just spotted see yah around 
 belated congratulations sorry so late i was out of town and very much intentionally away from any and all computers 
 looks like i missed the entire show extremely belated congrats and if i can be of any help when im around just knock 
 thanks will do 
 oh and welcome back 
 btw i have removed my comments from the tfd and will withdraw the nomination if you can kindly discuss this with me and ensure this is installed i just believe it was a clash of customs you are accustomed to editing this template im not and basically i just wanted to contribute to the aussie articles by adding a decent locator map for towns and remove the old dot maps my intentions are right even if you disgreed with the way i addressed it initially 
 sorry for slow reply it seems to me a reasonable request reason it didnt get fixed before was it was only there for backward compatibility anything we use on a regular basis tends to get fixed lat or long is far more intuitive than x or y in my view im going to be at 
 oh and some of the points you have raised seem reasonable too if you could explain better what you meant about the ordering of display fields i will look into that also 
 as i assume that your assumption was in 
 hm i have heard of such problems before sorry for possibly overreacting uN 
 hey thunderbrand i noticed your great work on videogame related articles and i was wondering if you could help me with something i just started my first videogame article (
 all right thanks 
 hi thunderbrand if this user refuses to add tags and you have asked him multiple times a brief block is in order i think if anyone asks it was my idea 
 noted also on articles for deletion thanks for the heads up forgot i had uploaded that image not linked anywhere so its fine for deletion thanks again 
 yeah you are probably right i have just been trying to figure out a way to get more people involved with the selection process but i agree that it is a bit silly thinking about it some more it probably isnt very wiki either you are an admin so feel free to delete the page 
 im going to think about it some more there has to be a better way to do this 
 thanking for your message regarding ] i am taking the foto and have released it forever into the public domains i have as you sugested kindly visited the page that discusses these things but alas i have no idea what ob means it has on the page for which it was intended been replaced by a better and nicer image so if that one is no use then pleasing feel free to delete pity though because its the only one from that angle 
 fine then leave it where it is because it shows perfectly a unique oriel window which wll be of use when elizabethan architecture finally comes of age thanks 
 i dont know why you listed 
 ah ok 
 so i suggest just to leave each other in peace rather than to start arbitration which would be a significant distraction for us and fellow wikipedians if you want to answer please do not modify or break to parts this message thank you 
 just to make myself clear i am not talking about these two articles but about any articles that you or me might create or work with in the future if we simply avoid each other in the future the problem would be resolved in the easiest way which i think is the best for both of us 
 i asked durova for advice and she suggested that arbcom was probably a good idea i frankly think there are other steps in 
 so you declined my good will offer judging from your reply and this edit well i simply felt that it was fair to talk with you and discuss our possible options of course the disagreement about two articles is not a reason to start arbcom proceedings the only reason can be a longstanding problem that persits for years and has been a subject of previous conflict resolution attempts this is a community issue that should be decided by wp community contrary to what you might think i am not your enemy i believe that you made many valuable contributions to wp and it is unfortunate that you follow my edits and delete well referenced texts in violation of 
 i did not decline any good will offer what i did was suggest that you follow dispute resolution if you have a dispute with me threatening arbcom and bringing up unrelated disputes from years ago is really not considered a good will offer i do not think you are my enemy i think you are misguided as regards wikipedias policies on 
 hi after a brief discussion on the 
 i see the rumours about the speed of the admins were not unfounded thanks hopefully our little encyclopedia will bear the storm a bit easier now 
 if that user has been vandalizing pages i guess the best thing to do would be to list him under 
 so did i ah well no big deal 
 debtor for your deletion alerts i really upload many images and instead of only substituting 
 i finally reported all images without use i have uploaded since i arrived here in wikipedia 
 jtalledo the proper course of action would first be to chill out you seem to be on a witchhunt here okay i will admit i have added some pics of my favorite celebs shirtless but i dont think it counts as vandalism if any of the pics were inappropriate then i apologize however just because a pic doesnt add much to an article doesnt connote ill intention and certainly not vandalism i think you should just calm down and get a hold of yourself i have done work on other articles that do not include just adding shirtless pics and i havent removed other pics from the same articles as you have alleged in other places on the site you might in the future contact someone through their talk page if you wish to discuss something with them instead of putting libelous talk about them around the site im sure some might consider you an asset to wikipedia but you may wish to come down off your high horse and brush up on your etiquette before going any further 
 furthermore according to wikipedia etiquette you are supposed to notify someone on their talk page if you put up an image of theirs for deletion which you did not do by the way you sure seem to spend a lot of your time criticizing and editing what others do i guess its easier to find fault with others than with ourselves 
 thanks for your reply first of all i apologize for neglecting to notify you about my edits as you can see i notified you about one of the images i changed the tags on im not a big fan of having many images on articles and i was unaware of your intentions with these images you could just as easily have found other pictures but you chose to use those for whatever reason but i do extremely resent your claim that im on a high horse say what you want about what i do but personal attacks are very counterproductive especially considering i never made any personal attacks against you i merely was wondering what the proper thing to do was and now you have provided me with that answer i do hope we can settle any future conflicts in a more civil manner and i promise to keep in better contact with you and other users about these issues thank you very much and happy editing 
 i agree with you the user is adding numerous questionable images especially for articles that arent long enough to warrant two in the first place 
 thats all i got off the top of my head i hope it helps or at least fuels some ideas for yourself to improve the article 
 hi 
 the rationale is a seminew thing that a number of editors are essentially forcing other editors to do for fa candidates otherwise they will oppose flat out imho its bs for most images but it has been a guideline for sometime see 
 as it seems you have a lot of familiarity with the wnba id like to make a suggestion i was wondering if a template of all of the current arenas used by the teams in the wnba could be created and put on their appropriate pages much in the style of the nba nhl nfl mls and mlb 
 im not exactly sure about the arenas part but if you are talking about something like 
 okay it should be done for now i added all the 
 people who write articles have a right to vote just as the nominator does even if you take out the anon its only N if you want to put it up for another vote go ahead but i stand behind my decisions 
 okay charlie but counting me and not counting the anonymous user it was N but hey its your call 
 why did you tag 
 the article is hard to read it needs to be broken up into sections i will make some edits 
 hi thunderbrand i have protected your userpage to deal with an insistent vandal hopefully he gets the hint and leaves but we will see what happens 
 you are welcome i guess you did annoy someone but i wouldnt worry about it too much i have unprotected your page since its been protected for awhile and theoretically the vandal has gotten over his anger have a good one 
 you marked it as no source and it was deleted as the person who uploaded the pic it would have been nice had someone notified me i reuploaded it with the proper tag 
 not sure if that was a sincere apology or not if it was thanks if not thanks for at least responding 
 cool thanks 
 also i know its been suggested before by kN bondN but do you think the 
 okay i will see what i can do with the logos i will merge the pages when i have time but if you want to do it yourself before then go right ahead 
 sure no problem i did find an sfN logo but the background wasnt white do you think i can get away with that 
 yeah afd that that has to be bogus anyway i will upload the logo tomorrow 
 its nonsense a dispute like this but this is happen 
 look at 
 just wondering why you replaced 
 thanks for the reply the problem was that the new image didnt work for several templates that are on a large number of pages someone else has reverted it to the original image 
 i dont really have a problem with the color it was proposed a while back but didnt have much support it should probably be discussed first but like i said i dont really care i noticed he didnt change the optional fields though so those are still purple id do it but i dont have the time at the moment 
 i areally think it should be just plain white 
 hi i saw that the william tremblay page had problems so i tried to rewrite it is it ok now thanks 
 sorry but it states that no one should edit it for the time being but you are welcome to contribute to other articles 
 your welcome is there anything you need help with and mdash
 thanks for your help its greatly appreciated but i looked at a couple season N capsules and the area that should be called cultural references has various different names parodies references etc i have been trying to standardize all the capsules which means having the same headings for each so in the future please change the existing titles to fit the format my basic goal is to get every capsule similar and having a trivia and cultural references section and hope that others will fill them thanks 
 whoops sorry i will be sure to do that when i get on to the other seasons 
 horrible timing huh if it is indeed the name of the game then we should probably close the afd vote then do a move or delete with splinter cell N if we can close it technically i think we can speedy delete it as page move but im not really up on the afd process at least concerning admins i have yet to see this name confirmed anywhere are you sure the magazine is stating this as fact the only source i have seen on this is an unofficial fansite which is assuming this is the name due to a recent trademark registering chances are it will be named this but if its not official then we probably shouldnt move it just yet let me know what you want to do if it is named that i will retract my vote 
 the article in question should have its afd closed soon so im sure you can take whatever action is necessary should happen today or tomorrow 
 i have noticed your involvement in minuns request to be unblocked i am leaving this message to respectfully step back from supporting in any of his polls because unfortunately it will only lower others opnions of you userminun was blocked on various accounts including sockpuppetry impersonation harassment and copyright violation happy editing 
 i see your point and i am grateful for your consern poor minun i had no idea that it was this bad copyright violation what drove him to it i wonder however i knew the good minun and i will continue to support him i see that he has done bad to others and the encyclopedia i do not condone this and belive that these actions must have consiquences but the minun i knew was friendly devoted and i know that if the tables were turned minun would be supporting me i do not think he sould be unblocked at this moment but i think leniency and compassion should be expressed as far as i am conserned he is still part of the wikipedia community and i want him to know that he still has friends here i know that minun can change thanks 
 thanks and best wishes 
 in fact i see that you may well have left and that the page in question has been edited without apparent controversy by plenty of other editors since you started it so if you dont mind i will leave it a few days for a response just in case and then change it for you in the hope that this is generally a helpful and positive move if you do mind i will no doubt be hearing from you thanks and best wishes 
 hi again a week has elapsed and i am now changing it per all the above and hope you approve thanks and best wishes 
 have noticed that an editor 
 theres been a bit of this mos silliness in recent months kd lang i believe was renamed kd lang for the same reason ganggajang is verifiably the proper name but i am at tafe so cant easily check sources atm 
 could you please help summarize this i keep telling him its full of grammar errors weasel words and peacock terms yet he still keeps adding it if you could help me summarize the match to be consistent with other matches in the article i would greatly appreciate it thank you 
 i cleared the page 
 bot reverted back a legitimate edit trying to uncensor language issue raised at bots talk page 
 specifically one its uncalled for please step back for a minute and tone it down 
 was outrageously out of line and i do not have to tolerate demanding threats like that by an active administrator on this websiteespecially since he was completely incorrect in his accusation as i never once told that editor that she was a jerk if he not going to apologize for his ungrounded threat then there is no reason for me to not reciprocate in kind i am not this websites punching bag 
 viridae has a point here imo indeed you are still overreacting here honestly listen to bishonen below and step back for a minute 
 no he does not i do not ever have to tolerate admin abuse he not once warn that other editor for his baiting and insults i have every right to defend myself from false accusations and from his harassment and dont lecture me that i dont when i do 
 fine i tried we are done 
 all i am asking is everyone leave me alone and stop misrepresenting me all over the place if i see false accusations about me i will defend myself if these accusations are threatening or abusive or simply wrong i will not tolerate them i have warned three people today to stay off my talkpage and i have no intention of posting to theres again so long as they abide my wishes there are also two banned editors who are editing in violation of their ban and i am trying along with several other editors to assemble the diffs to show that they are indeed ban evaders 
 certainlyi am as always bishonen deeply impressed with whatever you have to say and always do what i can to follow that lead 
 excuse me but why did you remove the links to the article one is a blog from the creators of the show 
 sorry if i sounded a bit harsh on what i said before 
 hello i wanted to let you know that i have done a review of the 
 you probably would have noticed this but after your most recent revisions i have passed this article as a 
 i just cant get through to user 
 what are you talking about 
 you just noted on 
 yes one could guess that but we dont guess around here we require such information on all images you can read some of the discussion about which may make this more clear 
 may i politely suggest writing a faq or asking people to help you write a faq referring back to betacommand again one of the issues there was that he referred people generically to a large set of archives this is fair enough if you are overwhelmed with queries but is still not really fair on the questioner specific answers rather than look at the archives or other discussions are always best 
 salutations thunderbrand me and new user 
 my apologies i was requesting opinions form jacoplane and kN as well and simply copied and pasted forgetting to change the name my mistake anyways concerning the category what category should we use 
 hi jtalledo i noticed you have been editing 
 its too bad you feel that way you do but your edits were clearly not constructive wikipedia isnt the place to state your own personal opinions or make known your insensitivity towards your fellow man see 
 please sign your comments and remember 
 i dont know anything about the town or the people in it but i do know that the edit in question did not belong in the article essentially it said this town sucks which is clearly an opinion 
 yes if everyone you but thats not the case im not the one who needs to get over their biases and prejudices here deal with it 
 well that was no easy task or some of the passages went beyond borderline but i think just barely 
 sorry for the extra work but thanks for cleaning it up 
 a discussion here 
 a survey is now up about it here 
 hi valkarieN astroturfing is neither conservative nor liberal as for the ellie light incident that doesnt qualify as astroturf that was an individual doing a massmailing every letter to the editor was signed by ellie light not by unique names so there was no attempt to appear as many different people and no attempt to appear as a big grassroots effort just one person mailing to a lot of newspapers as for bias im not sure what you are asking care to elaborate regards 
 if the content and numbers of turfing incidents appear to lean to one side or another it is possible that there just happen to be more on one side than the other but feel free to add appropriate and reliably sourced content to balance the article ellie was not intended to appear as different people what other names were used as for claiming different addresses ellie did that to meet the requirements set by the newspaper editors that letters should be from local residents in order to be printed while that is certainly dishonest it is in no way astroturfing and wasnt formally planned by an organization 
 all letters to editors of newspapers are intended to influence opinion and the ellie letters are no different you say it was dishonest but also disguised as spontaneous citizens expressing their opinion it was a citizen expressing an opinion there was no attempt to appear as many people much the same as when a campaign office of a politician emails their talking points to millions of people it goes from one source to many recipients just as the ellie light letter went from one source to many recipients its not astroturf its politics as usual if you could cite some hidden organization or group behind the effort then you might be able to make a case for astroturfing but there wasnt any and that is why the article on it was eventually deleted 
 thanks for helping out with the 
 yeah i noticed that too the only reason i uploaded it was because the original one seemed a bit too low quality for a featured article candidate my copy of the game too is the duller one with the starburst thing so i dunno if there are two covers or it is just an enhanced version maybe we should replace it with one that was scanned 
 i agree that the previous version was too lowres i searched for a better version of the dull version online but couldnt find a good one the brighter version is much more common even appearing on amazon or ign pages if someone could scan in the dull version that would be great 
 tis done 
 ah i see no problem 
 copyright warning removed a different user originally introduced the disputed text 
 hi sorry i didnt realised youd demerged the text from another article at least the 
 or styleverticalalign top bordertop N px solid gray or for your invaluable contributions to evaluating and addressing copyright concerns in 
 closed today whoot thanks so much i hate sports p 
 phew finally thanks for the barnstar 
 hope you enjoy it i will see if i can save 
 gah i know its too addicting even when i go on break i still find myself lingering around oh well nice to see you back so soon 
 im sorry i moved few articles this way before i figured this out as i have read in its quite a complicated process to sort this out so once again sorry 
 can you also read my userpage 
 i agree it should be deleted that said a single admin should not delete something unless it falls within the 
 i remember you listing yourself at the wikiproject since it has been changed you may wish to 
 i just didnt see your name in the category thats all 
 regards and thanks again dennis nilsson 
 now since you placed an mdash on my talkpage i naturally have to ask you when is this is used 
 you wrote that you might change your deletion opinion if i added my sourced claims to the article i have done so 
 see my addition to the 
 i didnt think it could be done well i really didnt think it was plausible but damn you did a really good job converting that roster section to prose great job keep it up 
 yea i prefer the list too but what can you do 
 if you would care to inspect i have added all of the reliable sources i could find within the first N pages of a google search for rio ferdinand height the results may surprise you uN 
 the thing that surprises me is that its different on so many reliable sites it may take some time to figure out the truth 
 i think one thing is certain given the sheer number of sources on each side i think we can safely say that rio ferdinand is not N uN 
 also i have been thinking about becoming an admin for a while do you think its time for me or should i wait 
 thanks for moving that page on the adminshjip i mean i really enjoy cvg stuff because i feelits the subjects on which i have the most knowledge about with the most lack of substance so i dunno do you think it would really hurt me if my focus is on one particular wikiproject i have just been looking forward to being an admin thats all thanks for takign the time to answer my questions 
 is there anything i can do to encourage a greater number of adminsitrators to participate in the rfa 
 i know this is a difficult subject but i am really at a loss as to why such removal of polish names from the lede such as here is necessary why does it matter so much for comparison look at this guys contributions something like N per cent of all his edits involve adding german names to polish places some of which are villages with less than N people yet no polish editor freaks out about it or continuously reverts him or even bothers him hell some of us actually think that those additions of german names might actually constitute useful information but when a polish name gets put into a lithuanian place that has some kind of connection to poland the usual crew of dr dan lokyz and mk automatically show up and start a big fight and now you are enabling them lets not pretend that moving uN awiuN ciany to a names section is anything but an attempt to downplay it as much as possible that would be insulting both our intelligences personally i dont care if there are german or lithuanian names in articles on polish places but what does bother me is this insane double standard herkus spends most of his time putting in german names into polish places and thats par for the course a polish name gets put into a lithuanian place and you get dr dan attacking people and calling them nationalist trolls either or or what pisses me off is the double standard of course what makes matter worse is that those same lithuanian editors show up at any kind of polish or german naming disputes and argue for the inclusion of german names and then they turn around and show up at polish or lithuanian naming disputes and argue for the exclusion of polish names usually using the opposite arguments they just made a second or two ago theres no way to describe it except as mindnumbing hypocrisy and phoniness dont be like them i know you are better than that but sorry until this gets resolved you cant have it both ways if a place in lithuania has a strong connection to poland then it should have the polish name as an alternative name barring that you can try and have the standard wikipedia naming conventions changed and a good place to start would be to revert inclusion of german names in polish places to be explicit at the risk of being well explicit which is sometimes frowned upon on wikipedia there is a matter of intellectual honesty here im putting uN awiuN ciany back in 
 sorry to butt in but since my name is being bantered about here let me be clearer about my position concerning the matter personally places on the border like 
 dan nobody is trying to polonize anything poland and lithuania are tied together through its common history either you like it or not lithuania has endless places and people historically connected to poland and you have to live with it you just removed a polish name 
 look the common history issue is one thing and your erroneous belief that lithuania to the polish state as illustrated by that remark is another you are mistaken and thats probably the heart of the matter and the common history issue would not lend itself to edits like either please dont try to hide behind some policy that is much broader than you are attempting to twist it into like the recent example claiming that the 
 congratulations 
 congratulations and you are very welcome 
 also you are falsely claiming that i am harrasing you and houding you please stop this behaviour 
 whether those claims are false is not up to you to decide just as you deem it your right to insist my behavior constitutes as personal attacks i do reserve the right to also feel insulted offended and harrassed by your behavior so perhaps you would like to take some time for some selfreflection on your own conduct before telling others how to behave 
 maybe you should stop with the personal attacks 
 how about you 
 i can not stop doing something that i have never started to do which im sure you are well aware of your continuing accusations of me making personal attacks are indeed nothing but personal attacks in themselves you are trying to make the attacks milder to see where the limit goes by for example continuing with libelous personal remarks such as this im also interested in where the limit goes lets take your insults through an official process i think its time for that 
 ok i did that here 
 what are you going to do about pushpin_label_position left for east australian towns like brisbane 
 intend to fix but its something id much rather fix when im more well and less likely to screw it up 
 hi im concerned about edits on this article it appears despite my sources provided on the talkpage the anonymous editor that removes them or rebutes them hasnt provided any in his favor according to policy is my stance on this matter incorrect or is his word taken over sources provided for said article i was convinced that my actions were in line with policy and correct fact here seeing as this can still be considered content dispute i have asked a neutral adminstator to become invloved at an attempt to make a final concensus the relevant discussion is on the talkpage if you are interested 
 i agree i placed a man in blacks purposal into effect in the which i think is pretty fair however he reverted me earlier so i not quite sure what this fellow wants we have already acknowledged its not a direct sequel merely an offshoot that incorparates different elements to appeal to a larger audience what do you think of the current version 
 responded on my talkpage and implemented an informal straw poll on the talk 
 oh nevermind the strawpoll another user just implemented a change on the talkpage that i think is pretty good 
 hiya just tossing in my $N though cryptography definitely isnt my #N day job i am still a published author on the subject with a book that is in international release so amateur probably stopped being accurate if not at the time i signed the contract in N then at least when the book was published in early N 
 good points and i do have the utmost respect for martin gardner if its helpful though here are some external sources which use a variation of the term cryptographer or cryptologist and 
 lets see how this goes 
 well heres the thing i have more or less fallen in love with the game its beautifully put together and is a lot of fun i feel that it deserves to be given featured status granted some work does need to be done but thats why we are here after all by the way are you going to be attending 
 when you reverted my edit on the 
 im rather confused uN both you and meteorman are talking about you reverting his edits but hes never edited the page is he one or more of the ips that you keep having to revert i should note i was the admin to whom he reported you no complaints from me about your edits 
 update if you see my edit contribs you will see that i not only fixed that entry i fixed a similar one on a related page job done thx N the catch
 as an aside im not sure the notion of a higher education bubble even makes sense a bubble generally consists of people buying things at a high price expecting to be able to resell them at an even higher price the areselling is a basic characteristic which makes bubbles possible while one can sell the fruits of an education i cant buy your education today hoping to resell your education to someone else tomorrow at a profit 
 no problemo bro always glad to be of good and anonymous help N u here in any case yes that criticism was lobbed a bubble bursts when the commodity is only able to be aresold at a low price and the seller loses but think of it even in the case of an intangible object the areselling of it is still a loose analogy that fits since many college students arent able to get a job then they cant aresell their talents at a price to recoup their loss and insofar as they are hurt the bubble burst there too yes its all a bunch of wordplay gibberish but then again american higher education is a bunch of bull malarkey etc ha ha so junk fits in with junk and its like a phd piled higher and deeper lol ok i have beat a dead horse to death so i will letem rest in peace peace out bro 
 i just started contributing to wikipedia today and your talk page really stood out i dont know if this is the place for it as theres a lot of important stuff here but i figured a compliment was in order 
 i also wanted to give the same compliment your user page was a great deal of help to me with editing and testing my own and it really stands out from the crowd props towards you 
 hi you prodded this as a neologism and as the prod expired i deleted it just now but when i came to look at to see if there was any tidying up to do i found that it is referenced from over a dozen articles and it seems that the term is fairly widely used so i have restored it i am letting you know in case you choose to take it to afd i wouldnt recommend that as though it could do with sourcing it seems to be serving a useful purpose regards 
 i never said the article was an orphan in my proposed deletion rationale and second of all about half those links are related to the show 
 no i wasnt intending to criticise just explaining why i thought on the whole it should stay it isnt one of the newlyinvented neologisms we get so often it has been around some time and it seems to be serving a purpose i agree its uncited and far from an ideal article but zapping it would mean a bit of tidying up all the links to it and on balance i think we are better off with it but feel free to afd if you like regards 
 okay fair enough i was actually thinking about remerging it with 
 i wanted to ask where i might get feedback for a list im compiling i wasnt sure if it would meet the peer review criteria so here i am the article in question is 
 i had it arranged similar to 
 yes thanks for the barnstar and a similar congratulations to you too you had just as much part in making that article so that fa credit is just as much yours as it is mine well done 
 also you might want to update your user pages todo list theres an assignment there that has been completed 
 i take an intrest in disney cartoons and veggietales im trying my to improve articles releated to things i take intrest in for example im working on a new page that you can see in my 
 i asked for adoption for my own good if i make a mistake i hope the adopter can tell me and i wont do it again 
 and no i do not consider you an ahole i just wanted to tell you that the things i did in the past is not what im doing now 
 hey no prob you just scared me there for a second i needed help with 
 i dont need any help with my talk page i can take care of that but look at the page i linked to see what help it needs 
 it needs more info 
 he does seem to be doing it a little less so maybe adoption is what he needs to steer in the right direction ten pound hammer his otters and a cluebat uN (
 sorry ktr no can do i rufuse to tell my age when it come to the internet 
 re anomiebots question on the talk page of 
 doesnt matter to me 
 mediation over two reverts thats the most premature mediation i think i have ever seen i said id get the goddamned citations on thursday would you please instead of carping through unnecessary dispute resolution procedures just put 
 your spectacular failure to handle any step of this in an appropriate manner has frankly made me kind of angry first of all removal of information especially the gratuitously oversized removal you undertook at first without raising the issue on talk and letting some conversation happen is unseemly second of all removal of uncontroversial unsourced material does not have wide acceptance for relatively obvious reasons particularly when nobody disputes the accuracy third of all when an editor asks you to specify what material you want sources on with a template that is designed to mark the information that is in an article and has sources so that any reader can see it and add sources this is prboably not an unreasonable thing to do fourth of all requesitng mediation after two reverts is absurd fifth of all when reverting after an editor has made a token effort to fix the phrasing you are complaining about simply removing N per cent of the phrasing without comment does not give a sense that you are actually interested in compromise or working with other editors sixth of all one generally leaves messages on talk pages not userpages sevent of all when you have done N and managed to piss off an editor your requests for more civility might better avoid adding more straw to an already shattered camel spine if accompanied with perhaps some apology for the preceding despite that your citation is in the article the language is clarified now please try to be more helpful instead of needlessly escelating conflicts and not granting simple requests from your fellow editors mmkay thanks 
 you are angry someone asks for goddamned citations between that and your abusive incivility im asking for more than mediation 
 you havent edited anything mercilessly you have just raised very broad objections and removed huge chunks of things with minimal explanation and to be clear i am not stressed about your asking about the relevance im stressed about almost everything else you have done but not about that im stressed that you ignored simple requests like to use 
 it sounds like you have taken quite the break but im wondering if you can help me fix something that i believe is in dire need of fixing this is a huge problem for the way economic theory is treated in wikipedia the definitions of 
 i have no idea if any of this is helpful but good luck 
 a second thought i hadnt looked at anything youd done before writing the above i just checked out which appears to be your first contribution on the talk page for socialism its too late to make a good first impression but id recommend you do your best while it may be true that the article sucks probably some who read that message worked 
 id say keep arwing landing and maybe the starfox database only because it has the official sf comics but starwing hq doesnt strike me as a valuable fan site especially since it seems that fans of the site are trying really hard to keep it on the page i guess we could use a couple more sites on the page (like the 
 metroid seems like it has too many but i dunno i will think about it later also see my post on the list of star fox planets and locations talk page about venom 
 now that i think about it you are right about the metroid series lets keep it at a maximum of two sites and preferably only one 
 excellent i will get started later today then 
 we are up and rolling see 
 will you be on irc we could get a lot done 
 irc is actually not that complicated i could help you set it up later 
 hi tenebrae im glad you left a message notifying 
 okay thanks 
 i dont know if i have the box anymore let me check around and i will see if i can get something together 
 to be honest im not really up on all the fairuse crap that goes on here can we not use something like as i stated before i dont have my nN boxes anymore hell i cant find any of my games except for goldeneye and zeldamm ( 
 yeah i dont like the list either but you are right its tough with all the different routes i will try to think of something although we can always submit it to peer review now and see what suggestions others may have on that point 
 let me know what you think of all of it 
 i will do it if you think the pr wont do much but wouldnt having a pr open at the moment lessen the chances of it passing i would think that one of the ga editors would wonder why the article is being nominated if the pr isnt done yet but i dont know should we just delete the pr request in that case 
 oh i see well i can also do that if you want but after a quick look it doesnt seem like requests are handled that quickly over there either you want to just wait a couple of days and see if anything comes up on the cvg pr 
 in an attempt to help determine consensus on this matter i have established a poll which you may wish to 
 in attempting to resolve the above matter i have established a straw poll per 
 a straw poll is a quick nasty way of determining feeling on an issue it isnt a good basis on which to act but if acting on the results is not the intention then i dont see any problem with it 
 having taken an extract i have created if you could please fill in the exact source i will try and get it translated out of lithuanian grandiose ( 
 hope you didnt go to too much trouble with the key id done most of it already i have made some posts in some helpful places for the rest there might be more maps i havent worked out exactly what im going for yet grandiose ( 
 take stock of yourself and of the comments you make to people we have all seen the insults you throw on the history page fulminating about the virgin brigade and the awesomeification of your edits seriously im asking respectfully and calmly for two answers and im hoping to use your own phrase you are man enough to give them the two questions are why do you think you have the right to insult people and call them names or to characterize your attempts at editing with such selfaggrandiing and noninformative descriptions tenebrae N N january N 
 i have never done anything on the article except to revert vandalism did i revert someones fixing of the images by mistake if so i apologise but i dont recall doing so 
 no problem 
 fyi just to let you know because he threatened to invite friends to force a consensus on the matter and then deleted a part of my user tlak page in the meantime keep eye out on the page 
 also i want to erase our bickering i feel that we have settled our ridiculous dispute and the discussion page should be about tech and not us going at it backandforth i would be more than happy to copy and paste it under my profile just to keep a record of it alive tell me what you think 
 the truth of the matter is that i extremely envy the neatness of the stuyvesant and bronx science articles if there was some way to make the reference and footnote section cleaner like separate between news articles and regular websites i just feel the lengthy titles to the references makes the section look cluttered 
 i invite you to take this to an admin because i am tired of you constantly dragging this down into childish if you dont stop changing my edits im going to tell on you nonsense please let me know when you have begun the procedure so that i can say my piece to the relative admin

 hey just a heads up before you put the article on ga do you know where 
 yeah thats probably a good idea some of the ga regulars are pretty stringent 
 by the way you may want to take a look at 
 hello i noticed that you spend up to four hours a time working on wikipedia entries i was just curious where you find the time do you go to school do you have a job i dont know anyone that has that kind of time to devote to wikipedia thats great thats dedication keep it up 
 hi tenebrae i have been assigned as the mediator for your 
 i have tagged this article which you had written with referencing and notability concerns with the mind to afd it you might want to take a look at it the main points put forward by an afd would be failure of 
 i dont really mind if it is sent to afd i can see that the comic is really not that notable for a wikipedia article 
 no problem i will probably afd it when i get the time i dont normally inform authors but seing as you linked it from your user page and i have seen you hard at work from time to time in the cvg space that id give you a shout 
 this title from your post entitled you pompous ignorant ass on the 
 well i took your advice to use the what links here option to heart it makes it much easier to see what kind of trash you are talking behind my back 
 my source was the social security death index type in arnold in the last name field everett in the first name field and N for birth year and you get one result i know it isnt definitive because this man could be someone else with the same name but he is born on may N which was listed as his birthdate before i changed the year and as you say the college graduation year would also tend to corroborate my theory anyway do you think this source is reliable enough 
 geez sure do i will add it to the references list thanks for the quick reply and what i suspect will be a great reference source in the future uN 
 no problem and i also have full access to the new york times archives from N to today so if you ever need an article from there i can look it up for you 
 cool nice to see a fellow aficionado of comics history yknow if you register you can add images and do other things thanks again uN 
 im not sure why this isnt something tenebrae considered its been discussed for a long time now on the dd discussion page that pub history is going to be broken into pub history and character history that kind of necessitates that some things from pub history move 
 the thing about letting other editors decide is that theres going to be a bunch of repetition then i mean i guess i can just write my own and if you think its duplicated in yours you can do with it as you see fit and cheers on the footnote 
 hey tenebrae i just wanted to drop a line to find out if the agreement with regards to the dd page has been working out alright if so sometime in the next day or two im going to draw up a final resolution section that will need to be signed by both you and godzillawax either way happy editing 
 hi tenebrae id like to let you know that i have drawn up a final resolution section please read it and if you are uncertian about anything it says please let me know if you do understand and agree to it please sign your name at the bottom where i have indicated thanks 
 fair enough hadnt seen that was making it consistent with the gaming platform articles such as 
 i have taken the step of putting the dates in format to match that specified by 
 or styleverticalalign top bordertop N px solid gray or i award you this for your tireless editing congratulations 
 image placed on my user page 
 no sweat pal no sweat it hardly feels like a year ago i was driving som mad creating stub after stub after stub 
 lol 
 i have noticed you added a tag to the cover art picture 
 btw if mobygames is clearly cited as the source site would this solve the issue thank you 
 thanks for the additional explanation i will replace the picture as soon as i find a nonwatermaked picture with known source thank you for your help 
 the kiwis also have 
 more writing notes than anything else so ask me to elaborate if something needs more clarification in wa edward oldfield was state member for maylands who started as a liberal became an independent who held the balance of power then joined the labor party at a critical time our first labor premier henry daglish did much the same in reverse in N a whole bunch of people switched from labor to national labor > nationalist both at state and federal level around australia john scaddan and john earle in N a similar thing happeend over lang in nsw and sa although those ones generally stayed on the same side of politics at least but just changed party affiliation to lang labor and in N s in especially qld and vic over the movement or dlp split in sa more recently kris hanna started as labor switched to the greens then went independent in qld ronan lee quit labor and joined the greens while the serving member not sure if you could count this but julian mcgaurans much attacked move from national to liberal a couple of years ago as well a few in qld did the opposite just after the N election there i dont have a comprehensive list anywhere those ones are just from memory 
 made 
 garrett switched from nda to labor and ndash 
 although not in office though im not sure if this matters 
 do you have confirmed information on whether 
 nope i dont have any information i added the category simply because the article refers to him in the present tense anyway i think that when in doubt its best to have the category after all for any biography you can never be sure that the person is still alive right now so the category really just means last we heard he was still alive 
 i reverted a couple of changes you made at 
 okay i put my sources up on the talk page so we can work out how best to phrase the claim 
 hmm i hadnt created a bot the overlinkage must have been human error on my part my mistake though thanks for pointing it out 
 no problem 
 i was made an admin gosh it feels like ages ago maybe november last year it seems like wikipedia has changed a lot since then and im slowly managing to draw myself back to comics related stuff i have contacted someone about getting a will eisner picture released into a license we can use for the 
 glad you like 
 yikes as far as i was aware different from and different to are good english while different than is incorrect i was under the impression that different from or to were used worldwide and that different than was just an americanism that had appeared recently if thats not the case id better stop making those changes thanks for the headsup 
 thanks for doing the research after making some of the changes i was thinking that doesnt look right now i know why oh well redoing some of those wont harm my edit count one bit thanks again 
 where did you find out that ken leung is playing kid omega instead of quill because in the trailer and i think a tv spot is shows him with quills power 
 thanks i assume you were referring to the critical reaction section that was inserted into the article i think that most critical reaction sections should be removed anyway or limited to a a few lines placing detailed analysis of what someone thought about a movie is so obviously pov but yet seems to make its way into a lot of film pages i think those sections can be summoned up with simple statements on whether the majority of critics like it hated it or were mixed about it 
 oh and also 
 sorry to bother you with this again but the relevant talk page pertaining to 
 i have no problem with this being deleted its not showing up so i just uploaded the pic again at a different name im not sure if there is a tag i canut on showing i support its deletion 
 yeah 
 its my pleasure to notify you that consensus being reached you are now a 
 oh and thanks for fixing my wiki markup i cant believe i didnt notice that its midly embarassing 
 um i dont see where i have that picture on my user space 
 oh sorry i copied the userbox for a draft i didnt take out the image 
 im sorry you feel that respected reviewers including variety and the hollywood reporter along with a british critic and a critic who was also a comics writer constitutes bias im requesting arbitration and reporting your incivility 
 is that a threat your arbitration request would be silly and most likely rejected especially because you are the one inserting bias into an article 
 you are right i didnt do it maliciously i was simply trying to keep them together so that they made a bit of sense when you were reading 
 its no problem 
 lol ok even that was a little childish 
 well depending on how you word it i think that a review section can cause problems like the ones we are having its hard to take in everyones opinion there are too many critics out there to accurately take care of that and you are always left with an unneutral bias by incorporating selective quotes from reviewers especially those directed specifically at people instead of at the film as a whole you create bias i dont care if that is in a positive light or a negative light you can have a review section as long as you keep it clean and selective quotes is not going to help that situation 
 that is why i said that unless it is clear which it is not for this particular movie then it should be limited in the case of fN th that is clear that is was panned almost completely i think that a review section is important if there is something that surrounds it that should be noted fN th series has a cult following but the viii movie is noted as one of the worst in the series the last stand has been criticized ruthlessly when refering to ratner and those it is of no surprise that those opinions would stay the same when the film came out you cant tell me that there isnt a bias in reviews when there is constant apprehension for a filmmaker a distaste at the fact that the previous director left on such a high note and are dislike for the new ones previous films people cannot help their own biasis its natural to always think about those things that is why i think that this particular movie article does not fair better with a review section because there will be too much bias no matter what the direction 
 i think i have cleaned up what you were concerned about manufacturer is no longer used in place of boulton and i got rid of a bunch of the uses of his name substituting generally he would it matter if he was an author seamstress or astronaut or something else shorter than manufacturererer 
 this is just my opinion but i do not like any alternative terms for the main person the article is about in one of your california politician articles your referred to the same person as the attorney the californian the political strategist etc i do not find other articles on people doing this i may be wrong but i find it confusing it always causes me to stop and think who is being referred to here regards and mdash 
 fair enough but then i got people complaining i was using the name too much rock and a hard place i think it comes from me writing one sentence at a time and my seventh grade english teacher always said have a subject in your sentences 
 boy i was all settled down with a glass of wine to polish the nixon election articles and maybe start on khrushchev and then this comes up well i dont think its that serious but it could delay promotion 
 i dont thing the objection is significant and you have five supports perfection is not an achievable goal however god knows who has a figure on the scales im having my glass of wine and awaiting my books and mdash 
 ps im found a great stress reducer is to edit on the french or spanish wiki and mdash 
 unfortunately my spanish is not idiomatic enough to pass hopefully the bio of nikita will come tomorrow i have everything else 
 i know of argentosuspiria is what hes really noted for 
 hahawell as soon as i get the chance i will be sure to watch it i have a rather large collection so im always looking for an excuse to add to it i still havent finished the universal collection i get sidetracked and watch other movies that i buy oh btw i apologize for any offense that i may have caused with any sarcastic remark that i made i also apologize for that other user spouting off he was a little out of line i just never really understood the point of a review section because we are adding a section that consists of opinions when we go about the rest of the article trying to remove them i dont think that just because someone is paid to voice their opinion that we should feel compelled to include it in the article an opinion is an opinion whether you get paid for it or not its a little bit of hypocracy to include an opinion section into an article where you fight to remove pov from the rest of it 
 im trying to figure out what he did differently from any of the other editors continually arguing about the south ossetia war sure he argues passionately for his viewpoint but hasnt everyone that was involved in that article done so including myself 
 i think the opinion of future perfect the blocking admin was that he was deliberately slow edit warring whatever that means its not a policy my opinion was that he didnt do anything wrong but he might be seen as too prorussian maybe ask the blocking admin for more info i dont know but i feel that since the admin has been arguing on the page in the past against hw hes an involved editor and should not have been the one to make the block but that just me 
 sorry that wasnt me i didnt do anything to avengers united we stand aloso please sign your posts its a dash followed by N tildes thanks 
 its not i went to that entrys history page at http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlethe_avengers_united_they_stand and limitN and actionhistory and a word search did not find tenebrae on the list also i will erase any entry on my talk page that is unsigned so please sign your comments 
 s or he responded on my talk page and i left a follow up on hir talk page on how it could have been handled differently theres a bit there for you too just trying to keep us playing nice 
 glad it was helpful its a lot easier to be calm and evenhanded when im not involved in the edits if you need assistance in the future just let me know 
 yes i believe you are correct in your interpretation of the policy however im not N per cent sure what issue you are refering to would it be possible to clarify thanks dude 
 sounds good 
 as you created and have edited 
 reading your help desk comment im totally confused now was it N or N 
 there is no acceptance of the semicolon that is the proper punctuation for that sentence what you are doing is diliberately undermining my edit because you dont like someone correcting you the arelunctantly is placed with the stabbing because that is what is relunctant she has to die there is no other option the only part that bothers him is that he has to do it he cant use the cure for one he doesnt even know if it ould work on her being as she is so powerful and two he cant get to the cure killing her is the only option thus he relunctantly stabs her with his claws because he doesnt want to have to kill her himself he loves her and it pains him to have to stab her when he stabs he is going for the kill he has N claws all of which are the size of butcher knives i dont think there is a lot of dilly dally when it comes to being stabbed by all of them hence why he is relunctant to stab her just because you place the relunctant to end her life in the front doesnt change the meaning of relunctance in that section her death was inevitable there was no relunctance to it the only relunctance was in who would have to kill her and that resided with wolverine saying relunctantly stabbing her with his claws ending her life ending her life was going to happen either way bignole N N june N 
 as you can see this isnt about preference for what to say its is wrong when you analyze the scene and take that into consideration when you are writing then you cannot say relunctantly ending her life because that isnt describing the scene accurately her death is inevitable the reluctance is in the stabbing chris is spitefully editing that because i corrected him on his use of a comma in place of a semicolon the two sentences shouldnt be separated because they are share a relationship and the appropriate punctuation for that is a semicolon he didnt like that so now he is purposefully editing the sentence which changes the meaning when you place relunctantly with ending her life it doesnt create the same meaning as placing it with stabbing her with his claws the from the film is about his relunctance to kill her himself not with her having to die if it was something else then it would be a preference but when you have to take into consideration the actual scene from the movie his wording is incorrect 
 thats just it relunctantly isnt describing the stabbing relunctantly is describing the emotion as he stabs her death is going to happen regardless unless he would rather the whole world end but if you place relunctantly with ending her life then you are missing the meaning behind him killing her with that version you are saying that she relunctantly has to die which isnt true because there is no relunctance about itshe has killed scott the prof and countless others so there is no ifs ands or buts about it she has to die so we are left with who has to do it and wolverine seems to be the best candidate but he loves jean thus his emotions tell him that even though she has to die he would rather die in her place hence we have relunctantly stabs her ending her life 
 the dispute isnt about whether or not to use reluctantly or stabbing the dispute is to where reluctantly goes im not sure what compromise you are proposing you will have to illustrate a sentence yourself for it to be clear 
 finally why wont you respond to me i have written to you several times on your user page and you only seem to want to talka round me to tenebrae imm not sure how i was supposed to know you were writing to me on another editors talk page 
 momentarily gaining control jean begs wolverine to save her wolverine reluctant to end jeans life himself tell her he loves her and stabs her with his claws now the reluctance is with ending jeans life but it still conveys the message the wolverine is relunctant to kill her not that there is some relunctance in her life ending that was what was not being grasped you are saying there is some reluctance in her life ending but i think you mean to say that there is reluctance in him killing her notice the word usage in your version and mine you were not emphasizing that anyone was reluctant to kill her you were emphasizing that she was reluctant to die 
 i noticed you are listed as having a number of the game informer issues from late N and early N and i believe one of them has game informers top N games of N although i am unsure which issue very possibly the january issue of N if you know anything or could even have a look it would be great to use as a reference for 
 much appreciated take as long as you need thanks 
 after navigating through wiki i finally found the right person to ask i think this goes along with 
 thanks for the info much appreciated 
 hi i was wondering if i could get your input on 
 the image should be kept film posters or cover art are allowed for identification per 
 thanks for your take on this 
 her death is not reluctant to be reluctant it has to be unwilling how can her death be unwilling the point is to emphasize the fact that wolverine himself is reluctant to kill her it isnt her death that is reluctant it is the fact that he is doing it you are seeing the fact that the word is with stabbing her and assuming that he is reluctant to stab her he is reluctant to stab her but it isnt the stabbing that he cares about its her death she has to die but he doesnt want to have to kill her that is why he is reluctant to stab her you wouldnt be reluctant to die you would be reluctant to be killed better yet you wouldnt be reluctant to extinguish life that needs to be extinguished you would be reluctant to do it yourself there was no question to the fact that she has to die the question was in whether or not he wants to do it you are either missing the point or completely ignoring it you keep modifying her life but you should be modifying his action what is in question is whether he wants to do it or not not whether she deserves it that is why i worded as such originally then so that you can have your reluctant with jean i worded it so that it made sense that way wolverine reluctant to end jeans life himself the reason this isnt a preference is because you are ignoring the actual scene in the film and creating your own meaning in the film they hinted at the fact that she would need to die almost from the start then right before they left for alcatraz island storm talked with logan about whether he is prepared to do what needs to be done hello that is her telling him that jean needs to be killed that is why when you say reluctantly you would need to modify logans emotions not jeans death if you dont specify that in the sentence then you cant assume that your original sentence structure creating the meaning that her death was reluctant not that wolverine was reluctant to kill her 
 im sorry but not really you still dont seem to relaize that the way it is now reluctantly is modifying jeans death and not wolverine killing her there is nothing in the sentence right now that specifies that he is reluctant to kill her it says relunctantly ending jeans lifethat creates the question what was reluctant to end jeans life just because you already know the answer the question doesnt mean that what is written there actually provides that answer its clear that he doesnt want to kill jean but she must die so he reluctantly does so unfortunately the sentence creates an ambiguity because it doesnt actually say that it just says reluctantly ending jeans life wolverine tells jean he loves her and stabs her all three of us already know that wolverine is reluctant to kill her and not that she is reluctant to die but that isnt what the sentence says you have to look beyond hindsight and actually read the sentence the way it is written it creates a new question of reluctantly what chris and i both want the same meaning to show that he reluctantly kills her first it wouldnt sound right if it was about her relunctantly dying thats like saying she was standing there thinking it over before she decided to just keel over so that is how i know we must be looking for the same answer the problem is that when you know what you want you dont see what the problem is you cant understand how N +N if you already know that N is the answer you will just always say N is the answer without actually understanding why that is the problem with the sentence you know the answer but the question is wrong that was why i rewrote it so that it asked the right question which was was wolverine killing her in cold blood or for some other reason also i just noticed it says kills her with his clawsthat is a bit redundant if you are already saying that he ends her life that was the reason we used stabbed before because you already acknowledged the fact that he is ending her life so if you say he kills her then there is no point to say ending her life because you are just overflowing the gas tank maybe if chris wants killed it should be more like wolverine telling jean he loves her relunctantly kills her with his claws 
 was pchan reading your talk page or do we just think alike 
 thats sad but unfortunately we dont talk in person and its hard to explain things in N lines otherwise we just have a prepetual cycle of misunderstanding 
 i dont need you to read back my edit summaries to me i know what i wrote just because you didnt understand it doesnt mean it was nonsensical and mdash 
 your accusations are false and completely inappropriate you are flying off the handle on one edit i made i dont appreciate your rudeness and unwarranted attack i dont know what edit war i just stumbled into but i was just reading men of tomorrow when i noticed your revert so i thought id pipe up you cant start threatening to block people just because they make edits you dont like i suggest you find something else to do until you can calm down and try to think a little about my edit summary it was absolutely appropriate if a bit oblique you will get the point eventually and mdash 
 ps i really shouldnt give this the dignity of a response but i will point out that N is in hicksville new york and im in chicago as you can tell if you look at my homepage and mdash 
 indeed happy wbirthday from me as well also should you submit an rfa in future please let me know i dont vote very often but you would have my support 
 the same highly controversial edit without citation that was never made on the page before was suddenly made three times in N hours by three users including two new users 
 its not highly controversial you just disagree with it look heres what happened i think 
 other users im glad to see you admitting that you dont actually believe 
 i should have said other alleged users my apologies for lack of clarity and there is still the meat puppet issue in any event you have deleted posts 
 opossums and possums are different and largely unrelated animals they belong to different orders of marsupialia 
 good idea 
 im going to respectfully decline the wikihalo i voted for the awards deleteion so i feel its bad form to accept one also i have noted you have commented text out of the 
 apology your placing of some lines of text in quotation marks led me to believe they were direct quotes that was not the case and it was my summarising of the points campbell made that were at fault i retract the part about the direct quotation and offer my sincere apologies for jumpijng the gun the html commenting out confused me somewhat as to what had happened 
 hi leftorium you are incorrect on your assumption im an avid cricket fan and so is my family however the picture i have of 
 because i have uploaded the images onto my flickr account and sell some of them to these websites these are my images im the holder and the flickr one wa a freebie the others i have sold of eg cricistan is a website used by pakistanis to find information about their cricket team 
 the name is paddynapper 
 why should i i only want them to be used on wikipedia because its there with my knowledge and has my full consent im happy with the content on my flickr account if i do change the rights then it could be used on other websites i dont want that these are my pictures i own them and have there rights there are many other notable paksitani crickters whose pictures i dont have eg 
 if your point is correct then in the image licensing why is there an option that says all rights reserved so if your point is correct why is that option available if i change the licensing of the images to all rights reserved and the content still cant be used by anyone but me you are incorrect in the licensing saga as well 
 no thats not correct i can provide copyrighted images of a person because i own those images they are under my control it doesnt say that in the terms and conditions 
 have a look at this example http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or filesebastian_vettel_cracowjpg he is a living person and his image has been copyrighted 
 i see in that case i will change the license to all rights reserved for certain images which are more valuable to me than others eg mohammad sami and mohammad aamer as i have spent more time taking a good picture 
 yes i can i own them show me where it says that specifically in the terms and conditions i can reserve the rights of my image its my freedom and my right you cant take that right from me and it doesnt exist in the wikipedia terms and conditions i have sent you an example of sebastian vettel above there are many other images with a same setting as mine 
 hey just so you know i think 
 thanks for the infomation regarding mary anne hobbs i actually caught that account in the new user log 
 thanks for the rollback 
 you are welcome also i too believe that your next rfa should be successful dont worry i didnt pass my first rfa either 
 sometimes fanboys can just get too enthusiastic i dont remember fictional mutates being deleted but im all in favor of it going away after this latest round of additions everybody whos every undergone a superpowered change qualifies at this point i do have to disagree with the lgbt comics characters though i think theres enough entries to justify spliting them when you add the two theres almost N entries about the point i start thinking about splitting anyway 
 dont listen to this guy absorbing man got his powers from loki that should tell you how crazy covenantd is areally crazy 
 chris i hope you are kidding about the crazy remark i dont think youd like people to call you that would you 
 note i was being absurd 
 hey weyward why did you delete the 
 and 
 someone else or myself would soon supply the text 
 hate to bother you ten but i think your vote on the punisher maxpunisher merge thing is a little ambigous i think you are voting for keep but as you dont actually write that im not sure how your vote will be counted again my apologies if this seems like hair splitting to you 
 hah just realised oppose merge is more appropriate than keep so your vote was actually clearer than mine after all no worries 
 hey not bad the guy who was the first jack olantern actually became the second hobgoblin later on but im named for the cooler second jack olantern who came around in N 
 maybe not an xmen guy myself so i dont know 
 congratulations the article 
 thanks for the review and the helpful comments 
 are you not going to create a request for checkuser because if you are not i am just going to close the suspected sock puppet case 
 ahh i see ok so i suppose the sock puppet case can be closed now thanks 
 i dont understand why you deleted the table i created for adventure into fear detailing issue titles and creative teams you say table belongs in morbius article not in adventure into fear article but i strongly disagree the issues listed were the only ones i own or else i would have detailed the entire run can you honestly say the article is better off without this information 
 i hope this helps happy wikiing 
 when you say wikipedia style is thus and so you are pointing to the current state of various articles not to any policy i am aware of besides my edit was about the series individual issues not about morbius per se lastly you still havent answered by question as to how the article benefits from having less detail 
 the current state of articles is one thats evolved through a lot of dedicated editors over the course of months or years theres additionally 
 it is evident that we are not going to come to an agreement i will solicit opinions elsewhere thank you for your time 
 hi intersofia the article 
 are you confusing 
 done article recreated with literary and photographic 
 please feel free to contribute to the article 
 note despite his protestations the stories in the last are morbius stories easily checkable 
 the difference of opinion is whether descriptions of adventure into fear belong in the adventure into fear article regardless of who is depicted in the issues listed so far this topic is being discussed at length 
 im about to go to bed myself but if you report him i will endorse it 
 um a bit more to the east im in 
 hi just wanted to let you know that disceptation is in fact a word i will not get up in arms about it just try to do some fact checking next time 
 my apology i did however try to look it up it does not appear in my print edition of merriamwebster and through that dictionary company turns out to be only available at the subscriptiononly merriamwebsterunabridgedcom i think we can agree that such an obscure word may not be the clearest form of expression 
 no problem thanks for apologizingi apologize too for using such an obscure word although that was the first befitting word that came to mind 
 just so it doesnt surprise you at some future date though i have serious reservations about the idea of featuring a porn bio however wellwritten on the main page i understand completely wpnot censored and no subjectmatter limits to content but the firestorm that would come down on the project from putting jj on the main page just doesnt seem worth it to me im open to persuasion that im misguided on this of course but feel free to hold off on responding to this comment until the rfa is over if you like regards 
 getting fa status doesnt mean that a page will automatically feature on the front page sometime in the future raul maintains a list of fas that will never appear as to whether that page would be on that listwell its not my list but that aside theres no reason why a wellwritten informative item on any subject should be denied fa status 
 thanks for butting in thats very helpful information i have no problem with this or any articles being featured per se it was specifically the idea of having it automatically pop up on peoples homepages at work school etc that concerned me it wouldnt offend me but well just close your eyes and imagine what mainpage talk would look like that day but of course now you have me curious where can i find this list of articles that are excellent enough to be featured but will never grace the front page 
 i think raul has it written on a piece of paper somewhere so as not to cause a polemic over why suchandsuch an article is on the list he occasionally lets slip on what might be on it (
 or nodding or thanks that reminds me of a few days ago when there was a heated dispute over editing of the fuck article that was the subject of a long threat on ani i believe the dispute is resolved now but at the time i remember thinking to myself that would be an interesting addition to the list of arbitration cases 
 i think it would be ok to feature jj on the front page but her picture may not be provocative i dont mean she has to be clothed i mean she has to be areally clothed 
 on second thought lets table this discussion for a week or so regards 
 you can read on the template do not remove this notice from pages that you have created yourself if you created this page and you disagree with its proposed speedy deletion please add i would thank you to please revert your removal of the template and add the hang on as is stated on the template ta 
 your edit is in breach of guidelines please revert it ta 
 actually english is my first language and as this is a wiki you may go ahead and change things as you wish i will not reverse my edits but i wont edit war with you either my opinion is that science fiction does not have to be hyphenated and i also dont agree that this is a black and white rule of english grammar (why dont we see 
 as i stated before i do not wish to discuss this further this is a wiki and i have stated before that i will not edit war with you and you are free to revert my edits as you wish i even encourage you to acquire 
 i have never ever removed anyones comments dont you dare accuse someone falsely 
 no proof yes you are let me ask you something did you run across the term edit conflict at any time you were writing something on that talk page 
 yes i did id suggest you demonstrate convincingly you did not know you were removing my comments whilst editing i maintain my accusations we will talk again tommorow 
 look lets just drop this if my sockpuppet belief was a misunderstanding based on a suspicious interpretation of evidence i apologize if you are good with that and you are willing to do likewise about your accusation i will go formally withdraw my complaint 
 your sockpuppet belief is indeed a misunderstanding as for my accusation i am willing to apologize for it when you have withradwn your complaint 
 likewise i formally withdraw my complaint and i apologize for my original assumption 
 thanks hibana i was actually looking into that very issue as we certainly dont need an entire section devoted to the pc version i was thinking of doing something similar with what we did for final fantasy viiis pc version i just need to see if theres really much notable information to say about it and make sure i have the appropriate references this also reminded me that i forgot to ever put refs on the pc info for viii so i need to fix that too and refs for the sgi demo on final fantasy vi one thing leads to two others ( 
 i think this is going to be my last one hibana im already feeling burned out and i have only taken care of one section 
 i appreciate that 
 thanks for the concern but now that i have gotten started id be more frustrated if i left the job half done thats the problem with me beginning something N per cent of things probably get ignored by me but that N per cent that gets my attention really gets my attention though lately its more like N per cent of things getting my attention i admit i really have been spreading myself a bit thin but after final fantasy vii is done im done i have got to get back to work in a couple of weeks anyway so i should hopefully be done by then anyway 
 i teach at a high school now officially as a regular rather than just a sub the vacations just about over for both of us huh 
 thanks for your support i sent the whole package over to an administrator that i share some interests with and hope that he will step in as much as he can i will keep you up to date as you say i dont want to make an enemy of an adminstrator either but there are bad apples in every barrel a couple days ago i ran across a wiki site that listed admins who had been banned or blocked or stripped of their rank so it can happen not in a case as minor as this i would say but maybe it will make her think twice the next time before doing such a sweeping edit 
 righto i thought that was a very good message you left she obviously thinks she can stick her head in the sand and that the situation will vanish i will goose my admin that i sent all the stuff to and see if he will do anything he was away on vacation for a while and is still catching up 
 could you read the 
 having it set to minor doesnt make it correct did you have a look at the minor edit page or perhaps ask your mentor about it 
 it is not a matter of making mistakes once in awhile as you have stated you have your edits set to default minor and you say you know what a minor edit is and yet you continue to make major edits and leave the setting as minor please mark major edits as such 
 theres no need to draw nonresponsive anon editors to arbcom it appears he has never been blocked at all bringing this to the attention of an admin on 
 i blocked 
 hes only inserted the link once today and hasnt added it back even after it was reverted i will keep an eye on his contribs and if he starts up again like he did two days ago i will get rid of him again 
 oh in the event that i forget or im not online at the time feel free to warn the guy with and and have the guys over at 
 still thanks for sharing thoughts 
 so you mean to say we cant quote a direct source of statement of a person as exactly as it is even when the person who said it doesnt even know or lack the knowledge where the classic came from d 
 i think normal criminals is direct to the point or how about while the punisher most often fights nonsuperhuman criminals a bit complex though thoughts 
 lol actually i cant find any characters to use as my siggy p anyways i dunno about the superhuman word as directed to bullseye i only changed the word superpowered to superhuman which are relatively the same if you have any idea what it should be called then feel free to alter 
 an edit on my watchlists beer and breweries in poland was right next to your talk page edit how appropriate the bloody hungarian firefox and this dammned keyboard will probably kill my polish category tagging for the mo we most likely gonna get snow tommorrowthat will sort out whther my scottish cold weather gear works cheerski 
 haha ouch its actually been nice here today well apart from the behaviour of our premier glad to hear you are enjoying the place even if your zs are ys and vice versa i have fond memories of my travels in that part of the world 
 im starting to wonder if mr woo deserves an article of his own aside from his background with the 
 in reply yeah i think hes probably worth it offhand we have got the yellow claw original stories the agents of atlas the nick fury vs shield appearance whichever tale it was that resurrected him after his death in that and a bunch of appearances in godzilla to judge by his if clay quartermain qualifies for an article i think jimmy does too hes not purely a shield or fury supporting character and not purely a yellow claw character either which probably adds to the case 
 please do not respond in any way to the oppose #N you have written way too much as it is please 
 no modern rfa is complete without a personal diatribe and now yours has one i concur that no response is necessary your record speaks for itself and the concerns expressed seem minor in comparison to your contributions 
 wait i got an oppose i must commit seppuku immediately 
 hrr i read it and not responding is harder than i thought it would be its not a silly diatribe its an intelligent detailed and reasonably respectful and well thought out objection i wont change the users mind but i do think it does deserve a response just out of courtesy maybe on the talk page i will give you two a chance to convince me otherwise 
 seppuku seems excessive i think chopping of your tail and rubbing ashes in your bellyfur would be sufficient i used diatribe in reference to the length of the comments not their content which is indeed intelligent and wellwritten some of the criticisms seem to revolve around the idea that while you have done good work there is still more to do and therefore you shouldnt be an admin i wouldnt bother responding to that at all however a brief explanation regarding the situation with 
 do it offwiki 
 the individual who keeps doing that now says it in other ways but keeps saying the same stuff he or she or it doesnt edit so frequently that three pop up within the same N hour period it might be twice in one day a day or two might pass in between but good grief this has been going on since last month anyway thats why i pointed this out on the project talk page which is exactly where i first learned about this mess myself 
 actually what id really like to see some additional input on is a weird edit war going on in the 
 are there subscriptions available for this magazine if so how much and how do i find them a cursory google search didnt turn up anything for me 
 thanks 
 at this point my preference would be to undo the edit you made and bring all the spot images based on full covers in to a consistent format the link box is to me the lesser of the aesthetic and graphic design faux pas uN 
 am i missing something that you are seeing in your browser uN 
 it has been a pleasure hopefully we will see more of each others edits uN 
 it took along itme but it is finally done i have cleared the three day backlog of scv 
 wow nice work thanks 
 on a final note i noticed your kudo for my creation pf digger in that pages history thank you very much 
 on a second note i have posted a question about diggers skin colour in tower of shadows on the 
 thanks for the responce rueful laugh is right 
 one final note on this i just added a section mentioning his skin colour i figured id run it by you just to be sure its an accurate statement 
 thanks for improving the article but im also having trouble regarding its categoryinnovaton publishing how do you add the name of the company to the category lists there are other titles innovation published and surely they need to have a category of the publication company thanks 
 thanks for a very prompt reply actually david campiti visited my country to conduct his comics creation seminar last october N maybe you can start an article about him he hold N glasshouse graphics studios N in brazil and N in my country philippines 
 lol yes whats your country im from the philippines btw i really dont know how to add the innovation publishing category can you do it for me pls if youll notice the 
 later bro 
 part of christianity is acceptance correct please consider considering the opinions of those around you so that you can better communicate your own message without hostility 
 i appreciate your advice sir 
 partly my fault i should have given a more detailed analysis of what was up i still think we should keep our hands off the undo button after we see somebody make the first revert though 
 a tricky call when an ip persistently introduces a blp violation sbs has dealt with the worst of the edit will leave it alone for now 
 okay i have blocked you for N hours i think that takes you up until the end of the week im going to raise this at the admins noticeboard because this is out of process and against current practise but im ignoring all rules at the moment and we will see what happens from there you may find a consensus rules the block cant stand but im going to argue strongly on a couple of counts that we should consider the idea namely in assuming good faith and also possible publicity concerns take it easy

 ok i rarely use email under this same name you can find me at srwiki if you want you can contact me there of course im planning to vote as soon as i can see that it started 
 well it is not a voting process of the kind of the move request ones it is just in the talk page of 
 one last note thank you for your words about the article on timmy the timid ghost 
 wow quick responce on your part you wanted me to check out those three articles you created i liked all three i get a kick out of reading the history of the comic book medium 
 the title should have been hyphenated it was an oversight that it wasnt according to the 
 then why dont you change move the article named 
 because african american isnt modifying anything the phrase africanamerican man uses the term as a compound modifier no biggie 
 please see 
 i believe it is if you are registered as 
 have you emailed 
 im aware of it 
 as is obvious by now im aware of it admin noticeboard entry too and yes i was the one who put it the notice up at 
 you have any talents at putting together comic like graphics the concept is to sort of parody barnstars as a wet diaper award sort of thing to motivate people to work at better documentation trails when leaving the various types of inyourface banner templates like clean mergeto merge move etc where most of the time no one pays attention to the implicit directive in the template to document their justification in the talk despite the link overtly given in the template while a chide also want to interject some fun in the slap on the face hence my first title was wet noodle award which isnt funny at all in a first draft but does a pretty good job at getting out why i think this is a good idea see 
 well i was drawing a distinction between graphics skills and knowledge about the former i can find easier than the later which isnt the same importance as perhaps one who knows what makes them tick and can perhaps visualize and describe one or three ideas that seem to promise humor if implemented for others to draw up but see the remarks quiddity and i just exchanged on that talk page i may be reinventing the wheel here right now im heading to bed or or 
 that last comment you mentioned seemed pretty actionable to me but it also seems like it was added by after which planetsaturn unless im missing something if anybodys being a really consistent problem especially if they do so without providing anything of substance im always happy to help its not so clear cut in this case though people are unfortunately almost bound to make offcolor comments in arguments if you can find a pattern of excessively severe comments or if you can find an admin who draws the line different than i do or if you can provide me with more serious 
 i think you are looking at the wrong section the dispute between myself and tenebrae can be found primarily in the section titled hardcover id link it properly but my skill in that area is poor im sure tenebrae can direct you more properly himself later 
 i just noticed the bit tenebrae was pointing you to on your talk page you are right that was not me who made that statement as you suggest i was the one trying to calm that user down during that unrelated discussion 
 did we agree to keep all members together for 
 meh i thought we did talk about it either that or it was like a unwritten thought any way i will put something on his page about that stuff you mentioned along with a thanks for all that info he added 
 its preferable on wikipedia to comment on the article rather than the user you may need to refresh yourself of 
 calm it down a little and let it runs its course remember we comment on the issue not the user im well aware of whose making which comments and lets just remember the important thing is a good article i have email enabled anytime you want to vent offwiki about anything 
 cheers i think this will play out through the dispute resolution process and end at the ultimate step but that involves everyone and everyones edits come into play 
 that was yesterdays project and it did take all day long i used all the information but there still is a lot of holes though thanks a lot 
 glad to see you like 
 thx 
 i thank you mr thornton happy christmas to you 
 another user placed the photograph upon my page sir but it was reverted i restored it since it had been intended as a compliment to apparently my religiosity and morality out of curiosity do you think that it would improving the look of this talkpage if i placed the image of odin the wanderer upon it 
 hey the nungarin stuff arrived today i dont know how much is usable though it is just a tourist brochure but has some info and the shire logo of course 
 already one step ahead of you mate the lady said she would talk to some people there and see if they could do that at worst they can send the pictures to you or me but i dont know what the copyright situation is even if they say its ok 
 hi tenebrae the work you did on the wonder woman section was superlative your suggestions for techniques and copyediting styles are invaluable with regards to bright college student that would have been eight years ago my goal was to be a broadcast journalist but never got past anything local i currently do sales and marketing but wikipedia has renewed my love of journalism cheers 
 me too im applying to columbia school of journalism 
 hi tenebrae the image was untagged for more than seven days so that image qualifies the criteria for speedy deletion there was no license information on the image page thats why unfortunately i had to delete the image if you can provide the whole license information with proper tag i could restore the image regards 
 i would appericiate your efforts but you may consider uploading free images on 
 the reason why i closed your rfa early was because there was frankly no possible way that you would have recieved an N per cent consensus you had N oppose votes to zero support votes assuming you received no additional oppose votes you would require an absolute minimum of N support votes to reach an N per cent support rate there was no reasonable chance of you reaching that and as such i exercised my bureaucratic privileges and closed the rfa early if you want editors critique your actions and your edits on wikipedia you may want to consider 
 how do you do young man you are probably correct but there was still a slight possibility nonetheless i appreciate your advice 
 let me give you some good advice on how to go about doing much better on wikipedia i think you are far too proud and outspoken to fit in on wikipedia i am giving you this advice for your own benefit its your choice whether or not you take it if you want to be more liked you need to try to work on your articles in facts not just searching for facts on wikipedia which contravene your own moral standards or opinion i also suggest that you refrain from speaking in such a formal tone it does come across as highly patronising this includes your addressing of people by sir and madam and your use of inverted commas around peoples nicknames i understand that the language you use to communicate on wikipedia is used in 
 i give up on this article people have read the original version of the lead o much that they are completey blind to any faults it has and are starting to make personal attacks on anyone who tweaks it im giving it a few months to see if it settles down theres also a bit of a 
 good idea to leave it be for a while uN its extremely sensitive and while obvious vandalism is easily dealt with a great deal of effort and patience is needed to make any changes if you are at a loose end 
 sorry but what claim to notability its founder is dick hubbard who stepped down as ceo from N to serve as the mayor of auckland is the nearest thing and so he stepped down to become mayor whats that got to do with the notability of the company thats him personally the article is just a vanity or spam thing which i have been watching for a while theres no attempt to reference it and it consists mainly of a product list 
 also theres a coi username been editing there recently i say vanity 
 replied at your talk page 
 article looking better now i do this sometimes to stir people into action speedy and afd work the best prod doesnt seem to have the same impact btw i dont patrol new pages as such i patrol new accounts which isnt quite the same i do patrol new account userpages which until mean as custard came on the scene were rather neglected 
 hi sup sorry about the removal of the comicbook screenshot of the punisher or archie crossover but when 
 btw you might also want to consider to putting the image to a proper location i find its position to be awkward inside the article thanks 
 thanks btw im at work right now btw can you pls review the views of the criminal justice system section also i would love to hear your opinion regarding the other version of the punisher pls see talk page thanks 
 hello seraphim i should notify you that you are in dangerof violating the 
 i am aware that i was also close but you are as well i think you will find that your change was so similar to previous changes that it would count as a revert 
 what do you mean after we discussed it i politely warned you about breaking the N rr and then you attempted to gratuitously wikilawyer your way out of it and continued to revert two more times you even had the gall to through it back in my face and warn me for edit warring i find it nearcomical that you would now call me actions underhanded 
 regards drew ( 
 thanks much appreciated drew ( 
 if you are interested 
 why are you not an admin 
 that is a good question heck i would support you if my support would have any weight 
 thats flattering beyond words to hear this from two peers and excellent editors im not sure i have the temperament or the time and mdash its been weeks since i have been able to write an article just from the upkeep of my watchlist but im honored by your suggestion as corny as i might sound maybe that would the be logical progression with great respect 
 please feel free to use my page for testing 
 i see thank you 
 in the discussion 
 the article really doesnt address the points i brought up is worldcon mounted by a volunteer organization with no salaried employees the article doesnt say does it have sponsorships how does it pay for itself every year the article doesnt say the point about guests of honor being who is available comes from experience in the profession i feel badly that my comments were taken personally are you associated with worldcon 
 worldcons have no employees and are entirely run by volunteers with no salaraied employees if you look at the article you will see that they are notforprofit organizations very different from a commercial comic con or star trek convention 
 yes i have been volunteering at worldcons for the past dozen years although i endeavor to write in a 
 you may have been led astray tenebrae by your professional experience with comics conventions which are much more commercialized and organized under completely different principles worldcons are an entirely different affair operating under an older allvolunteer paradigm 
 and well i think it would be cool if they were put on peoples user pages now instead of like N months after all they hype is over i did put it in 
 hey i will be the first get up and dance if he comes back but from what i have been hearing he is dead and i need to mourn N p 
 in civil war initiative ms marvel says he is alive and hidden 
 i heard about that and well i kept hearing that he is dead like dead dead like ms marvel was wrong 
 yknow i gotta tell ya the way the article is right now seems pretty good states things in a straightforward fashion while taking the particular conventions of comicbook deaths into account im feeling pretty proud of my colleagues and myself at least as i said at this particular moment 
 actually i am suprised about the amount of vandaliosm that has happened to this page i would expect people to be doing reverts every few seconds but it does not seem that bad 
 happy editing and have a great day 
 you are welcome have you had a look at the 
 the issue is decidedly clearcut apodictic and irrefragable learn and return 
 users should be warned for each and every instance of vandalism see more at 
 meh i generally dont warn onetime vandals like 
 sure thing 
 you are most certainly welcome 
 uN 
 uN 
 i didnt realize wp followed its own standard on this sorry about that 
 please refrain from undoing other peoples edits repeatedly if you continue you may be 
 my concern however is still with the earlier issue of the comment and what sort of impression that creates for users im not sure i understand 
 yes my sentence was ungrammatical but its very hard to cite this even if its true in the author used the name how to be happy for the first time but from that time all of his strips are named how to be happy i dont know how exacty can i cite that 
 and proves that these two names are the same comics 
 hi tenebrae wasup just dropping by to make a note about your punisher edit particularly about the punisher issue #N i was browsing the website thepunishercom and it released the comicbook cover for issue #N and it made note about the punishers date of birth printed on the cover i thought this issue would be a collectors item so i grabbed a copy but when i bought the book itself the punishers date of birth was removed from the cover but the site thepunishercom has a scanned copy of thiss book with the punishers dob from marvel itself thats why i made a note in that particular section of the article let me know if its still notable to mention it on the article or you can try to browse thepunishercom website search in the past news then look for the scanned image of issue #N with punishers date of birth thanks and happy wikiying 
 thanks for the quick reply ill try to email the owner of thepunishercom to verify where exactly he took the info or if marvel still has a news or a scanned image about the issue but i also have copied the jpeg of that issue but i know it still needs verification if its just a photomanipulation or if timothy bradstreet really incorporate it in his cover painting but i recall in the past he also made some changes in his painting marvel asked him to remove some blood in his painting but i forgot what cover issue i will come back later to give you the imagethanks 
 but in short i like the style on the university endowment lands and richmond articles personally bodies of water shouldnt be a big deal if it influences the city significantly i think im not sure if you already did but maybe you can post something on the wikiproject vancouver talkpage about this too to get more input uN 
 just did a little experimenting do you think something like 
 hi its me bloodpack and here it is check out the january N N news and look carefully under the punishers dob and i also went to marvels site but issue #N doesnt have an image this one is from punisherartcom site again it has a dob but if you buy the book in the comicbook shop his dob is blacked out 
 thanks laterz ] 
 good point take a look now i have updated the link list at the top of the article 
 hi could you help with moving this article 
 done 
 now hes damaging the 
 oh dear 
 have you ever thought of using 
 cool thanks for doing that i have checked out the page before and had planned to apply to use it no time like the present eh 
 hi i know you are a member of wikiproject a and f and was hoping you might want to help me clean up 
 sorry filmfan im no longer in films and bios 
 uN 
 wow looks good you put a lot of work into it and it shows some problems though one we lose the diagonals which is a fair bit of information two the arrow icons invite people to click on them which leads to the image page this will be somewhat confusing for most readers so you might want to consider using arrows from a character set 
 well i didnt make it i spotted it while leafing through the 
 update well we could do 
 hey forgot to leave you a note re the latest update take a look at your sandbox when you get a chance and let me know what you think 
 yeah so far it looks pretty good i like it im going to start implementing this format to some of the articles slowly to see how it works out uN 
 i dont think crowding would be a problem unless we go nuts like the vancouver article take a peek at 
 omitting some directions kind of makes the navbox look incomplete those blank spots are just a bit glaring just my opinion uN 
 i liken it to the directions assigned to highways a north route doesnt always head exactly north but its the best approximation of which way you will be travelling food for thought so lets keep this discussion going 
 okay well i see your point too lets do it your way and see what happens for the most part it looks alright if any problems arise we will deal with them when they come uN 
 very kind its important to try and get your ideas in there too the part that im least keen on is having multiple entries for the same municipality vancouver vancouver vancouver if we can address that issue i wouldnt be so bothered by having say surrey and delta in the same cell on the subject of the empty spaces what do you think of the idea of using some colourcoding i was thinking that we could colour the backgrounds of the individual cells with a very light green or blue to visually tie the cells together i will be playing around with the coding later tonight (
 well im more or less siding with you here repeating municipalities may be stupid unless its really needed im not sure about the colorcoding idea i will have to look at it several times until i know how i feel about it if that goes ahead i think simply using grayscale colors might be better i mean a navbox with green and red and blue would look weird uN 
 i hate to ask this in this way but at what point does an editors insistence of going back to his last edit constitute 
 that 
 there was a notes section i had put into whizzer and blur that took the jargon out of the lead ph and where asgadian likes it the cite section i really think it should be on all of the squadron articles that deal with that particular element an example of one that doesnt need it would be speed demon 
 wow something of an esoteric introduction i must say but thank you i did indeed enjoy the numismatic listing of presidents and you know i actually had no idea where the template image on my user page came from thats quite nice to know and with your permission i might use that stamp for my page thanks again and if theres anything you need feel free to come by my page and id be glad to help cheers 
 the stamp image is a hi ares scan of a stamp in my collection but because the stamp is a product of the federal gov issued before N any photo image of these stamps are therefore in the public domain anyone can use them if you have a mind for american history you might want to check out various stamp issues of the us post office issued over the last N + years as i explain on my 
 no no i am not well versed in numismatism and its quite interesting anyway i have no idea why there is a lack of stat data on the the stat page however i have found that if you select page history and click the page stats link there it works just fine for me at least cheers 
 yes any time i want to check a pages stats i click view history and then page view statistics today aug N nd ieon the 
 also for the dnv to the northeast of vancouver i had to think twice about it too but after looking at the map i realized that only a small strip of the dnv is actually across from vancouver and most of it lies to its northeast instead if you go across the burrard inlet from vancouver chances are that you will hit cnv rather than dnv that was my reasoning for that uN 
 there might be a problem with the highway sign symbols now that i look closer those pics are fair use i wonder if using them in the municipality box is a violation of the fair use limitations uN 
 i have reported asgardian to the 
 dear tenebrae im sorry i wasnt around when you asked for my help fortunately my friend rogerd saw your request and acted immediately needless to say i was glad to offer you my assistance the other day and if you ever need me again please dont hesitate to ask me and i will come flying if im around that is hugs 
 you really deserve it and besides i could need someone to back me up just in case i run into some trouble anyways i didnt know its your second ill just move the wikiproject title regards 
 actually i also nominated myself for the position to know how it feels like the result was a staggering landslide oppositions d 
 the edit that you reverted in particular is typical the citation that they referenced does not mention the supposed controversy at all the article discusses wikipedia and editwars not the controversy which ed wrote about secondly the controversy itself is nonexistent the opposing candidate has already contacted vaughan council and he received a response which told him in not so many words that councillor shefman was doing nothing wrong and that the contest was perfectly in line with his rights as city councillor i would respectfully request that you remove that content from the page as it is irrellevant unverifiable and blatantly untrue thanks 
 thanks sorry you got dragged into this 
 ya i certainly agree that the vaughan citizen article is worthy of mention it was just the controversies section i meant to remove either way it seems to be fine now 
 just to be clear the vaughan citizen article is not worthy of mention because of you it is important because we learn that alan shefman has instructed his son to do damage control for him on wikipedia 
 ckatz you will notice that 
 so says the man who is working on his fathers campaign you are inheriently pov 
 as you continue to claim yet funnily enough you still seem to be unable to provide any evidence proof or anything besides assertions for that matter and while we are on the topic 
 you openly admit in the article that you have an agenda so how can i assume good faith 
 what is your reasons for reverting the shefman mailing list fiasco 
 i might ask you what your reason is for persisting in this frankly rather pathetic edit war you have already been for ignoring established wiki procedure and it was quite a scolding at that 
 its really a great loss for the comics project if you miss it just give it a try we have nothing to lose and its a fun wiki experience its really meant for you 
 i have faith in you ten im sorry im offline this weekend but ill post it now keep the spirit and best of luck 
 auN cN uN bbuN bN uN cN uN cN uN bN uN bfuN cN uN cN uN cN uN cN uN bfuN bduN bN uN cN uN cN uN bauN bbuN bN uN bfuN cN uN bbuN bN uN cN uN bN uN cN uN bfuN cN uN bN uN bfuN uN cN uN bN uN ba uN cN uN cN uN bN uN bauN cN 
 hehe thats what i was trying for which words are off N N november N 
 also i have fully protected the bob kane article for a week the problem there is not vandalism but a dispute and semiprotection cannot be used for disputes i made the duration a week because if the anon does not engage in discussion after a week he probably never will if the anon continues to be a problem after a week let me know 
 im glad you asked me to take a second look at spider man you were correct and i have semiprotected it indefinitely the reason i came to the wrong conclusion is because i failed to notice that it was previously protected up until a few days ago so i thought the current wave of vandalism was a fluke it seems clear to me now that since the vandalism resumed immediately after the protection lapsed that it should remain semiprotected 
 please refrain from injecting your pov into articles without prior discussion thank you 
 oops appologies mate you did no such thing i must have clicked wrong link 
 the sale of chum is irrelevant to the individual stations the only article it belongs in is perhaps the main 
 i will revert it because of the above 
 the other guy doesnt count hes not registered for all i know hes you 
 good plan 
 in N hours i will be reverting your edits 
 i will agree that who owns you is important but the transaction isnt complete right now its only speculation the 
 the crtc very likely could say no since then there would be only two private broadcasters in canada 
 i didnt vandalize i reverted there is a distinct difference read 
 hey thanks for the help with the copyedit on the patriots article it improved the quality tenfold 
 hey you are welcome the fa nomination is going well right now theres only one object to work on the person who objected wants more businessrelated information to be included in the main article 
 tenebrae im seriously disappointed in your canvassing efforts regarding 
 the rfa was never transcluded to 
 i think you should go for it you are a good editor and frankly we could use you either way pleasure to be working with ya 
 it still has to be transcluded to wprfa personally i think you should wait a month after this canvassing fiasco the field of consensus is polluted i heartily applaud your efforts at retracting the comments etc but consensus not achievable now only voting will be served 
 i respectfully disagree and mdash i think i have a lot to offer if you look at the totality of my wikiepdia work and mdash and i believe the words fiasco and polluted are perhaps more loaded than neutral i fixed my inadvertent guideline mistake so quickly many users will not have seen it particularly those outside the us as i said its important that this come up on the rfa debate and i strongly urge you to add my error to the mix i want to be judged fairly 
 that it was removed does not help the effect on consensus garnering i think it wonderful that you did remove those canvassing attempts it speaks volumes of your ability to take criticism and respond appropriately finding 
 durin has a point waiting a week or so would probably be a good idea or at least a show of good faith 
 i understand id just like this to be over with and mdash and from the early returns it looks like it will be over soon thats actually a relief since i didnt want this and was only acting out of what i felt was obligation 
 my support was removed eh delete that one and give it a clean shot later 
 it was removed because the rfa wasnt live yet 
 heyo thanks for coming to my rescue in the solar system article i dont think this guys about to give up though i do not intend to give an inch hes attempting to undo what i have spent over a year attempting to construct when i first encountered the solar system article it was just a random list of objects by class with no notion of where they were or how they functioned in the system i did a massive N day edit to reorder the objects according to region and that is how this article must stay im scared i might get banned if i revert too many of his reversions i dont really know where to go with this 
 re the the section headers i got rid of them because i was getting a bit fed up with having to hold the same conversation twice in two different sections i would post a response in one thread then have to go and answer another thread which often would mean repeating myself it seemed more sane to have only one thread to follow 
 hi can you tell me why its necessary for the article on the greek goddess to be disambiguated when 
 no a separate dab page can be made into a soft redirect which i had done 
 as a seasoned member of the comics project im hoping you can help i was trying to update the article for 
 that sounds like a good suggestion if the characters had a bit more background it might make sense to split but they are both pretty minor characters thanks for your help 
 im afraid your request for adminship failed you should try again in a few months sorry 
 if this was an online chat i might type i hope you get what i mean 
 ceres is still considered an asteroid by the iau as well as being a dwarf planet you may consult the minor planet centers database for confirmation of this i think you have misinterpreted the statements on the iau website they do not say that ceres is no longer considered an asteroid 
 re please hold off on reverting the asteroids before you read the reference i read the references and checked the mpc listings ceres is still listed as an asteroid as well as a dwarf planet please leave the asteroid articles you modified untouched for the moment 
 the only text here that would imply that ceres is no longer called an asteroid is however when i check the database it is still listed as an asteroid there does seem to be a double standard here there is a very important reason to classify ceres first as an asteroid and second as a dwarf planet however from a scientific perspective that ceres is close to hydrostatic equilibrium is arbitrary it is close to hydrostatisticy but so are many smaller objects and we could always redefine dwarf planet to require a different approximation to equilibrium calling it an asteroid is meaningful because that describes the evolutionary process that the object has been through similarly pluto and eris should first be called plutino and scattered disc object and then be called dwarf planets i dislike meaningless terminology if you want to hold a forum on this be my guest but you should probably have done that before making the edits 
 re naming conventions you are correct that wikipedia should not dictate terminology i am perhaps biased in this respect being both human and a planetary scientist that said i can confidently say that few scientists will call ceres a dwarf planet i have described the mpcs double standard again i suggest that you make sure that there is consensus before you start shifting terminology around i wont be spending any more time on this 
 thanks for your very knowledgeable edits to 
 i second that 
 you know if most of those of us voting for option N just moved our votes to option N then perhaps we would have consensus and just end this unhealthy debate once and for all 
 im sorry but i have no idea which index you are referring to you are editing from what must be a changing ip address so i cant trace your edit history to establish where we crossed paths however if you could please provide some more details i would be happy to discuss it further 
 i will check them out thanks 
 your attention and input is needed 
 i have already reverted all the pages 
 lets discuss this with him because a giant page wont really work when they all are created someday 
 how is it extremist and mudslinging to use a standard afd notification template all i have done here is notify potentially relevant parties that major changes were made to mulitple pages 
 hello 
 im here im just doing other things that arent improving the wiki i consider these unconstructive and bordering on vandalism could be considered the start of some bad stuff but im willing to look past that as i initially went in there with guns blazing 
 i really think you should reconsider your keep vote for having both the group state chapter page and indiv pages even with only a brief section for each chapter a grouppage would quickly balloon beyond a reasonably sized single article 
 i have seen it done safely before personally im willing to see if it will work before i make any judgements besides in a compromise each side has to give a bit for the greater good 
 i would like to know where you have seen this before as for compromise i didnt start this 
 i dont really remember an exact example as i have edited over N pages by now im just saying that rey will likely come in and have a good reason for doing whatever he did i dont support what he did but he also might have a reason that is pretty darn good i know that some editors will saunter by and advocate for deleting everything there so if we can get the support of an editor it will be helpful for the both of us he didnt vandalize in fact he was probably 
 looking over things now i have a good idea how about we team up and fix up all of these articles starting with the ohio page as you seem to be very knowledgable in this subject im actually highly impressed by how this page looks in addition if we go about creating maybe N articles apiece we have covered almost all of the pages and we could get a better idea about how this proposal of mine for a directory page would look its just an idea but why not try it 
 when you are done with a discussion or anything else thats been on the notice board please remember to move it down to the arecent decisions section instead of just deleting it 
 i caught one of yours this morning its no big i think we started doing it this way so we could see if an issue had recently come up or not 
 great line at talktpm duh stories dont usually have news articles written about them while huh stories usually do your recent post there and the earlier exchange with lucymarie make me wonder why we got off on the wrong foot at the restoring honor rally re crowd size anyway i thought you might also like to weigh in at the splc page where a couple of povwarriors are wearing down the regulars there regards 
 not to interfere with the hugfest but i should probably mention that both 
 i honestly have no idea about that user or his issue with adding the site the site has a lot of users and people have added links to the galleries on other artists wikipedia pages before it was never an issue before so he probably didnt do it with the intention to defy the rules and policies but then i dont know him so he might have i have nothing to do with any of that however 
 kidding aside you might want to mention this to 
 i have created 
 i agree 
 unless im mistaken i dont have mindreader accross my head please check things out before you presume they are fancruft and delete so if youd care to explain what i am supposed to check 
 this refers to the 
 its not my job to go trawling the internet for cites that people dont add your welcome to find one and add them to the article but if its uncited i am well within rights to remove it till it can be adequatly cited 
 well i never said you didnt have the right to do it i merely asked if you could be a bit more polite about the way you go about doing it if you wish to think of this as a job then you might also want to consider that labelling your edit with uncited and liekly fan cruft so exterminate isnt particularly professional the possibility of a film involving the bsg universe is a noteworthy addition to an article about bsg so you could easily have added a citation tag and waited a few days to see if anyone responded 
 professional i dont get paid to edit wikipedia imo it is better to have an article with N per cent uncited info ratehr then an article with a ton of s had i had the time to trawl the web for a citation i likely would of i did not however 
 i havent made abusive comments ive stated facts im sorry that youve been offended but if you didnt want to be accused then dont do it youre the only one who has made bad comments i have tried to remain civil 
 you are stating your personal opinion not facts 
 thank you very much but it was discussed in june we dont know if the nccN is the next ship for all we know there could of been a shuttle named enterprise that had never been mentioned 
 matthew it wasnt exactly discussed you said removed the ship table as we dont know much about the xcv and also the starfleets are diffrent so dont add it back thank you and deleted it also it doesnt matter if another ship named enterprise turns up someday we have to act based on what we know now the template is for moving between articles about ships named enterprise not for establishing an absolute record of said ships 
 as a matter of fact 
 i have responded to this occasionally capletter tirade on the users talk page anyone interested can also see some of the selectively deleted postings 
 i saw and i know thanks or 
 i move them if i do not like them during an edit you are welcome to show me guideline that says i can not move them thanks or 
 its part of the 
 and if you would go to the archive there are almost all the comments except youre mots troll ones which i refuse to keep youre wrong this time guy let it go 
 note an admin blocked 
 my mission is done batman and robin has a plot i hope you dont let your personal feelings keep you from working with me in the future 
 if you hadnt erased so many postings and mdash which is ineffective in any case since they are available via your history page and mdash you would be taken as a more responsible wikipedian 
 please go to 
 calling someones post snotty is probably not a good way to cooldown a dispute may i suggest you cross out that word as a show of goodfaith 
 note an admin blocked 
 uh i was just look at switchfoN tN s talk page how did that user find out that their talk page was in your watchlist im not try to spy on other users watchlists but i didnt think that anyone could see them im just asking thats all 
 based on activity i guess i monitor several hundred different articles that i have worked on for changes and vandalism as well as doing the odd bit of vandal patrol work when an editors actions warrant it i will leave a warning on their talk page and the wiki software automatically adds that talk page to my watchlist after allowing time for them to reply i remove the page however if theres an apparent pattern i will keep an eye out for a while which led to a note on sws page today hence the question as far as i know the wiki software wont allow you to check out other watchlists for privacy reasons hope this helps 
 hmm it doesnt render below the image on some browsers hold on thanks or 
 try now should work thanks or 
 anyway yea i watch heroes sliders star trek the N bsg jericho veronica mars the oc medium odyssey N lost dead like me desperate housewives greys anatomy and odd shows n stuff etcetera hehe thanks or 
 i watch doctor who yea torchwood has been good never seen blakes N there isnt much in the way of scifi over here though i watch red dwarf there is or was a new scificomedy thing called hyperdrive sucks major time though i watch the odd soap as well hehe thanks or 
 you got me there id just assumed it was him and i think it is but alas 
 thank you 
 i think i have addressed some of all of your issues and hopefully some of the peer review suggestions would you mind if i cleanup the talk page of the article id like to nominate it for a good article review and dont want the old discussion to distract i can archive it or just clean it up 
 based on the wikipedia articles about the 
 tenebraei readded msnsportsnetcom to the wvu page contrary to what you saidit is the official website for wvu athletics that is maintained by the univeristy thanks for fixing the misspelling in governors though 
 i also noticed your edits fixing the referencesonce again good job looks much better now 
 wayward i notice you recieved a barnstar for removal of the squid vandal congratulations and thanks for the great work but is that a reference to the 
 and hes been destroyed or stopped good also good because now i can verify if hes the george reeves guy but how is someone like squidward stopped so easily 
 hey ckatz check out the new british columbia since the N s not bad eh with regards to french i really resent having french rammed down my throat but im used to it so i wont revert it anymore not because i agree with presenting it in french but because simply i hate fighting the french as it were if i surrender they usually shut up sorry to sound cynical but then what selfrespecting british columbian isnt at least a little bit cynical 
 sorry you feel that way about bilingualism perhaps it might help if you didnt view it as us versus them frankly i think it makes the country that much more interesting 
 mike your links are to a commercial site that is contrary to wikipedias 
 stop deleting large chunks of the article or i will report you to wikipedia admin and request blocking 
 please do not make in an attempt to justify your at 
 if i can help you with links or information about wikipedia consensusbuilding and basic guidelines i will take the time to do so in the meantime please do not 
 if you will not even allow me to accomplish this one miniscule task then i would suggest that some parts of your rules are inherently flawed and i would sadly take this experience as the best incentive to not become a productive member of your society 
 dear orderinchaosthats grandiaN againuser is repeatedly vandalizing 
 againdear orderinchaosanother vandalism happened right the next day by another unregistered userplease see thankfully user delldot reverted to the last version by mewould you care to show some attention and at least lock the page so that registered users can only edit itthanks again 
 dont worry about it orderinchaossorry to say thisbut i was able to find an admin who was actually awake as to help me 
 yes there are people who have a variety of obscure theories that would require justification and some producers may want to disguise their references lest they face a lawsuit but a spoof is protected the references will add to a readers education and let them enjoy the episodes once they see them several times 
 hi im sorry but thats not how wikipedia works please read the second paragraph in 
 im swamped in real life right now so i didnt quickly respond to asgarians message on my talk page which he probably should not have left at a time when it could be construed as evading a block taking a few days without editing on wikipedia is refreshing its useful to step back for perspective on how absolutely nothing that affects planet earth will go wrong if i dont edit some articles and if i stay out of the current chapter in what is now a tenmonth dispute over editing style yeah it would have been best if he had not mentioned a solicitor but my feeling on that is like the advice i gave him let it roll off like water off a duck remember it but dont poke that bear ourselves by bringing it up this is a weird weird situation and everybody needs to be careful to use language aimed at demonstrating their attempts at objectivity should an admin unfamiliar with the situation eventually arbitrate things anyway thanks for dropping by my talk page yours 
 i put that on your user page oops sorry about that 
 i needed a template to work around 
 no problem at all just had to ensure that some of the templates didnt persist such as the vandalproof software tag etc enjoy 
 thanks 
 regarding your request to move 
 ps i noticed that uN cthe mockeruN d is used four times on the article page and #N 
 hi and thanks for getting back to me while the character is referred to as the mocker other characters such as the joker the flash and the avengers appear as 
 you make a good point about the other articles and keeping consistency however i would have used the in most of your cited articles i took at a look at 
 i guess starting with 
 hi there thats true you know a stateless person has indeed filed claim to that unclaimed hunk of antarctica anyways you seem like a nice editorand no surprise as vancouver is greatand i have mixed feelings about wikipedia its really wonderful of courseso much excellent infoyet as i scan the last few of ur edits i see that many times people like you are getting ur time wastedits such a strange concept that whoever wants can put up what info they want and then it gets subject to constant editingits so strange that an encyclopedia needs patrolling editorsand that most pages are constantly changing and going back and forth between different peoples versions and takes on thingsits an information warfare site to a certain extentit really makes u think about the nature of informationyet at least its not so bad on many types of pages such as some hard science pagesyet even here things are in dispute and subject to various prejudicesanyways thats great u keep adding astonomy stuffkeep up the good work and i guess its best if u keep rolling thru new things so whenever u are editing stuff out u are reading new things so its not such a waste of ur timethere are some great and interesting new things this type of format gives usyet some peculiar problems it creates as wellso merci viel mal as we would say in switzerland thank you when i have time ill look up all the monty python named asteroidsive been getting into more astrobiology these days and terraforming and colonizing venus and the likeanything u put up regarding this subject gets cheers from me u might end up an important protospace colonistbon jour benji 
 thanks for the note as for the antarctic claim theres no mention of it at the or the websites no results for a google search or on some other antartica pages i looked at wikipedia requires solid references for text and in the absence of that we have no choice but to remove the text about the supposed stateless person territorial claim 
 ok how did you get your awards just well trying to set some sort of goal for myself so i dont well get lost in all the wikipolitics and quit 
 notethis is not me asking for one 
 i am beginning to pay attention to the copyright problems page and i noticed you edit there i want to point out that the corensearchbot seems to have a false positive with 
 hi if you find a false positive at 
 i dont think you can devalue them seeing as how there really is no value to them i think they are just used to show that people are doing good work and you know keep it up kinda like if someone just kept editing and editing but got no recognition they might ask what is the point of this and quito and about the nudge no problem 
 addition 
 id like to know why you removed my comments from the talk page of 
 your comments involved adding one word to a discussion prior to that another editor had to revert you at 
 considering it has already been deleted its no longer an issue but id like it if any future comments would not be removed 
 its not a question of your intent its whether it is appropriate for a discussion on an articles talk page in this case it wasnt and so it was removed to be honest if i hadnt done it someone else would have possibly going a step farther and adding a warning note 
 hmm you are right that does need a tweak the coding is a little different than what im used to so i will try to read up on it and see if it can be adjusted nice job once again for reformatting and creating the new look 
 speechless you have reverted the article again you are placing the exemplars above the manual of style and you dont seem to be working out what is best for the article in question we have a policy which states we can ignore rules to the betterment of the encyclopedia and in my opinion my version better suits the official guidelines and policies than the version you are reverting to the exemplars were written a long time ago by a handful of users myself included and are being badly misinterpreted at any rate they dont dictate that an articles publication history consist of a list of the comics a character has appeared in the goal at wikipedia is to write an encyclopedic treatment of a given subject thats all im really interested in doing im not interested in discussing bright clear lines and what this or that article merits im only interested in seeing all article eventually improve to featured article status and comply as best as possible with the manual of style the new manual of style on writing about fiction supercedes the exemplars which were never intended to be slavishly followed but i am after all only one editor i refuse to edit war and i will allow the wiki process to work as it does for me wikipedia is not a project where one edits each article so that they comply with some dictat for me its about improving each article according to its needs i think blindly enforcing standards is just another form of 
 im not angry as to the rights and wrongs of ignoring guidance 
 my point is that being an admin makes absolutely no difference when it comes to content disputes in which i am involved i was made an admin back in the days when it was deemed no big deal and all it meant was that the community trusted you to do the right thing i hold firm to that and i believe part of that is not using the fact that i am an admin to mean anything when i am in a dispute which does not concern the admin tools since this instance does not concern the admin tools i am not acting as an admin but am just another user 
 do not add offtopic information please find the appropriate article such as 
 ummm i think that you are looking at two sentences if youd like to critique by all means go ahead but i want to doublecheck to see if you have misread this particular example 
 looks great to me 
 id like to begin so have a look at 
 i initiated a discussion at 
 i understand and accept what you are saying but i dont accept duhons pretense that he was rv vandalism when he deleted my post i dont expect you to agree with my position on the issues regarding this case but i do know you are an experienced and levelheaded wikipedian and thats why i spotted what you spotted i might have missed it and i think langara college deliberately ignored it paranoia i dunno given lcs comments about not liking vandalism so much its amazing to me that they or he or she didnt look at the rv vandalism to see what it was and realize that it was a bunk edit comment with an attack delete silencing me is not a nice thing to do and im a scorpio with planets in all the wrong places given that its duhon and langara college that want the cfm but both of their behaviours have been questionable and now this brodey characters come along to redefine what the article is supposed to be about ie what hollywood north is supposed to mean rather than what it is as i said this reminds me of the expansion of the hongcouver article into a general thing on the asiafication of vancouver which should be a different article same thing here tv production in canada 
 believe me id rather be fussing with my mountain and history and bio and ship and first nations articles than having to fuss with this but once i know somethings been put wrong i have to see it put right its another part of that scorpio thing we dont sacrifice truth easily and we dont compromise well even when wed like to this ones partly near and dear to me because i know a lot of people in the industry in various capacities and also back in N worked on a startup rag that didnt go anywhere called rolecall which lasted maybe two issues before somebodys er nasal congestion problem got the better of his budget and bankrupted his backe or gfriend the hollywood north thing was new then and some were caught up with stars in their eyes or more regarding it as a gold rush but for the industry it was an expression of a growing reality the tranplantation of productions to vancovuer through outsourcing wed been a centre of tv and radio advertising spots since the early N s and still are expanding into feature film and tv series was the new thing but it was a business thing not a glamourandglitz and arent we great campaign like to is engaging in and we dont go looking for cool catchphrases to coopt from other cities to promote our own city with people from vancouver in order to become stars have to go somewhere else to be able to be seen as one here not so with people from toronto or la 
 hi ckatz in reverting my recent edit of 
 hello no problem replying here as for the return to is its based on parts of the style guide examples of other articles and related discussions i will give you what links i can off the top of my head and try to add to the list as i find more examples generally speaking writing about fiction is to be done in what the mos calls the 
 i dont mean to be argumentative about this if the wikipedia community reaches a consensus that is should replace was in this context i will comply but i dont think this has happened and my unscientific survey of the way wikipedia articles are currently written leads me to believe that the consensus favors was 
 read the book first he bring back asgard then the cops come and then the owner of the land comes he tells thor he must purchase the land which thor does with the wealth of asgard dont ever remove factual information please 
 hes clearly beyond the pale of wikiquette farther than nearly anything i have seen what with this afd thing and the claim that you and mkdw blanked the talkpage and so on see my latest on 
 was that a camouflage sectiontitle on my talkpage or what or did you accidentally copypaste something into the subject line as for the situation its too clear that these are attack edits and hostile to the existence of the concept never mind the article i was hostile to the way the hongcouver article got bloated and i do have my reservations about the varying interpretation treatment of the notion of hollywood north but since its come into use to mean the industry by way of volume and even torontos particular taste in using it its a different situation than hongcouver where the term was used to write something that was a vancouver variation of the chinese immigration to canada article in hollywood norths case whether yellowsnow likes it or not it is a term thats in wide usage even if not the american entertainment industry whatever i dont think a mediation is whats needed here i think yellowsnow is far out of line with his behaviour not just on the talkpage but also with his hostile edits to the page overall and over a period of time myself i think he should be blocked 
 obviously entertainment tonight is referring very much tongueincheek to sundance as hollywood north sundance as you may not know is located in the united states again use of a protologism especially by a flippant fluffy show does not mean that there is an actual place called hollywood north and it doesnt have any context to the canadian film industry in this example whatsoever you might as well be arguing about santas village at the north pole hollywood north simply doesnt exist you guys cant even agree on what it means which is proof that it doesnt support wikipedias inclusion criteria and when you just blatantly erase my changes you are not being neutral as you have tried to claim to be btw 
 if you review the edit history at both 
 and once again i would ask that you avoid making misleading accusations about anyone who disagrees with you in this case your messages imply that i have threatened to have you banned or that i have put graffiti and threats on your talk page and several other comments i have done no such thing and any examination of the history of our interactions will reveal just that please be civil at least 
 and just to note theres a big difference between warning someone about the probability of a block if their uncivil behaviour and antiencyclopedic edits continue and threatening to have someone banned theres also a big difference between a disciplinary block and a ban which is much more severe but such misrepresentations are stockintrade from deys and its rather cute of him to complain about someone vandalizing his webpage given his own verymany vandalisms of both the hn article and its talkpage 
 twenty of your friends is more like twenty million of your friends but again untrue hyperbole is something of a trademark of dyes style even a google search turns up usages on americanbased websites but even if it didnt the fact is that the term is common in canadian english and canadian culture whether dyes likes it or not as such its of encyclopedic interest whether or not if offends hollywood loyalists period 
 i noticed you ac candidate review page you seemed to interpret not wanting to research something for minimal use with not wanting to research anything you also said that one of the answers was confusing yes the complexity was the point i was showing that the matter of deciding rfa policy what clearly out of the bounds of arbcom as drifts into open ended legislating and that the role of bcrats has not been well defined while ac can decide on abuses ideally effectively it will have a hard time as the role was never made clear by consensus and ac cant just figure out the rules to get consensus either as it drifts into that same complexity as before what would help is a community discussion on achieving consensus id give you a simple answer if there was one as for mispelling a word while i hammered out all these replies i dont really know what to say about that 
 ouch you must learn to love your brother irrespective of his spelling prowess 
 as for mispelling i was wondering how you would react to that that seems a tad too superficial imo i cant see why that would matter too much i suppose i could download the firefox toolbar the main reason that i am running for ac is to give more options to voters and because its a task that i feel i could handle in fact if N more candidates came up that i would support myself then id drop out i dont think i am being disrespectful to anyone and your questions are not any less harsh than my harshist replies 
 thank you i understand but reserve the right to disagree not about misspelling of course that is certainly minor 
 i didnt take a tone with anybody i gave him a proper warning just like i would give anyone who vandalised a page 
 butit was not vandalism 
 yes it was you removed factual information 
 and how per say did he know it was factual see you got to see it from his point of view you added info but you added it with out a reference so he had no idea if that was what actually happened or not so to him you were the vandal next time just add a reference and you should be good 
 its called good faith he vandalised the page i properly warned him end of story its done and over with anyway 
 point of fact i have not ever vandalized a page anyone interested in 
 thoughts 
 hi brianN although mad jack suggested that you post this case on 
 merry christmas is fine by me and a merry expired christmas to you more than likely the user simply went to another computer as this was a single edit not ongoing further action isnt necessary at this time but if there are any more persistent edits of this fashion a block may be in order cheers 
 while d w griffith is perhaps the most important and notable early film maker of alltime the word legendary pertains of legend you will find that almost no encyclopedia will refer to a person as legendary unless specific context such as 
 i swapped in notable but it didnt read quite right in this context so i have removed it altogether what do you think of pioneering 
 i made a change to the sentence but im not sure if it works what do you think 
 thanks for the kind words concerning my edits i dont know that i can provide much in the way of advice but will certainly pass on anything that comes to mind 
 i see that you have placed unsourced tags on articles some quite old and inactive which i state on my user page that i created i know it wasnt your intent but under certain circumstances that would be considered wikistalking not your intent im sure but something to keep in mind for the future see 
 i already put a note on your talk page when i did this not being hostile i often browse user pages and look at created content to see common errors this is certainly allowed and miles from wikistalking or anything in 
 i realize that i was just making a gentle point to you as a new editor that what you did can be easily misconstrued when your acquaintanceship with the other editor stems from an editing disagreement that is true for both valid and invalid tags theres a lot of precedent for that but i wont bore you with the details 
 on a separate note i guess also regarding political correctness how do you feel about my statement regarding questionable notability on your talk page i feel this can be disparaging without much research to substantiate it in general i feel if an article is well written and informative im certainly not going to look into notability of the subject which would frankly be a misuse of my time editing if i am unwilling to get into a deeper notability discussion should i leave out comments as such 
 theres nothing wrong with questioning the notability of a subject of an article i do it all the time but i dont think it is an issue with the three articles you tagged richard price is an eminent writer and screenwriter and malcolm johnson is a famous investigative reporter whose articles won a pulitzer and were the basis of the movie on the waterfront now willemse is admittedly more obscure but he wrote two significant books on new york city police history one of which was adapted into a motion picture 
 yeah i thought it was an interesting link too which is why when i found it at 
 and re the idea of a 
 again check the shows page at cbscom that is the list of characters N in total not including any of the ones you added the fact that you created an article about a character on a tv show does not make him or her a main character it just means that there is an article you can still link to your article from the entry in the minor characters section 
 once again it does not matter if you or i or a tv reviewer or anyone else thinks a particular role is important the shows producers and the network decide who the stars are and who gets promoted as such in conjunction with union agreements the jericho wiki is not the same as the official site and even if it was the deputies are listed under supporting characters i could write an article about the guy who died from radiation poisoning but it still wouldnt make him a main character im going to restore the list to what it should be based on the official cbs website as your own examples prove that the changes you have made do not reflect the actual character list please take your concerns to the article talk page if you wish to seek a change rather than just changing the article over and over again thanks 
 i think you have identified a legitimate ambiguity as to the date on which justice gray left the court and justice holmes arrived the federal judicial center site indeed reports holmes receiving a recess appointment on august N N although gray whom he succeeded did not die until september N i believe i have an explanation of what actually happened but want to verify it in one or more of my reference books at the office before correcting the article regards 
 i thank you sir 
 if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the 
 thanks for adding that rationale since that image is in two different articles the rationale needs to explain why it needs to be used in each of the two articles i added an explanation for the articles the image is in but you may want to look at what i wrote and tweak it some the stronger the rationale the less likely someone else will challenge it and mdash and nbspcarl ( 
 if you have a dispute over the awards table please take it up with 
 just for the record i am not the publisher nor have i ever claimed to be one furthermore i am not affiliated with the publisher in any shape or form quite frankly im surprised tanebrae ever assumed that 
 wow you are fast N seconds between vandals change and your revert someday i will have to get that powerful revert tool 
 he or she seems to have given up for a while 
 you deprodded the article because there is a book about him published by a major architectural press i note that the book is listed under references but is in fact not referenced in the article can you help address that thank you 
 thank you from your summary i was hoping you had access to the book 
 please feel free it sounds like you know the history very well and merry christmas 
 i thank you sir happy christmas 
 as others have noted on this page wikipedia disallows links to other wikis such as the marvel database project please see the guidelines at 
 i completely agree if you will notice they arent using the wiki as a source they are saying if you are interested in more info than the godawful notability policy lets us post go here even on official policy pages they mention that you should throw up a link to an external fanwiki im going to readd the link on because its in my watchlist the hobgoblin page and i will take it to an admin if i have to 
 right here also note that 
 because its not against effing policy to have them as links and i dont care who originally put them there at any rate i have raised the question here 
 apologies i have gotten to the point where i dont consider that language especially as i was using it a substitute for a word i would consider uncivil for what its worth use any language you like on mine 
 well eris does not have miles although pluto does the asteroids do not have miles either and while i understand your desire for consistency if it is right to include the us or imperial units at all then it is better to be inconsistent and hope for the later addition to other articles and sections than to remove any additions in things we should be striving for on wikipedia consistency should always come behind correctness uN and nbsp 
 i see that 
 furthermore 
 hi i would to make use of your copyediting services for the 
 sure im a huge fan of bloc party though so im biased best 
 im sure itd be fine if you reviewed its mostly about the prose issues you dont have to support if you think its unethical 
 haha phew as for the cat i think i might have taken it out a loooooong time ago by mistake 
 hey do you mind if i change the ing verbing back they are not big fans of it at fac 
 yep in both previous facs they have become really anal this year 
 could be but i prefer to be on the safe side as they keep picking and picking and picking at minute things 
 a sense of humour wouldnt kill some of them though p 
 oops the present to past tense was needed good spot 
 that is definitely a flaw of mine every time i aim to do it i always go into an editing trance and forget 
 thank you 
 gladly i appreciate it 
 im actually interested in seeing if after we get the article down to about N k if we cant go through a good article review hes a famous top tier dc character despite his spotty publication history and well recognized he doesnt need to have an fa but ought to be a ga 
 nah its all good by the way the dc tempalte i asked for review of went live a few days ago and amazingly its quite stable (although 
 hi ckatz would you take a moment to explain on the 
 if you are referring to i believe that you may have misread the edit history as my comment rm trivia states i only removed some trivia about a mention of bsg on the office this is in keeping with 
 hi ckatz you are completely right i mistook the edit history sorry about the mindlapse 
 no problem at all while i find the undo feature to be very useful especially for removing entrenched vandalism the default comment can be a bit hard to decipher with all the text about who is being undone the what tends to get lost 
 good last edit i was trying to find a previous version that made sense but you found a better one careful on labeling edits dualing fan your edits could be labeled similarly lastly it was a good point you made about black bolt etc the general reader does not know who the other characters are simply by reading the article but they should be able to link back the their respective entries to get further reference however i think your changes are still good ones 
 dont make another revert on the article otherwise you could end up blocked for violating N rr as well i still have one left i will revert when hes blocked 
 true 
 i apologise sir i thank you for explaining 
 cool 
 a discussion regarding your recent conduct has been started here thanks and happy editing 
 an admin has requested that you comment on the 
 hi you have removed lots of els based on 
 i was about to point out the same thing as el they are acceptable i think the debate worth having is whether or not we need two dc wikis linked as we are not the place for those site to compete one seems to be only the timm or dini animated dc so there the question is does the article linked matter if its a stub there and they are just dropping els to get traffic then it can go for example twofaces page theres substantial its unsourced but that wiki may have different standards 
 actually 
 a wiki is not acceptable as a reference but an external link is not necessarily a reference we use external links all the time as further reading on sites which may be more topical have different pov policies or host media not allowed under our free content policy the external link policy is intended to prevent certain types of abuse and the inclusion of links which do not add to the article the relevant line in this case is links to open wikis except those with a substantial history of stability and a substantial number of editors is the dcau wiki substantial you can check its 
 i dont see him saying that i see him saying hes not sure this one adds to all the pages its being linked to any character seen anywhere even those never named but determined by what would be a synth vio are included that can be seen as a sign of instability and excessive crufting i wonder how many of those N articles would completely fail notability or be redirects here for that matter how many of that N k count are redirects there further theres the question of redundancy theres a dc universe wiki as well does wikipedia really need to become a directory of links to each of the half dozen or more comics or cartoon wikis going on i think not i think that one link to the dc universe wiki is enough in fact i think the entire projects should merge but i know that cant happen its not notable nor extended reading to find an unsourced stub full of guesswork i dont think we need them here 
 more then likely will be a march or early april air date new earth was midapril last year rose was early march so i dont think it will be later thanks or 
 or me thinks torchwood is brilliant and wished it was returning sooner apparently the doctor who magazine slates it for jan N (
 i reverted the articles to before replacing the already existing links with the template while you removed links posted with 
 no one is discussing whether those links are inappropriate or not the discussion revolves around a template the links you removed where there before the template 
 you are contradicting yourself right you removed one 
 okay no problem have a nice day or night 
 yeah i feel that flags are pointless redundant and in many cases spacehogging i will admiti liked them at first but i have since grown to dislike them with a passion p 
 add onalso i agree with you N per cent 
 what was the meaning of this you can clearly see that a number of unsourced additions had been which had to be removed alongwith the unreliable links like ladygagashop as well and returning information to 
 you also delinked teddy riley a well known producer and changed april to april amongst other questionable changes the lead you wrote is over twice as long as the original one and includes wishywashy phrases such as songs on this ep deals with a seamier side of 
 again im asking you where you are seeing such as you say everything you say was restored back also 
 im confused as to what you are asking its as plain as day from that diff what changes were made the effect of my reversion was to relink teddy riley to recapitalise the month of april per 
 i hope that i dont need to reiterate that a lead will be a summary of the whole article as per 
 if you do that would put you at risk of N rr just letting you know also cant see anywhere in that diff where singles were added by my reversion the only change that could be debatable is the date of N november but that should be sorted out on the talk page 
 seems ok to me for what its worth 
 i have restored a lot of the reference details that were removed by matheodj as well as fixing some other changes from the same edits id appreciate it if you could please look over the article to make sure that the information you added is still present thanks 
 it was actually italics you removed yea needs a better title i restored the leadin as it just seemed to stern to me ie it didnt flow 
 im just hoping we get a new ship in this new series 
 theres actually four stargate series sgN infinity sga and now sgu sginf was only produced by mgm see 
 its because italics are hard coded into the infobox 
 create a miniproject to bring the articles of 
 one request the gnome could we please continue this on either your or my talk page we have cluttered fxeN s page enough and we have even strayed from the original issue regards 
 one last request xenophrenic could you please explain on what basis exactly you would think im not dispassionate enough to contribute to this particular article when i said i inted to stay away from editing it i was clearly pointing out my previous involvement in it which again involved the duo of you and 
 hopefully that more clearly explains why i feel the article would be better served by more dispassionate lessinvested editors preconceived conclusions about the article subject conspiracy theories about cabals and the combative nature of focusing on editors instead of article improvement are unproductive maliks very first sentence in his response to the latest round of content issues states i dont feel strongly about including it one way or the other but its got to have solid sources i feel the same way do you have any interest in helping to achieve that goal regards 
 well i have had quite a few discussions with other wiki editors through the few years im here and not all of them were quiet affairs but i have to concede first prize to you for sarcasm even when you seem to be denying the existence of sarcasm in your texts you cannot help being sarcastic case in point what you wrote above you appear to have misread yet again here is what i said i will indeed continue to work on snarkiness i anticipate having it honed to a fine art eventually glad i could clear that up for you really well go ahead and carry on hone that snarkiness to a fine art i happen to consider snarkiness extremely counterproductive in a collaborative effort such as wikipedia editing therefore the rest of your text is rendered meaningless it is quite clear that you are not in wikipedia to contribute and or or collaborate in a honest and straightforwad manner (eg you 
 if you dont want my responses to you then do not address me simple enough also i dont sail looks like fun though regards 
 i was serious by the way when i asked if you had any interest in helping with the proper sourcing of content in the steffans article i know you have indicated that you are on the sidelines but your input as one of the proponents of the content at issue would be valuable regards 
 no problem thank you and mdash 
 they are actually links to unofficial advertisingsupported blog site which do not meet 
 hi neil if you have a second we could really use your help if you go to 
 as best i can tell tenebrae this dispute is over a few minor edits from david a he seems willing to compromise i note his last edit did not have the parts you were particularly against are you equally willing given i dont know much about any marvel comics other than the awesome 
 oh is it really standard practise to delete contributions by banned users it just doesnt make sense but anyway if it cant stay there can you retrieve it for me so i could place it in my userspace 
 restored for you 
 forever or should i just copy the code and create a new page for it 
 use the move feature at the top of the page to move the page to a new title that way you can keep the page history if you like if not just copy the text out 
 okay thanks 
 you are welcome 
 hi there i note you reverted an edit to this page and warned 
 whoops thanks for catching that its been really hard to keep track over the past while i have made the change cheers 
 no worries thanks for making the change i actually asked for semiprotection as there appeared to be a lot of anon ip edits hopfully this will give the breathing space needed cheers 
 chris i just wanted to give you a heads up that theres been some aggressive trimming of the protein wisdom article someone came in and took out some of the old material but i had the impression that they were a little overaggressive i attempted to add in a few details and got reverted since then i have added some moremore currentmaterial along with lavish citations or sources but im hoping that the hyperaggressive prunerofentries will be happy and not revert all my recent changes im wondering if you might be able to add the pw entry to your watch list and back me up if someone tries to gut it again 
 imo the anon is a covert povpusher trying to use wikipedia to damage a conservatives reputation a popular pastime these days i expect he already has an account here sigh 
 thanks hes back now btw i will poke around there for a little while and then leave it to you 
 do you think these should possibly be merged 
 interesting idea i would support it in that they are about the same topic i would oppose it because one will happen regardless as a stub with an infobox and a template will create a large whitespace while the whole image thing can happen on any page im actually stumped on what to do i think we could try to keep them apart and see what others think but that is my opinion 
 they can also be told in slightly different ways help namespace is supposed to give technical instructions like i wrote essays are supposed to give personal points of view and in some cases are humorous this is where you can vary 
 first thanks ofr the support second i have begun slowly to rewrite the hulk article in my sandbox heres a link please take a look
 once again and as its more important in light of david as recent diatribe please review and leave comments on my talk thanks 
 sounds good might help its the version i cut n pasted to work from and where i am now i still have personality sections to incorporate but im closing in all the old stuff is after my refs list i used that to differentiate 
 any luck with some time to review that hulk rewrite you are busy making more work for me there citingg all the popculture id like to get the other thing moving so i can move forwards thanks man 
 as always your opinion is valued and i see some of the logic in streamlining i was trying to avoid being too aresearch paperish in my writing because if you think my talk page arguments are verbose you should have seen my postgrad writings i will strip it down more but im not dropping a single citation because i think its one of the things that can get the article to a or ga eventually as for your examples im going to incorporate a bunch of your stuff verbatim if i may 
 i responded at my sandbox about some of your assessments and a defense of the citation heavy paragraph thanks for listening and please keep commenting i do need it 
 thats the newest version its got all the info all the cites more active voice less verbosity and i reread it for clarity i think it reads far smoother and more encyclopedically than the current version please give me feedback if only a pat on the back 
 i have placed a link in the hulk talk tomorrow night i expect to put it up unless theres major objection 
 i think ive addressed and made almost every change you suggested and explained the one i did not think its ready to go up 
 if i put s spoiler warning up and remove any speculational info can you put up the activity in the episodes section 
 it isnt a matter of whether or not there is a spoiler tag it is that the material isnt considered encyclopedic that level of detail about a series is better suited to a fan site or to the jericho wiki 
 im alerting you as i have seen your previous discussions on this matter as well as your intent to integrate the or comma attribute thanks again 
 thanks for your contributions 
 hm i dont know how that mistake happened i just looked at or next update and it said you authored the article anyway thanks for letting me know i have credited terrypin 
 i dont care what you would appreciate the matter was already settled until you and your buddy decided you own the page look at sylars entry and its history i am warning you that you will be reported if you feel threatened maybe you should look into what in your life causes you to feel victimized have a nice day 
 ok i propose a survey but i dont see the point what with the decision already being settled on the sylar page i mean do you see a point in repeating the same argument that was already settled elsewhere 
 thanks 
 to you and all im glad to have extended my appreciation and respect and am aonly apprehensive that i might have inadvertently missed one of my regular peers and colleagues if so and they are reading this please know its only my battered brain thats at fault 
 i have no idea why my edits to movie totals also impacted the longest running sctfi series it was unintentional dr who is by far the longest running and i do not consider the fact otherwise 
 sorry i accused you of something you didnt do i just wasnt sure what a stub was 
 and see 
 all this is possible but not something i am going to pursue it has been laborous to id diamonds as it is and my orginal suspicions proved wrong and it was only after i examined the diffs and the template work and then discovered other items that i saw what we were dealing with with and who honestly my involvement if this is accepted by arbcom is to post the evidence i have on the evidence page and walk away from it 
 i should have let you finish what you were doingsorry for the confusionits best if i dont get in the way of a master copyeditor i sure am glad that i didnt mess you up 
 its the same flag mate stars are in the same order and theres the same amount of stripes i dont see why the user generated one isnt better to use by using that one we are even away from any copyright issue 
 the user created flag isnt free nor is it better it looks like a botched photoshop imo i should really replace that screen capture though its really poor quality 
 he created it in paint and saved is as jpeg and thats it i dont see how you can get a better look at the flag other than having a usermade image of it unless of course one is provided by cbs which i doubt they will do 
 or from the episode its self which the flag is shown in 
 the curretn image is in so poor quality that it doesnt make sense to use it also i dont see why a usermade flag cannot be used 
 is there still a discussion page concerning asgardian hes back to his old editing ways again see wrecking crew 
 its only fair to say he seems to be cooperating with others now 
 i do not know why that user keeps changing the alternative views sentence the version that you are enforcing is obviously better thank you for keeping an eye on it 
 i left a message at 
 you are welcome and thanks however i dont recall ever designating the external links sections for references rather than further reading as to the inclusion of both references and external links sections thanks for the headsup however shouldnt all references be cited in the article thanks 
 i retract this statement further investigation shows discussion on all sides regarding the issues my apologies 
 indeed it isnt a press release thats my mistake for trying to read two things at once what matters though is it clearly states not making the cut freshman drama jericho im just as upset as you that jericho is cancelled but it doesnt look like theres any light at the end of the tunnel 
 have they made their announcement at carnegie hall yet then 
 its only a tv show but i feel quite sad i also feel slightly betrayed by the american network cbs it really sucks to leave shows on a cliff hanger ( 
 i suggest you and the other editors instigate a 
 the community sanction failed to gain consensus so is a dead duck and cant be enforced i strongly recommend you consider one of the two options above as they are to my mind the ones most likely to achieve something 
 further the rfc at 
 its not you that is the bother it is the processes i think we have all escalated this issue as best we can and i really think the two steps i have outlined above are the only two left 
 this picture needs a fair use thingy for the sylar article and for zachs own page could you do that please thanks 
 please 
 looks good but the user quentin x has reverted it claiming that i do not believe that it is good enough for zachary qunito can you do something about this i mean what the hell is wrong with using his character to see what zach looks like the fair use is proper isnt it if it meets all requirements i do not see the problem besides this one users opinion that the picture isnt good enough 
 sorry i must have deleted that bit by mistake i was trying to revert a mean sprited and potentially slanderous peice in the opening paragraph my bad 
 not at all i was a bit sceptical about eric idle being such a prat but i have just finished michael palins diaires and it appears he has prattish tendencies 
 it would appear we are as bad as each other 
 sorry it wasnt you the back and forth is giving me whiplash never mind 
 ok thanks for alerting me i have practically zero understanding on the subject i just picked 
 well i cant really say the countrys all that its cracket up to be but its still home and yes its good people from around the world are putting time and efforts into a project such as this very good sign of things to come uN 
 have you decided on a course of action regarding how to proceed either rfc or arbitration 
 superseded by below message 
 now im looking around and i can see two pages protected already this would be a third so im asking myself are we in a severe case of abuse there needs to be some thinking about how we all approach wikipedia are we here to collaborate for the benefit of the encyclopedia or enforce our own opinion 
 i hope the same doesnt happen with 
 and now 
 i have made a request for arbitration which lists you as an involved party please see 
 yeah i have been watching that arbitration case im not sure what i can add this time that i havent said several times before in discussions already linked to the case im skeptical as to what this particular arbitration case will accomplish given the history of how difficult it is to get outsiders to see the pattern of whats been going on and im inclined to think we are going to have to rethink our whole approach to this business realistically what do you expect will have to happen to make real progress in changing the nature of these edit wars 
 anyone who wants things to improve needs to talk about their own behavior and what they are going to do differently 
 im editing faster than you can build templates d 
 thank you very much i was wondering if you could say on the N N talk page why you are reverting the addition of the comma as people do seem to want it i left a message for you there 
 hey morphh i went ahead and created the 
 beautiful work on the article i will try to work on it here and there but i will be taking my bar exam in a couple of weeks so i devote sporadic amounts of time in between my final review for the exam 
 i have a feeling it would be more appropriate to remove this to 
 i agree with that i removed the report from aiv 
 hi tenebrae i havent seen you since i mediated the dispute over the dare devil page has everything been alright since then anyhow i saw your report to 
 wow its nice to be remembered everythings pretty good i have written some N biographies of comics professionals including a lot of legendary golden age and silver age veterans that were missing (the young whippersnappers dont know 
 writing N entries is commendable and deserves recognition 
 please accept my sincerest apologies for my horrible horrible vote on your rfa to borrow a timehonored phrase i dont know what was going through my head i guess i got confused amongst a latiny username and a greeky username once again im terribly sorry and i hope the rfa doesnt drag you down too much good luck 
 absolutely no need to apologize we all make mistakes i know i do and mdash and nbsp and nbsp 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or keep up the great work 
 thats impressive i think i have somewhere around N articles i have created but most are stubs or are far to short to really mean too much to me my real proud and joys are lacated 
 eh the real worlds overrated lol no enjoy it im going to drop off once im done with this hulk thing 
 you guys are the best 
 i am 
 me too 
 i am encouraging everyone to discuss the issue at 
 or styletextaligncenter border N px solid black background#ccccff or thank you very much for your support in 
 ok well now we are on to 
 sup ten i see you created this article i was watching the old cartoon 
 thanks if you want i will provide a screenshot of the cartoon where his name appears on the closing credits 
 lol i also saw 
 done 
 oh and two reception links enjoy 
 i will see if i can find some more stuff tomorrow to be frank frink is the only one worth saving we should rebrand radioactive man so the comic is the primary focus dr nick cletus and wolfcastle really are not worth fighting over they will work fine as a nicely sourced section of the list they are not really developed characters all three are basically one joke lionel hutz could be saved though but im amazed the guy didnt nominate 
 sounds like a plan this afd highlights the one thing i hate about this place we dont really get any praise at all for the work we do but then when somebody nominates a simpsons page for deletion you get all these people popping up with good riddance theres too many simpsons articles they dont belong here they are all cruft great to see them be deleted etc its so frustrating when almost always we are the ones trying to get rid of the stuff it makes me wonder when i bother 
 heres a source for reception of frinks inventions 
 while not ttn trouble it does show why that proposing discussion will get you nowhere if the fans object in any real way he had to be blocked for breaking the N rr with other people to stop and i would classify him as one of the less obsessive ones 
 talk pages must adhere to the same policies and guidelines as article pages the rambling comments above represent disallowed 
 i hope this helps 
 anyway lets not use the rules to 
 none of this is meant personally i have seen your edits for many moons and i know you are a responsible and meticulous editor im simply responding to questions of fact in your statements and i wholeheartedly support your larger notion of trying to ensure civility even while i might be personally perplexed about this particular example clearly im a chamomile guy 
 my goal in making this a subsection was to allow you two to continue discussing without this metadiscussion thread interfering and no breach of wikiquette intended read further down 
 says fallen into disuse but thats ok we are cool in fact just by pure coincidence i posted my complete supportive agreement to your post on another page about the amalgam comics mess small world huh 
 as one of several editors active in the project probably not so small 
 yeah N for spiderman N im pretty sure im at the top of the list for that article next is smallville right now im trying to crank out this new season format as im reorganizing im coming to the realization that certain episodes have like N sentence of information in a given sentence so im fretting having to smooth it out because if i cant then it means it really doesnt have a place at all i think i can get it all together in a nice way so that it doesnt come off as just a paragraph worth of production trivia we will see 
 i dont know if you mean the 
 i chose the table format to keep it all neater and limit the prospect that people will put overly long plots in them i could probably expand on whats in them a bit but my idea was that they should be proportional to the amount of production information they have i didnt want to have plots that were larger than their real world content i mean i didnt see a reason to detail shimmer if i had absolutely nothing to say about it that said i dont mean to say there should be one plot thats huge and one thats thing i was trying to keep them equal to each other but we will see how it all looks when i get the last two episodes finished tempest will most likely be its own article because it actually has indepth coverage im sure once i get all the points turned into prose that i will make more adjustments to the format if you look at my note i didnt originally intend to have more than a production header but the way the information became spaced i realized i needed subs 
 trying to get some feedback how do you think 
 take your time its just one section anyway which will probably grow im having difficulty finding any criticism on metamorphosis and since there isnt a lot of information on it it may be merged back into the season page i wont know till i continue my search and until i get through the meet the crew section of my book i will be out of town all weekend so it wont get much work anyway i think it turned out alright needs to copyediting but i always save that stuff for last then again i have bias 
 we cant review an article that has nothing but a plot as there wouldnt be anything to review the idea behind the review isnt to help find information its to assess if the article is close to meeting the standards and just needs more time with maybe some helpful pointers on what to do if you still only have a plot after N days then what is there to review review all the nonfree content 
 you havent given up have you 
 i completely understand that new season format is just about complete it needs serious copyediting which i wont worry about till i put it up but the only big thing left to do is go through some links i have in my favorites and proseup the reception section 
 i like your wording of the introductory sentence better thanks 
 nope i was working in specific sections when you did that so it didnt affect me i didnt even notice you had changed it till i went to remove the inuse tag and notice the lead sentence was different then i realized someone changed it and just checked the history yeah pilot titles are weird because they are generally referred to as the pilot and not pilot i think the way you wrote it should be implented for 
 re of 
 i have reverted all your edits so no harm done thanks for genuinely trying to help though 
 thanks for the help and welcome back the guy who put the series of tags on the page for a while suggested building up that N s section as notable showing that it affected later writers seems like a legitimate way to show its notability i had another citation for it as its just an interview but i didnt have any way to prove that the other sources were reprinting with permission had it been a wizard review or a promo peice about upcoming stories i certainly would have avoided it but an interview is the usual exception to most sources so long as they have got enough credibility to assure they dont edit and revise interviews i think wizard passes that criterion 
 im assuming from your reply that you are ok with me using that citation so im going to readd it if i misinterpreted please talk page it before removing thanks 
 i finally finished 
 i went ahead and dumped it on the mainspace its been in proposal since may N with no actual objections id still appreciate a read from you when you get the time im sure you are busy as am i i guess that means i can legitimately redirect the episode pages for at least that season 
 im glad someone else is seeing this i saw you had to have a chat with robin before it seems she does something you correct her and then she either does it again or just simply does something else that proves to be just as wrong i have gotten to the point that i have ignore the delinking in all the citations and the removal of what she considered extra space but i get annoyed when she rewords sentences so that they are no longer a representation of the citation she labels things as minor and then removed N characters and not all are simply removing spaces sigh anyway how are things where you are editing 
 i joined the canadian military but found it wasnt actually what i wanted to do live and learn i guess i was gone for just about all of october and little bit of november once i got back i rediscovered the addiction that is wikipedia editing 
 ah thats why my ears were burning i sensed that someone somewhere had mentioned me 
 if the reference to buffy and sugar bombs is too trivial then so is the one for the marvel comics runaways since it uses the same trivial reference as well there is no comic i can find listing lucky so that should be removed as well 
 done thanks for mentioning those two 
 no problem i hate removing things on my own not N per cent sure yet what is valid and what isnt by the way i noted the trivia warning and am attempting to make that section a prose rather than a list would love your comments before i post it 
 what i did on the the mottos article wasnt at all a experiment or a test i fixed a grave mistake made by someone who knew nothing about iranian motto 
 my apologies 
 yeah you are correct but isnt it better to emphasize that they are still formally at war thanks 
 thanks 
 thanks i had not noticed the 
 just thought i would let you know o and thanks for changing it back to the yellowjacket image 
 honestly i forgot where i got it from N or if you find a better image please replace it honestly i liked the original image but hey w or e 
 and i found the url at least N or hope this helps 
 its not gramatically incorrect its his name hence in the credits it says the master not master the full name of the uk isnt the uk 
 interesting i guess it is google maps however shows a beach with that distinctive multiple arcs or points on the north of the university endowment lands i dont think i saw one with that design anywhere on the downtown pininsula where sunset beach is 
 oh i checked agian and there is 
 seriously people are still fighting over that buscema article well dont let it bring you down just make your case simply with the plain facts remember to include more links to back your key points this time around my meager unaskedfor advice chin up 
 ok so i think this article has been being disputed for a year now this is the longest debate i have seen N p anyway if you need or are allowed to have any help on this just give me a buzz on my talk cause i do think that the article that everyone agreed on at the rfc all those months ago was a good looking one 
 i noticed your reversion of most of my reversion of some punctuation in the 
 thanks for the note my changes werent based on the ukus differences but on the 
 interesting for putting punctuation outside quotation marks is in direct violation of the rules of proper english as taught in my formal education from beginning to end i even had difficulty with more than one teacher when i would write a question that ended with a direct quotethe question mark would not be part of the quoted material but the teachers wanted it inside the quote marks simply because of that rule i still think that this rule still exists and in general believe it is right so i will check the wiki style guide you linked in and perhaps raise the issue on a talk page there however you did previously revert the punctuation location in the dialogue quote i cited no offense but the history listings there will prove it 
 asked in smith and jones whether he had a brother the doctor replied not any more the last three words are according to the passage dialogue from the programme as a hypothetical example of commas within quotation marks for titles when one has a series of such titles the comma between each would be within the quote marks according to my teachers and the textbooks issued in their classes 
 my most humble apologies you are correct it was not you before very very sorry for some reason i just assumed the same person jumped back in but not so my bad 
 you are accusing rtkatN of doing a lot of splits and merges which he either did not do at all or did loooong ago either way its an uncivil way to start discussing merges as for the merges themselves some should stand some should not 
 (responded to this at 
 we are collegial and i respect you as an editor but when i read the comments you have made about this subject they look far too alarmist and accusatory his edits come off to me at least as instances of wpbold i dont agree with all of them but can discuss them rationally without gettign upset that he was bold he was bold and these look to be good faith edits not vandalism or point violations lets approach each one rationally thats all im saying 
 well for one thing it is unsourced second it seems nonnotable third there is a conflict of interest on your part in the edits fourth please figure out how to fit into wikipedia including signing your posts on talk pages with ~~~~ 
 this arbitration case has closed and the final decision is available at the link above 
 i hope the closure of the case will bring closure to the whole situation everyone had their chance to air whatever grievances they had they have all been considered and it is now time to move on 
 i thought a nuetral mention of fin fang flame appearing in jlx unleashed was enough of a source for 
 edit seems that a bunch of other edtiors decided for reasons i am having difficulty figuring out that amalgam appereances in actual produced comic books arent worthy enough for alternate versions sections something i disagree with but if you have anything in reply here i will listen

 if you need the text you can view an and paste it into the from there you can work on it i didnt want to remove a lot of text because i noticed you put so much work into the article restoring to before your edits would likely remove a lot of good contributions to the article 
 thanks the page was roughly N or N the size it is now before i began work on it in may i dont see the page as needing an overhaul as one editor has suggested i think it would be easier if the concerned parties were more specific as to what needs rewording it seems that because of the wording of one passage it is assumed that the entire article needs to be rewritten i have put several months of research and effort into the page and presently simply do not have the time to rewrite or reresearch the entire article all over again i feel the quickest and easiest way to remedy any problems is for the concerned parties to simply point them out and i will be more than happy to correct them again the one problem that was pointed out could have been remedied with a quick rewording and i am puzzled as to why that did not occur by any of the concerned parties here 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our 
 i have fixed this one the bot tags images where the article for which fair use is claimed is not specified which as far as i can see is all that was wrong with the fur 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our 
 simple fur added feel free to improve it 
 i was looking through the afds and 
 um i think you should read 
 at least one of us can read 
 this reginald character seems to loose his or her temper a lot have you had much experience with them it seems like they were extremely uncivil on the potter talk page then the conversation carried over to 
 i noticed they made some similar uncivil comments to others on various pages but not the straight yelling and attacks i got on the consensus page oh well i took that page off my list i dont particularly care to listen to his or her rants any longer you participating in any episode discussions 
 unfortunately that note isnt referenced either and we cannot use wikipedia pages to reference other wikipedia pages i have added a citation request to the liar liar text if one turns up you can restore the text 
 i can assist you with your sockpuppet report against him will you like me to just fill it out for you 
 i filled out the evidence part for you and added it to the report page edit it any way you like 
 per is there an sop for not utilizing the language variable in citation templates if the reference is in english while there are no other references in other languages how does stipulating these as english cause confusion because the article is english and the subject is in english that doesnt follow that the references will be in english having references tagged as english seems to be clearer and less ambiguous than not uN 
 as well the lack of citations using languageenglish would lead one to think that such usage is discouraged thoughts 
 in the comics articles we specify fictional character biography as a way to meet numerous wikipedia guidelines especially those about making fiction clear and to keep from having to rewrite fictional biographies in weird warys to avoid writing them inuniverse many many people have weighed in on developing this 
 is considered to be redundant by whom a fictional character has both real world behindthescenes history and a fictional biography specifying which is which would not be inherently redundant do you have specific wikiproject television guidelines and exemplars you are referring to i ask because im sure i have probably added fictional in a section heading on some tv characters bio at some point out of sheer habit myself 
 please check 
 its technically not a N rr violation and he hasnt been warned in fact im not even sure hes aware of the rule 
 four reverts in under N hours thats a N rr violation read the N rr guidelines it does not have to be a N per cent page revert every time each time he reverts the name of that darn movie that counts as for the warning no i cant find that he was ever warned about N rr he will probably only get a warning for it but then again hes gotten plenty of other warnings and is not a brand new user at this point so a brief block is possible the requirement about a past warning is mainly for new users 
 ah id been looking at the more recent edits not the ones you reported it still would have been better to warn first and then report if further violations were made i rather question how much of the rules hes picked up 
 result was N hour block he got warned immediately reverted again despite the pending N rr decision and then got blocked 
 assuming that you dont object to these then i presume your objection is to the way i used the image on my page not to the image per se what exactly is the objection then i wasnt using the image in a misleading way or for profit i was using it to make my page into a fauxversion of a comic book character page regardless of whether i succeeded in being funny the deliberate comparision is clear (compare the actual 
 im glad you are asking the fairuse rationale is that the image is being discussed or used to describe something being discussed fairuse images are for wikipedia articles only and do not belong in any other namespace i got the humor but it doesnt matter what else is on your page the images being there violates its copyright i apologize for any distress this may have caused you you didnt do anything wrong you just didnt know that bit of the complex information surrounding fair use and it looks like you are doing a good job contributing as well 
 hi permission is complete for the solo image has this been uploaded yet if so i will go ahead and log it if not let me know when it is and i will take care of it asap 
 oh my god thank you so so much the simpsons wikiproject has been looking for an image of her for years i never thought emailing her would work the file is located here 
 too bad the article has already appeared in the dyk section if it hadnt the image could have been featured on the main page 
 oh well at least the article has a really nice picture i will just track down a commons admin to delete the other image the one thats been cleared is good to go and i will leave you the thrill of placing it d go you with your initiative 
 i see you tagged it for speedy i just confirmed 
 thanks by the way have you sent anything to maggie since you received the email from the photographer 
 oh yes i had to ask her to specify the license and after she did i said a pleased thank you 
 great thanks i think i will send her a thank younote too and let her know that the image has been added to the article 
 please do a page move to change the name of the article from 
 move completed 
 for the abitration committee and mdash and nbsp 
 i appreciate the thanks but it should really be directed at the arbitrators and not myself and mdash im just the messenger and the solomonic virtues would be entirely theirs and mdash and nbsp 
 did anyone notify you of a report against you 
 no i never received notification of the case against me i have asked 
 the ip N is used by skyelarke as per this edit summary however i dont think that this is a 
 N xaN it may not be when looking at the article talk but it is a little dubious when looking at the complaint to arbcom that generated the warning below 
 i did consider that skyelarke anonymously filing an grievance might violate the part about 
 is going to be prone to people changing the correct canadian air date to the american one tonight the episode on your ctv on the N th 
 hey what do you think about listing american airdates with the original one i personally dont think its a good idea as then every other airdate should be there im a bitch according to to cuddlecakes p 
 i have cleaned up the section to remove nonencyclopedic text and assertions we will see what the reaction is 
 of course there would have to be citation for it but if we know what we are looking for it might make the searching a bit more pointed thoughts 
 since im the first to post at 
 oh and happy new year to you too 
 tenebrae im looking at the edit history of 
 im sorry to hear about your mother im at a loss of how else to respond my heart goes out to you like you say its almost the last position any child wants to be in take care and dont let this place add to the stress 
 no worries however taking a turn back to wikipedia you have posted messages all over the place regarding this incident and you have got different people running around trying to fix the issue and its complicating the issue i suggest in the future you stick to one method the wikipedia wide pages such as 
 robocop is a crazy communist muslim bastard who has killed many in recent days 
 im sure he is must be cold in south dakota 
 N please cite your edit and there will be no problem 
 hey buddy the ip you have reported is already blocked for vandalism and hasnt edited since yesterday 
 my bad he had edited once but lets wait and see what happens 
 hello tenebrae is there a reason you dont have email this user enabled if there is would you email me with an address i can write to you at i have a matter i would like to discuss you offwiki 
 well is there any chance that you could create a throwaway account at say gmail or yahoo i definitely dont want to infringe on your privacy regardless of the reason but i would like to keep this matter offwiki so both of us can speak privately 
 i have replied to the talk page i will add only that as you are very familiar with 
 ckatzs actions are quite right as per policy (
 the consensus of a small group doesnt override that of the site the current standards held within 
 thank you for admitting that ttn hopefully you will discuss before declaring consensus now where there is none 
 again consensus lies in the policies and guidelines of the site not fans just because a bunch of you object doesnt mean anything in regards to it i know that you dont like 
 would you care to provide something that supports you as it stands im not able to see a line of text that supports you remotely 
 hmm i dont knowthe fact that the polices and guidelines require real world notability established by reliable sources for all topics and that if topics cannot establish that notability its removed regardless of how many people like the topic 
 to quote the guideline itself articles about fictional topics that are notable should be given time to develop and several users have established notability for multiple articlesuN even so i notice these are being redirected anyway the consensus on the talk page is that these articles can be improved with secondary sources ergo will be given the time to be improved id say one year is a reasonable allotment of time 
 nothing has shown that all the episodes can be improved only the first episode has anything going for it and what it has barely does a thing for it four or five episodes random episodes would have to be completely fleshed out for all to be safe what you are talking about is just a silly fan blanket that holds no water 
 exactly sorry to be repetitive but consensus is apparently misunderstood by matthew ckatz and others when consensus is referred to in wikipedia discussion it always means within the framework of established policy and practice editors weighing in on a specific topic on a talk page does not trump the larger community consensus matthew and ckatz you should bring up your views at the ongoing debates on fiction and notability voting against a merge at the talk page is of no consequence as long as those guidelines and policies are extant and supported 
 thank you eusebeus for providing a reply that supports me because these policies clearly dont support you please also remember that we dont vote on wikipedia 
 do you need any help with the farscape issue ckatz i dont think that the episodes should be deletedi have made a number of contributions to the pagesso i am happy to add links to show relevance or whatever though that will take a lot more time than just adding summaries and such which is what i was doing before i think its silly to get rid of all the work we have already done just because we havent added those extra supporting bits yet 
 matthew i think you are being deliberately obtuse with this mindless gainsaying i quoted the key provision in the consensus policy it always means within the framework of established policy and practice unfortunately your desire to retain individual episode articles contravenes established practice and policy which requires realworld notability and reliable third party sources i am not suggesting that this cannot change but you need to take up the discussion at the main policy page grousing on the farscape talk page is not meaningful you need to change communitywide views on notability through the presentation of a limpid argument as to why tv episodes should not be subject to the same standard of notability i also agree with ttns point above there is no compelling evidence that as the guidelines and polciies currently stand any of these episodes can satisfy the criteria 
 im looking at the discography right now and i have noticed that 
 i have supported the discographys nomination i just noticed that it appears that the solo music videos table has no bottom line could this be fixed that aside its a very nice list good work 
 im not interested frankly in a pointless war of words with you however i will say that it is very telling that you chose to respond to a disagreement over content with a carefully veiled personal jibe that being the insinuation of vandalism on my part i wont dwell on the insulting nature of your comment other than to note that a even the most cursory examination of my contribution history would demonstrate that i spend an enormous percentage of my time on wikipedia aremoving vandalism and b you obviously couldnt be bothered to make such an obvious essential check of said records before hitting save it is also interesting to point out that according to your note on this page my actions border on vandalism because i am very familiar with wikipedias policies however at the 
 well i am sorry i misspoke and you are right to note the discrepancy between my two comments but i suspect nonetheless that you know what i mean more importantly would you care to address the actual issue at hand namely have you attempted to amend the notability guidelines in the relevant fora and if so with what result if you havent i would appreciate not having policydriven actions reverted simply because you happen to be a fan of the series 
 i think this is another case of 
 he reverted your reverts so i reverted his reverts 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our 
 tenebrae im adding a fur to this image but it doesnt currenly appear on any article if you want it to be ultimately kept you might want to attach it to some appropriate article 
 well if you think of something before valentines day you can keep it otherwise looks like its gone 
 are we kidding she took the photo of us with my camera at my request is this not splitting hairs are you an admin if she opens an account logs on and i request permission to upload will you grant it this is really ridiculous honestly 
 no one is reading your repetitive and lengthy comments any more they all say the same thing you dont listen to or care about any responses and you are not having a dialogue with anyone anyway please cut it out and stick to the professional and small topic you didnt take the picture your wife did shes the copyright holder let her send an email the rest of this stuff is just so far out 
 what does the indicia say 
 and just because its wrong in other articles isnt license to keep on doing it wrong or pushing to revert to the wrong format 
 yeah i remember our going over this before i remember pulling out some old issues and looking at the indicia now that you mention it 
 when i initially informed the above user that i was going to scale back his N paragraph entry about N box seats he took the first shot by making a patronizing remark about my grammar so he didnt exactly start out very civilly either 
 i will just comment that bugs may have been guilty of 
 one subject i am very sensitive to is spam and advertising and my radar is constantly up for it on articles that i watch given that it took him N edits to post the two paragraphs initially its possible that he actually is a newbie and not just a singlepurpose account and that i responded to a beanshooter with full artillery 
 yes reviewing everything i think the issue wasnt that lmusielak was advertising himself or had any improper 
 another behavior of spammers is to try to post something and then feign anger and disappear i would welcome the user to prove my suspicions wrong and become a useful editor 
 i guess it is possible that i got the account and made changes to random pages in order to make it look like i wasnt a spammer but seriously who would pick harvey wallbanger as their first edit i appreciate wikipedia but if one has to go through this to prove the veracity of their status as an editor each time a contribution is made it is miraculous so many have chose to contribute i had a fbi background check recently that was less in depth then the inquisition into the age and purpose of my account on wikipedia 
 im done with this topic its up to the user whether to continue editing or not no one blocked him for his N rr violation no one is stopping him from posting edits that are within the rules 
 i thought you were in on those discussions 
 why is it correct to format certain episode titles with quotes while most are italicized 
 thanks for asking theres a long explanation or discussion about the formatting at the doctor who project page in a nutshell wikipedia convention is to use quotation marks for episode titles the dw project however got into the habit of using italics instead i think due to the fact that many titles refer to multiepisode serials rather than single episodes the convention initially carried over to the new series but more recently consensus was reached to move toward conforming with wikipedias guidelines the new episodes were done first im not sure what the plan is for the older ones hope this helps 
 no im talking about something from much further back than that i dont know the discussion of N months ago 
 while a postal indicia and a trademarked logo are valid in different ways the least confusing thing for a generalaudience reader is to use the trademarked logo that is highly visible on the cover and on the cover illustrations but even if we dont want to use the trademarked logo a distinction can still be made between an adjective and a simple definite article 
 i see that you have reverted my edits to heroes where i added a seperate sections for current and former character and also added dates to leaving or joining characters your reason was that it was nonstandard (which i dispute see (
 there are several issues with regards to how you restructured the section first off there is no need whatsoever to separate former and current cast members we treat the series as a whole and the cast list reflects it as such similarly your use of years isnt the most effective way of representing cast information as a viewers tend to think in terms of seasons rather than years and b the series is broadcast internationally and wikipedia itself is international what north america sees as current is not necessarily so for other regions personally i have no problem with indicating when a character joined or left a series but given the problems with your changes as a whole the only viable option was a revert hope this answers your questions please feel free to ask if you have more 
 first im not american and yeah i considered using seasons instead would it be okay if i didnt seperate them into sections and instead of putting in years i add seasons next to former and new cast members i mean just keeping it the way it the way it is except also adding dates to people who joined in season N or were recurring previously and people who have left will it be alright 
 something simple such as or might be suitable 
 are the characters organized in a specific structure currently if so what is it and if not i have hardly made it harder to read 
 alphabetical order as per most other series articles with your list there was no easy way to find characters some were alphabetical others were grouped at the bottom 
 thus by this convoluted logic unsupported by any evidence all off line citations of published matter are threatened because it might be possible that the authors could have retracted the statements they published maybe somewhere if anyone can find a retraction or even one statement published anywhere that says there is a dispute over who founded fics then perhaps there could be some water held in this sieve of an argument and this is typical of what i perceive to be essentially the vandalism that was done to the article if you are going to punish me for telling the truth then so be it i am about ready to stop working for this group anyway i am not sure it is worth my time to continue under these circumstances i am convinced that the editor who started this edit war has some gripe with me as an editor and took out his frustrations on the bio of 
 oh i just caught this line i am about ready to stop working for this group anyway i am not sure it is worth my time to continue under these circumstances please do quit you are just interfering and causing all sorts of problems that would not be here otherwise i will write all of the articles up ktr will check them others will monitor them on wikipedia they will be appropriate wellwritten properly sourced neutral biographies useful encyclopedia articles please 
 how do you undo an edit without undoing anything in between i mean when theres an edit you want to undo but its two changes back how do you undo that edit without undoing the most recent ones thanks for the help 
 useful feature indeed there is an undo link in the page history click it to have the option of undoing that edit alternatively if you need to remove several edits in a row use the diffs option and undo that note that the edit will fail if there have been changes to the selected text in the meantime for example if editor a vandalises a section and editor b edits a different section you can undo editor a however if editor b makes a change to the same section of text you cant undo editor as change you could however undo editors a and b if editor c hasnt changed that section and so on this might not be the clearest explanation please let me know if that is the case cheers 
 looks like we have a problem there 
 i think it might be best if 
 my gut feeling is it might be better if both of us took some time off from the article and the arbitrations proscription is as good as any theres no reason either of us should be obsessive 
 fair enough and that said i would have to agree while i appreciate your enthusiasm in wanting to help with the article as soon as possible and the arbcomm ruling doesnt prohibit such a discussion i think we may be overstepeping beyond the spirit of the ruling by starting such an overall discussion so soon after the closure lets just give this some more time 
 hello i just wanted to thank you for your comments both on the deleted dab page and on the administrators board i was quite upset about the whole issue and so was very pleased to see your words thanks 
 no worries the whole thing was quite bizarre i must say keep up the good work 
 finally you wrote used to abuse policy would be an entirely different matter for the record i do not believe and didnt mean anyone to read into my comments that i suspected the other contributor had set out to abuse policy what i remain concerned has happened is that a long term quality control volunteer who is doing a task that other quality control volunteers consider important has innocently slipped into a pattern of editing that lapses from what is best for the project overall we are all supposed to be accountable for what we do here and what we say with circumscribed exceptions at the highest level our decisionmaking is supposed to be made in an open and transparent manner i remain concerned that the other contributors use of multiple userids is not open and transparent but rather is opaque and obfuscates their accountability 
 firstly i did respond and deliberately left the talk page undeleted but someone else came in an hour behind me and deleted it i had written on the talk page the above is an abuse of the hangon tag to personally attack another editor the grounds for deletion were perfectly reasonable as it only has one bluelinked entry secondly to the grounds for deletion read specifically disambiguates two or fewer wikipedia topics and whose title ends in this page disambiguated two entries only one of which was bluelinked as such it was a page without reason to exist and indeed one which mos appears to advise against and thirdly you have expended a great deal of effort opposing a speedy deletion exhibiting 
 clearly other quality control volunteers think her disambiguation work is important and i am sure it would be possible for her to go right on working on this task just as effectively in a way that was open transparent and didnt obfuscate her multiple roles 
 why are they being deleted there on evey other page i was just bringing those shows so evey N show is the same look at other shows i didnt create those but there still there its encyclopedia type information because people can see if a show is in danger of cancellation please can we work this out i also noticed you put non encylcopedic charts what makes them encylcopedic charts please get back to me asap 
 you still have not gotten back to me but you had time to remove it once again every page old shows and new have a nielsen ratings page i believe it should stay because it presents info about the show 
 there are many bits of information about shows that do not qualify for inclusion countless bits of trivia are added on a daily basis across the television articles some are deemed suitable for an encyclopedia article while many others are removed does it mean the subject material isnt interesting not necessarily just that it is not appropriate for wikipedia take a look at the the articles for mature series those such as 
 i see why you deleted ratings for 
 i was just wondering the same thing tv articles are supposed to describe how well a show is received and this seems like one of the few scientific indicators of a shows reception over a period of time how does averaging a shows performance over a whole season demonstrate this in a better way than on a week by week basis 
 i have had to remove the text again while i appreciate the coincidence the reality is that without some form of proof as to a connection it is not considered to be encyclopedic are the games creators stargate fans perhaps but computer games are released around this time anyways to meet the christmas season are stargate atlantis producers fans of the game again perhaps but it is highly unlikely that they would alter the plot development of a season to match a game release date that could well change on short notice however if you feel strongly about it please bring it up on the articles talk page 
 i would like to know what you think about my prospects for an rfa i have been here a while now and would like to help out more i would appreciate if you would consider coaching me for adminship if you have the time 
 sorry to disappoint you but unfortunately i am pretty much inactive at this moment i wish you luck 
 no i wasnt aware that the comics club had called for a superfluous biography header and your application of it to 
 dont presumptuously thank me for understanding a standard which i find shortsighted and ideosyncratic thats incredibly condescending even though you say that we drafted an example outline for comics creators those articles are first and foremost biographies not comics articles and the standards for biographical articles in wikipedia as a whole apply if you look around wikipedia you will find a wealth of biographical articles that dont clutter themselves up with a biography header and theres a reason for that your exemplar seems to have been drafted on the assumption that a persons biography is something separate from their professional work and dave sim is a perfect demonstration of where this assumption breaks down even if there is information in an article about a person that is not strictly biographical it is quite common that the majority of it will be maybe you are too stuck thinking of comics articles in terms of character articles where their socalled biographies are just one aspect of the subject but for a person thats simply not the case at least not as a rule 
 i can only see that your precious exemplar contains inappropriate demands 
 i didnt see the development of a congenial consensus or any discussion whatsoever about the example template thats why i started a discussion about that aspect of it against my better judgment to be honest im not a member of wikiproject comics and thats almost entirely because of you when i first bumped up against you i was warned by other editors to steer clear of you and i have subsequently seen the kind of meanspirited pissing contests you engage in you treat people like retarded children then get upset when they dont kowtow to you these fights you start are counterproductive and detrimental to the civility of wikipedia i dont know if you treat people with such condescension on purpose to stoke your ego or if you just dont know how to get along well with your peers but i do think you should be aware of the impact it has on wikiproject comics im sure you do a lot to help and i admire the patience of those who put up with your eccentricity but i cant help wondering how much positive it works out to on balance 
 i find it remarkable that someone who flames your talk page with needlessly personal invective and unsupported claims that amount to slander can make accusations about a persons character i feel badly that someone for whatever personal reasons finds it necessary to answer politeness with vicious acrimony when people cannot debate on the merits of their cases they insult the other party and put up smokescreens i would like to suggest a compromise but given what i have seen from your words and actions i dont know that it would accepted in the spirit in which it is genuinely offeredtenebrae N N february N 
 your comments do not appear to be polite i have found them insulting from the very first if you dont want to understand how others perceive you thats not my shortcoming 
 i need to point out that i never called you childish names that behavior would be your shortcoming and perhaps it is possible and worth considering that you misinterpreted simple politesse 
 separate question there are five 
 almost midnight and you are still doing wiki work this is dedication beyond the normi usually knock off by N pm i will try to remember to delete the stub template when i rate an article as start class in future thanks for the note so far as the top races in each country are concerned i do not consider them as core thoroughbred racing topics which would be rated are top importance but as historically significant which is high importance thanks for your help in the assessments regards 
 morning cuddy as you may have noticed i have now completed my pass through 
 you are right to go with your gut on that 
 if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the 
 regarding the dragonfly when i snapped the picture it was holding on to a grainy wall thanks 
 to me it doesnt make any difference if jeff wants a better crop and if you have the time to do so i would appreciate it but if you are busy let me know and i will try to do something myself 
 thanks for the advice regarding the new picture with the pink flowers in the background i thought it looked nice with the pink so i left them there but i also took another picture without the pink flower 
 hi i was behind the ip the edited the actors studio page regarding kavners exit i suppose i could be wrong but i was of the mindset that that was a fairly well known fact about julie kavner in fact her own article here on wiki (
 no problem at all and thanks for the note in return i have restored your edit and added a request for a citation instead (i saw the note you have pointed out at 
 butting in here im going to undo it again i was in the audience for this episode and while its true that she left and its true that she didnt want to be seen performing as marge she didnt leave because she didnt want to be seen she performed onstage but she held a cardboard cutout of marge over her face when she did their voices she left because she had another committment she had a train to catch 
 courcelles has instituted general sanctions on all abortion related articles including N rr be careful 
 bizarre every editor is now subject to sanctions because of the incessant disruptive behaviour of a single editor well he cant help himselfthis will certainly result in a topic ban for himonly a matter of timeno self control 
 what did i tell you wow that was fast but only N hrs how does he keep getting away with these slaps on the wrist i wonder if theres any chance of getting gs lifted when he finally gets topic banned 
 hello you asked for an example of another article or section that used the tag if you go to the heroes main page someone has placed the tag i believe it was placed on the season N plot synopsis section i may be wrong about which section exactly but if you scroll down the heroes main page you will find an identical tag please write me back and let me know what you discovered thanks 
 thanks that was added without discussion by an ip a few days back it also shouldnt be there and has been removed 
 oh okay glad we cleared that up i wont use the tag again 
 to what do you refer i have never heard of anything besides afd 
 there is a review process for television articles the preferred course of action if article notability is questioned is to redirect deletion is strongly discouraged 
 hey ckatz realy thank you for pointing me out 
 no problem at the time i wasnt aware the article had been merged thanks for the note 
 i will go for the fact that you are you on commons too i have sorted the admin board request cheers 
 comes with the territory you are welcome cheers 
 looks like the bot automatically removed it you might want to post to 
 sorry to say this but i believe that you have misunderstood the actual events if you will refer to the edit history it will reveal what really happened by ip N deleted the geography section and replaced it with the racist material you described four minutes later ip N labelling it racism and spam your edit was done over twoandonehalf hours later and resulted in the second with a thusmisleading edit description deleted a pointless and stupid racist comment that is what i reverted an unexplained deletion by a lowedit ip account with an edit description that had no correlation with what was actually done given the inherent discrepancy between the comment and the action and given that you were editing with an ip address and given that it was the first edit from that ip address in almost two months i feel my actions were entirely appropriate and justified the only thing i can think of is that you saw the racist vandalism in the edit history didnt realize that it had been removed and thought you were removing it why you would delete an entire section however i cannot explain im sorry that this happened to you but i would respectfully state that it is you in fact who should have checked the facts before making unsubstantiated and incorrect accusations against me 
 if youd like to speedy that version of traditional marriage movement that you are keeping around as a security blanket that would be appreciated but if you have other things to do thats fine too 
 not really sure what you mean by security blanket 
 hey the infomation that powerless may act as the season finale pending the resolution of the dispute is currently out of date and obviously incorrect according to greg beeman and tim kring a director of heroes and the creator of heroes the quote i placed explains the situation however id like it if you can please put that large quote into prose so the quote doesnt take up the entire introduction thanks 
 are you joking look im as disappointed as the next heroes fan but this infomation is straight from a guy who literally works behind the scenes and creates heroes he has directed multiple episodes of heroes and he writes his blog as an insider he works on the set of heroes he gets paid to do that im not sure how anyone can disagree with what he said its like jk rowling saying that the N th book was alwaysmeant to be the last book and you somehow looking for a way that there will be an eightth book or something they showed volume three villains at the end of the last episodehow more definate do you want to get we have infomation from the episode stating that its the season finale and from the director who it quoting the creator of heroes so i dont understand what the issue is here sources go out of date all the time thats why we have an edit button to update infomation 
 hmm well thats much better however i still disagree with including and may act as the season finale pending the resolution of the dispute the infomation from greg beeman contradicts that 
 the blog doesnt say thisis the season finale it says that it is even more resolved and complete if god forbid the strike goes on so long that there is no more of season N than the first eleven beeman also says that they have every intention of producing more episodes for season two if they are able to 
 greg beeman is one confusing guy because he also states that episode N will be i mean we saw at the end of the episode volume three villains just like what happened at the end of volume one heh whatever the infomation is okay now but i wouldnt doubt it if theres a disagreement later on by wikipedians over this subject 
 oh im sure the debates will rage on endlessly the confusion comes because of krings desire to make smaller volumes or storylines the season consists of an order of N episodes and N episodes however this year the volumes are shorter last years genesis ran for N episodes all of season one while generations was intended to run for N episodes and villains for N episodes to make up season two 
 oh holy shit that is confusing god damnit at first i loved the concept of a comic book inspired show but this is bullshit 
 tons of articles head the list of numbered textual footnotes as references and more than a few also have sources end of discussion 
 i was in the middle of something and in a hurry to get back to it and i found your original argument far less than convincing so i apologize for my abrupt tone that said when you have arbitrary policy on one hand and general practice the vast majority of which is going unchallenged and is not inherently problematical on the other hand the majority rules (note that our going back and forth from each others talk pages is counter to stated policy as quoted to me 
 absolutely fair and thank you for obviously accepting my apology for my tone 
 the 
 i think i stuck that in the middle of my statement as part of the fallout he apparently lost bot approval rights 
 actually thats probably fine for now i will most likely draft a separate statement in a few hours clarifying the issue i should have paid closer attention to what you wrote but i have never been involved with an arbcom case before and didnt know much about it 
 thanks 
 digger is a favorite article of mine amoung the ones i have created with all of the afds in the comics project recently i have been worried that this article could be put up for deletion if that happens i want it to live or die on the merits of what it is 
 hi their thanks for stepping in on 
 conrad this is not a constructive user screaming harassment instantly when something is corrected is simply trolling it is entirely possible this user is intentionally making bad edits 
 ckatz thank you for the pointers to the background on this user we certainly dont need this kind of disruption on the wikt and it is good to forestall it (
 i would also point out that the individual wasnt aggressively picked on here the individual is capable of making reasonable content additions but they are apparently incapable of taking any level of criticism of their additions constructive or otherwise and their response to even good faith suggestions about improvement of their edits tends to degenerate into juvenile trolling i unblocked the editor at one point to allow them to continue editing after they had been indefinitely blocked i would not do that again the level of disruption greatly outweighs the quality of the content they add 
 see my talk page on enwikt for an amusing post from the troll 
 see if there is any remaining doubt 
 why did you undo the scrubs episode list talk page archive i clearly indicated where the earlier debate was and to say that it is ongoing is wishful thinking i find this action disruptive and slightly pointy since talk pages are archived from time to time when they get too long this is not some backdoor attempt to stifle debate i am going to redo the archive and if you wish to reconsider the archiving please raise it on the talk page where consensus can coalesce to support your unusual actions actually i will raise it myself and invite comment 
 k thats better i thought you were supposed to be all laid back and stuff out there in bc we are the ones under N cm of goddamn snow 
 sorry but its not disruptive i really dont think it is appropriate to archive the discussion at this time the older material yes but not the more current material 
 i took the liberty of putting the notation templates for 
 great idea thanks can you do that same with 
 sure 
 thank you very much 
 i should say that i dont consider this article particularly bad its just that the other featured planetary articles are far longer and have more citations so i thought as the featured topic nears completion it would be a good idea to revisit the old articles and see if they need any work 
 hiya there has been a decent amount of discussion on the 
 thank you for deleting 
 its an ip and i took it as simply vandalism which i have deleted again you sure you want to go afd 
 the standard convention in astronomy is that the milky way galaxy is a proper noun whether milky way is explicitly stated or not generically any old galaxy is a common noun im happy with the punctuation on 
 a fyi galaxy a system of about N billion stars our sun is a member of the milky way galaxy which is sometimes just designated by capitalization galaxy there are billions of galaxies in the observable universe exactly when and how galaxies formed in the universe is a topic of current astronomical research 
 again you reverted saying no torrent sites torrentfreakcom is not a torrent site its a news site focussing on pN p and torrent news but its moot as i found a more mainstream source http or or wwwbuddytvcom or articles or jericho or jericho_first_three_season_twoN aspx as 
 hey pal hope your life is okay my email is relatively active if you need me 
 im glad to hear everything is okay and i hope it remains so look after yourself and if you do ever need to talk you know where i am i have just scored quite a few back issues of tcj so let me know what creators you are working on just stumbled upon a small obit of 
 the obit has a photo actually if and when i ever get a scanner that works with my new system or my old computer which works with my old scanner i will scan it in i think we can use nonfree images of deceased people 
 curiously the journal give his year of birth as N and age at death N accordingly 
 i appreciate your letting me know what happened i figured it was probably accidental since you seem to be very clear in your edit summaries but its nice to know 
 by the way i have moved on to adding nrhp and nhl information to 
 done ingham does need to be updated to the latest ship infobox but its one of about a gazillion articles that need that im working through submarines now but im sure ingham will get updated by someone eventually 
 welcome back i have fixed and added a lot of content on the 
 have you had a chance to check this out 
 thats cool its a handy reference with links to a bunch of older characters so i figured maybe you could make use of it 
 you ever visit 
 theres a reg there with the same screenname thats all hes usually got some thought out positions its not an uncommon word so i didnt particularly assume it was you but thought it might be laters hope all is well 
 thanks for fixing my mistake with my signature 
 no problem i have forgotten before and i always appreciated it when someone did the same for me 
 np 
 first is this edit by you im asking here first because i respect you and id rather be upfront than go to 
 hey i thought about saying something myself but im glad hiding did it first because he probably knows you a lot better than i do truth be told it seems to be that asgardian has gotten a lot better in recent months i have seen him less likely to edit war and he will discuss things with people more than he used to so there is definite improvement to be frank i didnt like him very much when i first started getting involved with the comics project but over time i have come to appreciate him more take a backseat look at him and keep an objective eye on him while others deal with him maybe you will see where im coming from and maybe you wont i dont want to see you tripping yourself up over your personal feelings towards someone you have had a longstanding conflict with i know how that can be 
 thanks for understanding i think it would be best if you stick to the facts and ignore any condescending comments or if they bother you simply post that you have been called condescending to the 
 western_australian_prohibition_referendum_N the numbers are not showing in the table 
 correct the figures arent available online so its on my list of things to do to fill it out i actually want to get the daylight savings and secession ones sorted first though 
 thanks it was the best i could find there are two images of finger on the net but neither give any source or copyright holder details and one of them is i think the basis for robinsons portrait the two other images are at image alone at which i think is the inspiration for robinsons and looks to be from a newspaper or book judging by the yellowed paper and one at both and was probably sourced from there by image alone they are both pretty poor images and the robinson one although not a photo probably works best 
 theres a photo of finger playing golf in daniels N years of the worlds greatest heroes but i dont have a scanner and again theres no copyright holder listed 
 trivially easy to do and awesome thanks so much they absolutely should incorporate this into the watchlist

 i have spend huge amount of hours reading newspapers books and maps bloody drive me in sane when you go on a wild goose chase but come home empty handed 
 well i did not find any information on a un on the page but i did find a us at the bottom which is more than good enough for me thank you for pointing this out 
 thanks for the backup on a un much appreciated 
 hey tenebrae i think the gent who is adding the info about the shirley booth bio really is trying to be helpful rather than blowing his own horn i edited his contrib so it doesnt stick out as much later 
 i guess i am too trusting good job digging into this now if we can just get this dude to stop reverting your reverts 
 we both might have to eat our words tenebrae i found the listing for the book at the bearmanor website i thought that pubisher sounded familiar they publish a lot of books on old film and tv stars i have books published by them on 
 i bow to your superior wikiknowledge for what its worth tedkeyN is working himself up in a lather on his talkpage its obvious hes a nN b and you might want to visit his talk page with the points you have made to me otherwise hes just going to keep reverting your reverts thanks for your explanations 
 ted keyN is not giving up without a fight he posted a rather arrogant response on my talk page i responded on his and probably not as diplomatically as i should have i also reverted his nth reversion at 
 thanks for your kind words i was a disappointed with myself for loosing it with tedkeyN however much he may have deserved it im just glad i found a compromise that i hope will stop this knucklehead from screwing up the article 
 your hook is ready interesting article by the way 
 i dont know im new to dyk so i have just been reviewing articles im going to wait until someone else moves it to the prep area because im scared to do it i can give you an idea though when my dyk was approved it took two days to appear on the main page 
 go right ahead whatever you feel is appropriate 
 you removed an external link from the article 
 hey ckatz i know your work on wikipedia very well but in the fairness of neutrality i just want to point out that on the article 
 no problem and i appreciate the note im also trying to avoid an edit war as that article has had enough battles in the past with deys accordingly i have proposed what i feel is a possible solution at the talk page please let me know what you think thanks again 
 hi ckatz sorry for not replying you soon there seemed a bit misunderstanding here please look at my and check what links here for each image you will see that i only deleted orphan fairuse images which did no harm to the illustration of articles if the image is found in use i am willing to restore it hope this address your concern cheers 
 i have restored all images the rest is up to you cheers 
 hello ckatz i wonder about consensus when wikipedia also provides the following guidance votes are not necessarily binding have i misread something a couple of anonymous ips an alumnus and cyrill represent a consensus do they i can get ten times that number if i asked my friends to join then what 
 senior editors should answer questions or refer people who want to know to the right place lets act on principle i want to know if ranking mba programmes or any programme constitutes a comercial activity it seems like marketing to me how about you consensus will always go in favour of selfinterested cliques like alumni are when they subvert a generalknowledge wikipedia page into a marketing arm for an institution 
 editors may give my contributions less weight you have written on my page why would they bother to check where else i have posted why would they not simply deal with any contribution on its own merits i posted on other mba sites and have stated my purpose to ameliorate the rankings on them you edit the heroes page and plenty of others i see so you do get wikirespect from me however it does mean you can wikiignore answering this question is it correct to have these rankings on wikipedia 
 my history of edits does not indicate a proanything position others on that schulich page have selfish agendas after over a year of reading the squabbling on that page i feel comfortable enough to use have instead of seem to have incidentally when i accuse someone of conflict of interest all i am doing is repeat wht they have written themselves dtorgerson is an alumnus who posts on his own schools page and there is plenty of money tied up with it his admission alone and or or his proschulich history of edits should raise eyebrows please answer this question too is it ok to post on ones own school page and tell everyone that you are an alumnus keeping in mind the money thats at stake it is naive and provocative at best even if you answer yes 
 what a relief to see you editing at reasonable hours at times i worry you might have hit my oldest teenagers lifestyle 
 my hours have finally gotten back to normal as of this morning 
 yeah the bloody graveyard hounds are let off at daybreak and bay down the valley to give me extra hours on the computer 
 per a conversation i had with another editor on 
 you should be able to recreate a page at 
 actually that works too i was just under the mindset that undeleting a page is the best way of going at it but whatever i will recreate it though id like for you to tell me if redirects should be utilised also any ideas for the descriptions 
 you really dont have anything 
 i just remembered that 
 there is no need to await a response from me over the content as opposed to the form i dont know dragon ball use the talk pages of the pages you have ideas for 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised removing will stop the 
 im all for keeping the band article obviously but i have also worked to remove promotional material that has been added to the page by another editor i am more than willing to discuss this on the articles talk page though i really havent added much other than the basic information so if you would be willing to remove it and inform the editor im willing to work out a compromise 
 thanks for leaving the message if you think the article should stay then you are more than welcome to remove the prod template and i do appreciate that you have worked to remove a lot of the promotional sounding material that said im not sure the band would meet 
 easy or not its unnecessary to cite uncontroversial public information the way bravo reruns that show they have been spashing those names up on the television screen fifty times a week removing it and demanding sourcing is just silly and was certainly never the intent of wpblp 
 and seriously who is this mystery admin that you think is going to intervene in a content dispute im an admin and i clearly dont agree with you you probably can find some that will but many others will not you shouldnt be invoking mystery admin authority to shore up your weak argument 
 have you actually seen the show that you are edit warring on as i said the information in question is presented on the show both stated by the individuals and also printed on screen in caption boxes 
 seriously you are lecturing me about invoking admin status to influence a content dispute when you are the one who keeps saying an admin would agree with me im only mentioning that im an admin to show what a silly argument that is oh and feel free to bring this up at ani if you feel it is merited 
 now i dont even know what you are talking about its verifiable by watching the show a source doesnt need to be available on the internet in order to be valid 
 international availability to the masses is not now and has never been a requirement for sourcing 
 again its verifiable by watching the show the availability of the show is not relevant as to its value as a source and no i dont think such a disclaimer is a good idea N because its not accurate N because its a disclaimer if you really insist on continuing to unnecessarily cite uncontroversial public information i note that bravo credits all of the chefs by the full name when it puts their recipes on their website
 sure other peopl need to be able to check the information but that doesnt mean that everybody has to have instant access to it yes a television show is more difficult to check than a web article but that doesnt affect its validity as a source 
 are you the creator of the useless tag 
 thank you for the response mystery solved it is quite popular now 
 hello ckatz how are you today i was wondering if you can explain your reason behind your edit of the heroes page external links section i have read and reread wpel and have found no evidence that proves my contribution to the el section was inappropriate of course i may be wrong on this subject i was under the impression that wikipedia was supposed to give to an international scope on the series and since nbc is not the only network that shows heroes i was under the impression that it was okay to link to other official sites for other networks which aired the show my reasoning for making the edit was moduled after the lost pageas you know i love the lost page lost is a featured article and i was attempting to emulate them anyway if you have some time please respond i will add your talkpage to my watch list until you respond so feel free to respond here or come to my talkpagewhatever you prefer like i said you may be right on this subject as you are more experienced than i i would just like to know your reasoning and discuss it with you also if you are right then is the lost page wrong in having a similar external links section like the one i created 
 just wanted to chime in here i also dont know of anything in 
 thanks for adding on to my pointthat is kinda exactly what i was trying to say but i said it in too many words yeah lost is fa and had a similar if not exact el section as to the one i made when they got upgraded to featured article thoughts 
 also i noticed on a lot of pages about books and novels the external links section has links to all the different official publishers from around the globe 
 thanks for the message i will let you know if anything untoward happens well done for unmasking that his pet project isnt an official wikiproject i had a good look and was thinking it didnt look right 
 even if 
 these are just some of the reasons for avoiding excessive lists yes lost may well have such lists and im sure you could present other examples that doesnt mean it is the best solution however and there are certainly examples of longestablished highly respected television articles that do not do this (for example 
 thanks very much for explainingi understand nowi just needed some clarityyour explanations make sense to memaybe the lost article should be reassessed for fa status because that page has a lot of little errors that should not be listed in a fa article also are you an admin you have a lot of knowledge on wp policyyou should really go for admin status if you are not 
 well said ckatz i think those are some very good reasons 
 let me ask you a question lets say that a year from now bravo removes the recipes from their website would that then mean that you would against start edit warring to remove the last names of these people because it was no longer instantly verifiable information 
 im not sure why you think this is personal i think that your understanding of policy is incorrect and i was having a discussion with you about it im sorry that upsets you you didnt really respond to my question so i will assume that you arent interested in having this discussion im not campaigning for unsourced information i advocate common sense something which i often find is sorely lacking here on wikipedia policy exist for a purpose improving the encyclopedia not for its own sake 
 yes i know what it says i was asking what you would do im not even sure what bad faith assumption you think i have made at no point did i think that you were editing in bad faith simply misguided good faith i guess i apologize but again i dont know what you are talking about okay maybe the common sense crack was a bit snarky and i certainly apologize for that but your removal of the information to me certainly defies logic to me i really do not comprehend why you think that a source cannot be used unless everybody the world over can access it that doesnt comform to my understanding of our policies regarding sources i think you are wrong you think im wrong i love arguing about policy but as the issue is settled theres no real reason to if you dont want to as you say no hard feelings 
 have fun 
 sorry for the delay the links were repeatedly restored despite cautions and notification that they were not suitable 
 as one of the few regular watchers of the 
 thanks very much for the input i will add mythical civilizations to the outline right now i will add axial age to the history section or do you think it would better belong in the theories section its more a theory about a specific period in the history of civilization than a theory about the nature of civilization itself and one of the main things im trying to do is separate facts from the big spectrum of theories currently its all comingled in a very confusing fashion anyway thank you very much for your help 
 i read the qualifications and nominations process pretty throughly and did not see anything negative about asking for support i only asked those N guys since i have had interactions with them in the past they know a bit about my history etc mom always said dont expect help if you dont ask for it i will take your suggestions under advisment thanks again 
 got really busy over the past few days at work i dont have the time to fight for adminship right now and i think you may be right i should gain a bit more experience i realized this as i was going to withdraw and discovered i dont know how to withdraw ha so since you offered any idea how to do this 
 i came across your name while looking for good administrator candidates i notice you have been asked here a couple times but never confirmed any interest now you appear to be quite qualified uN 
 sure take whatever time you need i wont do anything further unless i hear from you uN 
 come now lets get this show on the road already and #N 
 just a note the indent in the cast section for ferrigno is based on the fact he has a minor part but its shared with the star of the film the section is so prosy bullets are inappropriate but check out examples at 
 thank you for making me chortle with comment uN 
 im not sure but it also looks like the edit you made left the infobox taking up more than half the page can you check on that when you redo thanks 
 thanks for the note i will rerun awb when i get a chance i also took a look at the page and the problems with the reference section seem to originate with the ip edits just following where you reverted to the ips removed a few brackets from the ref and cite coding that messed things up cheers 
 please give me a minute i undid your revision to add references for the content in the article just wait a second while i add them 
 i have started a topic on the talk page 
 what i have been editing is the wikilink that khan gets piped to just make sure that the link doesnt go to khan because that will get changed there is no article for khan if someone keeps changing that back to point to khan that could be causing the problem i will check it by hand now and make sure it points correctly 
 i just checked and it was pointing to khan again i fixed it theres no problem with the display text khan is just fine but it cant be wikilinked to that word if there is any further problem just let me know 
 just occurred to me that there might be a massive misunderstanding and what i did would be very irritating i really didnt mean it that way when you said that i had been changing khan to upper case i realized that you didnt understand because i never changed the word to upper case as is evident from the history all i changed was the piping ok so i will do what i should have done before and mdashi will take the piping out and put a disambiguation tag on the word allowing you to pipe it wherever you want i have also put a message explaining the issue on the 
 hey jc tried to join the rfc you posted in may and found the link outdated i tracked down the relevant page and it looks like discussion was concluded last month dont know specifically this is so but i didnt want to do cleanup maintenance on that noticeboard item without checking with you first 
 hope this helps 
 i noticed that you modified a recent edit of the 
 fair enough any thoughts about how we might rework the line to include we and still make it a bit more formal (part of why i removed it was because i thought we know 
 im just hoping for some sort of consensus to emerge from the talk page everybody seems to have their own opinion on the matter so im not sure what would be best and mdash 
 so what am i meant to do pepper the with my comments and disagreement or concessions or wait for someone else to let me know whats what is this for us to thrash out any disagreement away from the vertigo talk page or for someone to arbitrate and tell either or both of us who had the right of it im all confused 
 jcN wanted a summary of what this disagreement is all about so i have written a take on it all from my perspective but thought it would be courteous to run it past you first o i dont want to attack you since as you say this has all been pretty civil but i want to try and explain why i think you were wrong over some issues would you care to see my likely horribly subjective thoughts prior to my forwarding them to jcN or would you like to synthesise an impartial summary or would you prefer to put down your side of things or 
 that written this continues to be a great debate perhaps even an important one but really if its in any way impacting on personal issues its done o 
 let me know if theres anything i can add like the notice above says you can transclude the page to 
 off to a nice start keep your eye out for additional questions uN 
 hello ckatz personally id rather that quebecois motion be removed from the introduction but i will go along with it in order to avoid edit wars 
 sorry but wikipedia is not for advertising and self promotion posting links to your own site violates 
 please stop restoring the links they fail wikipedias 
 by all means please do not contribute we would prefer that spammers whose sole interest in contributing here is to promote themselves and their websites get lost it makes the mess easier to clean up after you leave and #N 
 and quite honestly you have been explained over and over again why your links are being removed theres nothing undefined about it you are violating 
 does that make sense 
 please note i havent changed anything in 
 i assume you are suggesting its original research to label action #N as the first golden gl #N as a likely first bronze and watchmen as an integral or early or first dark age comic is it a lack of footnotes that made you make those decisions or something more pedestrian 
 i am aware that the ip address is likely from something large but correct this ip also posted in the same exact thread agreeing with you on the jk rowling i assume you made both comments if you are going to comment in the same thread make sure to sign in 
 hey thanks you really spruced that one up with the images and the publication history 
 thanks i will admit that i too often feel a pang of dread when i see that i have a new message but more often than not its good news or someone just dropping a friendly note 
 i have created the article on my sandbox and was wondering if youd be so kind as to give it a look and let me know what you think all the best 
 thanks for the advice tenebrae i have made some changes and chopped out a lot of the stuff you described as chest puffing and rewrote portions of the history trying to make every word count as you suggested i think i just may be having trouble understanding exactly what makes something notable by wikipedia standards and i thought perhaps some of that stuff may make it more notable making it wikiworthy 
 so you think its wikiworthy as it stands now or does it need more still if you think its notable enough to stand as an article would you mind posting it for me i think an admin posting the article might give it a little more clout and people wouldnt be so quick to tag it for speedy deletion there are a lot of wiki users whose only contributions it seems are to reverse peoples edits and tag articles for speedy deletion instead of helping to clean up the article all the best 
 i was coming here to see why you arent an admin yet and came across someone vandalising your userpage i see you are making all sorts of fun friends heh 
 yeah its been awhile i have sort of disappeared from wikipedia over the last while i had to take time off in my final two semesters but now i graduated and have been on tour im thinking of making a return to wikipedia but i havent thought about an area im interested in writing about maybe literature 
 good catch as i hinted at some while back i have picked up a good few more tcjs from around that time one of which has a transcription of a stanspeech as well as comments from shooter and marvel certainly goes some way to providing some balance since most of the actualy reportage is naturally biased towards kirby likewise the verymany letters from fans pros and companies almost entirely side with him so while they add insight and context im sidetracking down fandomroutes at the moment but when i have a better chance to absorb all the kirby relevant materials that will be next and the lawyers name may well help somewhat thanks 
 in a couple of weeks im either going to have quite a bit more time to be able to devote to wikipedia or very little indeed but hopefully there will be kirbytime before during or after that i certainly should get round to compiling or digitising my tcj and c source materials soon 
 for the mediation committee 
 excuse me ckatz but could you please restore my tags to the government and politics section of the 
 i see that you wont oblige this request cheers 
 with all due respect it is hardly fair to make such a statement just because i was not able to respond instantly as to your tags there was no need to add four additional templates to the section especially with an edit comment such as well lets go all out then shall we soulscanner had added the disputed tag to which you added cleanupsection copyedit repetition and misleading at the most you should have added one tag the cleanupsection template the others are repetitive copyedit and repetition are already covered by cleanup while misleading is addressed through the existing disputed tag the edit war you and soulscanner are involved in is disruptive enough and im not favouring either side the simple fact is that the extra templates did not help so they were removed 
 i appreciate your assistance on this one when i started editing the article i really didnt think it would get to ths level passion for the characters is a fine thing but as you always said the wikistandards are there for a reason so it doesnt become a case of aladdin and the N fan pages the buildup to the avengers film is only going to spark more of these debates but i suppose thats part of the fun 
 yep aint it fun when we agree 
 btw whats wpc mos and where or when was it decided that we dont use volume indicators why is this and how do we distinguish between different volumes of series when mentioning issue numbers 
 thanks and yeah i do wanna learn intellectual curiosity and a desire to know all the pertinent guidelines has always been a part of my mo btw i notice that you had almost N edits under your belt but theres not administrator insignia on your user page are you not an admin are you not interested in becoming one has no one ever nominated you before 
 thanks 
 no worries just have to figure out a way to do it now my short template looks very clinical and artificial 
 congratulations i have just closed your rfa as successful and made you an administrator take a look at the 
 thank you very much and thanks for the new admin school tip that will help with the learning curve cheers 
 congratulations 
 yes congrats dont delete the main page but its ok to block jimbo a few times 
 congratulations long overdue uN 
 and im not done yet one down etc etc hopefully i can get to a couple more of the fifty before i become too otherwisely busy thanks though o 
 that said of course other things have intervened plus it occurs to me that this N some year old print source would also be described as a selfserving borderlineselfpublished pamphlet is it then allowable as a citable source 
 if nothing else its a very enlightening philosophical conundrum with no easy answers and contrary opinions on all sides 
 surely rather than ignoring differences of interpretation or opinion we should all attempt to firstly understand them and then secondly try to change those we see as being wrong or flawed through debate and areason since im still trying to be polite i will do you the courtesy of withholding my final query since you likely wont address it and it might therefore seem rude on its own 
 see reply 
 the links are not being used as references they are being spammed across many pages most recently by singlepurpose ips which appear to be in use by the same person or persons furthermore this is not the first time this url has been involved in questionable postings problems date back to at least march of N when 
 please read through the 
 sorry but we will have to discuss this through the talk page as im not on a chat service as for your concerns im not sure how much more helpful one can get i have explained the guideline regarding external links i have given you a link to that page as well as to previous concerns regarding the url and i have held off on other measures despite repeated reverts 
 should 
 wow thats bizarre o_o im glad i didnt be bold in this case 
 i hope your recent absence doesnt bode too ill and trust that things are as well as can be expected with you personally continuing a trend i have been attempting to locate the glaring gaps here in comics history with a view to addressing them i have managed to get hold of some pretty helpful sources particularly for jack liebowitz and jack schiff which i hope to cobble together soon both of which might interest you meantime do you have a couple of moments to cast a quick eye over 
 i missed a signing and talk by blake bell by N hours which was a shame i have heard good things about his book though i have been unable to find a decent judgement of how much it is history biography or bibliography though 
 i will see if i can turn up any more on mr sahle but that seems pretty solid next up i hope to transfer all my notes on liebowitz and schiff onto the computer 
 spillane knew sahle 
 i should be able to work the above in and then you can hone it as and when hope your work at least is going smoothly 
 computer failure just ate several hoursworth of sahle edits but i think i can dig some of out of the memory if it winds up looking a bit awkward i blame the computer and lack of sleep incidentally says that there should be will be may have been an article on sahle in alter ego i will keep my eyes peeled 
 i believe your removal of the csd from 
 unfortunately the remainder of my comment was cut off a simple search in english found N hits on boulaich obviously not all will be useful but several of the hits are sufficient to establish that a speedy deletion is in fact inappropriate beyond that i would ask that you assume good faith on the part of your fellow editors and avoid making unwarranted threats suggestions that this action in any way warrants an an or i report note that the speedy deletion policy explicitly states that deletion is not required if a page meets these criteria and any editor who is not the creator of a page may remove a speedy tag from it speedies are a arequest for deletion not a directive as an administrator im expected to assess your request determine if it is warranted and act accordingly as an editor im entitled to disagree with your opinion 
 the ani comment was not a threat thereuN s a distinct difference between uN cifuN d and uN cwilluN d indicating that i would be honorable and notify you if that is my decision was an extension of courtesy the comment was made in good faith and it would appear that you need to read not only csd but agf 
 out of respect for your reply i have changed threat to suggestion however that doesnt change my underlying concern that you would consider this as being even remotely worthy of an an or i report those are generally reserved for serious issues not minor disagreements over content 
 there is a secondary issue of judgment you are a relatively new admin exercising in my opinion questionable judgment ani would be an appropriate forum to confirm or deny and thus nip potential future problems in the proverbial bud 
 to quote another editor the fact that theres a keep vote here already indicates to me that it would have been inappropriate to speedily delete the article speedy deletion is only for those cases that are so obvious that there is no need to waste everyones time with a debate (this is from the 
 thanks for the note unfortunately the links dont meet 
 with all due respect your links do not meet the requirements however we cannot disrupt the page over the links section so i have followed standard practice as per the 
 in this instance of course the information in the article is preserved so its only a theoretical debate and easily left to one side i do think it important to note that quality as a whole shut down only six months after candy however since it might imply that the demise of the comic was not necessarily tied to the rumored or alleged or possible death of sahle nor automatically something as simple as falling sales but could have been behindthescenes difficulties with the company itself and on the unknownbutguessed death year you are probably right to cut my wafflely around ten years later but i felt it better to hedge that as i suspect ware or bails guessed at the date themselves based in large part on the lack of new material hence it could be a year earlier than N or any time beyond that maybe even the midN s of one of the more likely sahles in the ssdi incidentally did you look at the cbg forum link as of this time two years ago roy thomas was or was expected to be in contact with a relative of sahle for a writeup in alter ego if that occurred dates might be findable if not there may yet be a piece coming sometime soon hope things are as well as can be with you 
 i like parentheses and in particular felt that reprints appearing after his main body of work did was both reasonably obvious and therefore a complete aside and thus parenthetical but it doesnt make much difference readabilitywise talking of readability i see that i have been gazzumped on 
 status quo is something at least its not a nice position to be in and im useless at the best of times in offering the right words of support empathy etc but whatever the right thoughts or phrases are at the moment they are what im trying to express stay positive 
 hey there gwynand i think this might be the first time im on your talkpage im writing here for your consideration after perusing philosophers contributions to wikipedia his talkpages his archives etc i came to the conclusion that he would make a fine admin i always do that before i read any of the current support or oppose votes to avoid being swayed or biased by rfa my next step before i lend my support or oppose i do take a quick gander at whos landing where and more importantly why the third and last thing i check before casting my opinion is the questions and the answers to the questions why do i do things in this order with the questions or answers having the least bearing two reasons #N its way to easy to answer questions correctly when you are in the spotlight known as rfa every candidate is on their best behavior simple stump speeches and campaign promises i get a much better feel for someone by literally disregarding the questions or answers unless there is something so blatantly wrong with an answer as to cause me to hesitate and dig further into the candidate reason #N its way to easy for a questioner to stump a candidate with either a loaded question a question that requires an opinion in the answer or somehow otherwise trap a candidate into answering incorrectly i very much appreciate the agf challenge and very much respect userfilll for presenting it to the community as i feel that those scenarios in their intricacies are challenging in every sense of the word i very much disagree that they are appropriate for an admin candidate however or even an admin with several months experience they are in my opinion better exercises for the most seasoned of admins that have been to the trenches and dark dark corners of adminship and have come out the other side relatively unharmed unretired with battle scars of glory to prove their merits not admin candidates though i agree with you in this sense that philosopher in some ways botched his answer but you have to realize he was doomed to fail before he even hit edit this section im hoping that you will change your opinion of philosophers qualifications at the same time i respect your opinion and beyond hoping i have no expectations that you will do so nor will i hold illwill towards you if you dont regardless of how you receive this note im hoping you will look at a broader picture of this particular editor who is likely feeling quite blindsided probably downtrodden and perhaps even unappreciated and at the very least iof you could dig deeper into his merits and contributions to this ridiculous website beyond qN to see if he is in fact a viable candidate cheers gwynand thanks in advance 
 all that to say gwynand was extremely classy in my opinion regardless of anything else i have ranted on about here extremely classy 
 what it comes down to for me is its always easier to promote in a few months then to desysop ever there are soooo many candidates flying through rfas who are near perfect they go through with N N per cent pass rates and as i have said before this is great these are the candidates we want as for the ones that have a few stumbles does it definitely mean they get my oppose no but if it really concerns me i probably will oppose or comment in neutral i hold candidates to high standards of judgement above any other criteria i also think making them wait just a few more months to let the community gain a deeper confidence and for them to gain more experience can be whats best for the community in the long run 
 thanks gwynand and i will say again as i linked above very classy move in conjunction with naerii the only thing i would have you consider in your response is the statement that it is totally harmless to makea candidate wait while i agree with that in theory for a candidate that isnt ready and have voted as much in the past i dont agree with that when a candidate is ready obviously i feel this candidate is ready he botched a loaded question and has garnered opposition for it outside of the one edit that he made in his own rfa this particular editor has done it right and done it well at least as far as my research into contribs tells me so whats the harm in making him wait what if he leaves 
 although you seem to be doing a fine job overall just thought id say could you be a little more careful with your reverts see or for a couple of examples thanks 
 thanks for the note unfortunately those articles were vandalized by 
 okay will do by the way judging by the types of edits by the user i think the user name is short for 
 hi the discussion aside did a redirect from infobox planet to infobox nonstellar body not work seemed to be okay here 
 well im still here trying to iron out a few wrinkles in the template how about leaving it as nonstellar body and see if anyone objects with reason beyond the principle of having a discussion unless you already see a problem with the name or have a potentially better one 
 the name shouldnt have any effect on the tweaks okay if a discussion there must be then i guess the templates talk page is the place to start it so i have i see though that there hasnt been much talk there recently 
 okay i was assuming that whatever the outcome the redirection could handle it after all suggesting via the infobox name that 
 if you do not want this userright you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time 
 btw i loved that tag on your userpage so much im going to have to steal it 
 times like this i wish i hadnt voluntarily given back the mop and bucket i have been editing this site on and off virtually since its inception and i have never seen a character quite like that connor guy i am genuinely creeped out by this user and i am beyond grateful you have blocked him please take a look at his photo contribs they are simply useless thank you from the bottom of my heart for shutting him down if even for a few days 
 id walked away due to some nasty abuse i was receiving based on the deletions of nonsense one guy blew a gasket and tried to run me up on a rfc after i deleted his nonsense dicdefwhich has stayed deleted same thing happened once before id given back the mop and bucket on a prior occasion wrote jimbo some months later to ask to be reinstated which i was only to have much the same thing happen again once administrative blood hits the water the trolls go into a feeding frenzy and the community kind of sat back and watched this last time really was the last time i requested and received deadminning once more under my old username of lucky N and walked away for almost two years i wanted to return and do some work on veropedia but the only way to do that was to edit here so here i am im having more fun cleaning up old articles and doing some whackavandal patrolling 
 just found your reedit of my restoration of the deleted passage concerning the doctor and the declaration of independence in 
 thesportsinterview links have been repeatedly spammed across a series of articles for over a year now and the url was even on the spam list for a period of time a host of singlepurpose ips have surfaced their only goal being to add links to this site to articles the external links guideline does not condone adding links just because an interview exists otherwise we would have hundreds of links on these pages you have been advised of this repeatedly please respect the site guidelines 
 you are welcome to seek a second opinion but to be perfectly honest you are in all likelihood going to get exactly the same response wikipedia does not exist as a directory for links furthermore the fact that your links were up for a year does not indicate that they should have been placed to begin with there are well over two million articles on wikipedia so it does take time to clean up problems you are not the first site owner to question why his or her links are being removed many many people have done the same thing because they do not see the difference between wikipedia and other web sites i have said this before but i will say it again do not take it as a comment on your site merely the reality that the links are not suitable for this project 
 actually asgardian is doing very little in attempting to convince me as he ignores the vast majority of the posts on his and on the bb talk page in which i respond to his arguments by explaining why i do not agree with them and cite policy that instructs us to favor outuniverse instead of inuniverse three times for example have i pointed to why the criteria for failing 
 for example asgardian likely knew full well that tenebrae answered my request for intervention about the thanos or galactus mess with that _his mother was dying_ so i responded that i couldnxbN t in good conscience ask him to bother with our crap and rather take any time he can to spend with her but if he knew some other reliable editor preferably fanatic about factual accuracy that would be appreciated yet asgardian still asks him to intervene it could be a mistake but also a deceitful xbN letxbN s keep up appearances by asking someone i know doesnxbN t have the time to intervene and then insert anything i feel like on blatantly false xbN povxbN claims as usualxbN itxbN s the sort of person my sum of experiences have read him as 
 i was aware this behavior of his predates my encounters with him but i was unaware that he had used sockpuppets you say that he claimed this was the work of a hacker and that this was a lie how would a hacker cause a sock puppet to be attributed to him and how do you know this was a lie was there an ip check or something 
 thanks for your response tenebrae yes most of his edits are quite valid in the regard that you mention and i havent hesitated from praising him for this making sure to couch my criticisms of him in this point but there is a distinction between those edits and the ones he makes that do not fall into this category including the specific ones mentioned in the discussion i directed you to and i would have preferred you opining on them if you dont want to slog through the entire thread you can simply read the few posts by me in which i specifically list the particulars and respond to those of mine seems to sum it up you can also check out my responses to asgardian wherein i responded to his rebuttals to get a lay of the land so to speak thanks 
 andrew per the comments that have been left on your talk page at least three editors other than myself have reviewed your site and felt that it did not meet the external links guideline this doesnt mean your site is bad but wikipedia is not a links directory or a search engine we dont link to every site with content the project works on based on consensus and the consensus so far has been that your links dont belong please see my note on your talk page as well 
 first what specific problems were there with the site if there is any way i could fix them id like to know how second should i just leave some talk on all of those pages with the assumption that someone else may read follow the link and repost sorry if you think this is spam but it is a great site that i worked very hard to make for the benefit of others and it seems rather unfortunate that it would be rejected from the entire wp community by three people 
 i guess i have been persistent with these links because i am certain my site is a better resource than several other external links that appear on these pages also i wonder why links to sparknotes and other painfully commercial sites appear on these pages also while some editors did criticize these links months ago i made many changes to the site based on their comments please clarify 
 it is understandable that you would feel strongly about your site and it is also commendable that you are trying to adapt it based on comments from others however one key problem lies in you being the one to add links to the site since there is an obvious 
 one point to consider the message you are currently posting is too promotional in nature and may well cause additional problems i would suggest you remove the old text and reword it to briefly describe the site and its features in simple hypefree text most importantly be sure to mention your role the fact it was deemed unsuitable previously and that you have reworked it on the basis of comments received here that way there is nothing hidden you avoid the hey look at this great site spam messaging that is discouraged here and you put everything out there for editors to assess again you may or may not be successful and it would probably be casebycase hope this helps 
 i have listed this at ifd since there seems to be some doubt about whether this is indeed 
 thanks very much for clearing that up the ifd is at 
 thank you and please feel welcome to continue contributing to wikipedia happy editing 
 i will track this back and see where it actually entered in case the article is not deleted i will take care of attribution however if there are other articles into which you have copied material from other articles even if it was a long time ago please make sure that they have proper attribution in order to comply with 
 more urgently please be sure that any other content you have copied from other wikipedians is fully attributed 
 i dont know i work copyright not airfields i would have to research it myself to form an opinion the question of course is whether or not it is widely covered by 
 i think the ip addy that continues to revert back the unsourced information is actually 
 yeah its probably better if you dont protect the page given your most recent revert of the same information an admin decline it on the grounds that there hasnt been enough recent activity and i dont want to continue the edit war with this ip who seems to blindly revert back without providing any source and blanking their talk page when i ask them for one 
 i think i was right about the ip being joey they both just blanked their talk pages backtoback 
 further to this remember that on wikipedia an administrator is just an editor with some extra tools to assist in enforcing policies and guidelines established by all editors your actions and the ips actions contravened a longestablished requirement for verifiability and as such can be removed when discovered while editors are encouraged to discuss the matter as bignole did by posting on the respective talk pages it would be inappropriate to allow unreferenced material to remain until said discussion is complete 
 take a look at 
 it is N km from the coast N km south of tantura swp ii N and N no population in modern times as far as i can tell including now 
 ah thanks also do you have the pop numbers for N for 
 please check your email 
 hello there what do you make of 
 left the impression that at the very least or pretty much 
 i have come across a user (
 thanks for the input but it looks like this guy was just bound and determined to torpedo himself i have never seen a user try harder to ruin their own argument well we tried thanks a million 
 this one is interesting only if you have the time http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlegalactus and oldidN 
 nice double team on 
 wikipedia articles should use reliable thirdparty published sources wikipedia articles should be based around reliable secondary sources this means that while primary or tertiary sources can be used to support specific statements the bulk of the article should rely on secondary sources if you want to head over to an or i and argue that core policy is wrong best of luck to you 
 hmmmtad tightly wound perhaps well he cant ignore the discussion started and is only one user what are your thoughts 
 why did you undo my edits commenting about the story from a realworld context the idea that it was only later described as a supersoldier serum that appeared previously was a false one and this explains the story from an outofuniverse context apart from the fictional character biography much of which ought to be reinstated also you removed the heroes reborn link without placing it somewhere else 
 while i inderstand why you did what you did the fact that other than the term super solider no previouslyexisting marvel characters were noted until the second story and the first storys manner of telling are significant but dont belong in the fcb unless you have a good reason for taking them out i would like you to put them back i would do it myself but i dont want them taken out again 
 i said collapsed on the floor because we dont know for sure that he is dead that would be or 
 because i made a typo also violently indicates that it was an instant process not a drowning and dying like that of 
 its certainly possible they said john kowalski appeared in 
 i would alomost say wisconsin is more relevant since its actually mentioned in the stories and omaha was apparently made up for the handbook 
 surturz appears to be up to his old tricks 
 if by old tricks you mean adding 
 agreed my point probably wasnt the same as timeshifts i just thought none of it had anything to do with mr evans and more to do with general government policy at the time which he happened to have the transient job of enforcing i would not be against such a section being added in the right location 
 at least was highly relevant to chris evans oh well now the article implies he has done absolutely nothing in office i guess thats not too far from the truth 
 the bile and hatred is oozing out of surturz for all to see 
 in general though surturz has a point ministers dont tend to do very much that isnt part of the job description he has executed his job somewhat differently to his predecessor but that reflects the fact hes part of a labor government and the labor party have a different policy to the liberal party on this issue the interesting thing though re that may N quote is that several hundred have been accepted since one can say anything on a small sample size 
 just wanted to chime in that i believe your addition of dmoz is the fair and equitable solution to the fan site listings i will help you enforce that if fan site links are added further 
 thanks for the note i have found the dmoz link to be pretty useful so far the sliders page most definitely wasnt an issue by any stretch but there are other pages that have had real problems with external links it seems to address several concerns especially complaints along the lines of why isnt my site here if that one is while still providing easy links to fan pages cheers 
 hello ckatz you reverted my edit on 
 there is still a need to provide proper references and a check of the other pages shows that it wasnt referenced there either please try to provide some as much of the article is unreferenced 
 hi im trying to bring 
 the warnings to rp were a part of a larger issue rather than any specifics about formatting for your question i would suggest going with N january N and then applying 
 but were her edits warranted 
 oh and thanks for answering about the correct formatting is the british version used more than the american way then 
 i listened to 
 thanks for yet another barnstar i believe you have exceeded the quota for the amount of barnstars one can give another editor d imo the thor article has very strict maintainers by comparison im quite loose with how much content i include in film articles they wouldnt even allow a mention of kenneth branagh even though final negotiations is hollywood speak for he probably wont drop out since hes cowriting and designing well hes there now 
 per 
 tenebrae we dont just ignore guidelines whenever we feel like it we should be consistent with all wikipedia rules even if we dont like some of the nonpolicies why you continued to battle after realizing i was right is beyond me if you dislike 
 i dont know about the other services but within cap it is made very clear that cadet staff sergeant is a very distinct and separate grade from regular staff sergeants having a section in that article is fine and that might be a good place to add the cap grade insignia image but it needed a mention separately a cadet staff sergeant is not a staff sergeant is not a military noncommissioned officer is not even in the military 
 but holds a clearly military rank rarely if never otherwise used outside military or paramilitary organisations which is rather a strange thing to do if an organisation likes to consider itself nonmilitary is it not 
 a rose by any other name legally civil air patrol is a civilian group its members are not in the military unless they also happen to be in one of the actual military services the same is true of jrotc by the way while sponsored by the military it isnt part of the military no matter what cap or jrotc wants to call it their use of the grade of cadet staff sergeant is not military it is certainly related to the military it is based upon the military grade but they arent military are there any cadet staff sergeants that actually are part of the military remember these arent staff sergeants they are cadet staff sergeants thats a level of cadet not a level of staff sergeant 
 no most cadets arent actually legally in the military but they wear military uniforms and use military ranks often virtually indistinguishable from those worn and used by people who are in the military the rank is not a completely different rank but the same rank with cadet stuck in front i dont know how the us cadet organisations use it but a cadet staff sergeant in the british cadet forces is not usually addressed as cadet staff sergeant but as staff sergeant or staff just as is his counterpart in the actual army he wears a crown over three chevrons just like a real army staff sergeant within the cadet organisation he is a staff sergeant just as a real staff sergeant is within his organisation this is pure semantics its the same rank from the same source whether it has cadet in front of it or not you cant possibly argue that its a completely different rank 
 thanks you can see all the pics i took this weekend regarding carmine however he was one of my teachers during my sophomore year in art school and in my experience he was a very nice guy i dont recall him ever being grumpy 
 thanks and you are welcome happy holidays 
 the problem with the first sentence in the lead is that yes it explains why kirbys important but it doesnt do so in a straightforward concise fashion its a rather long rambling sentence simply saying he is a comic book artist would establish his basic notablity also listing his major creations off the bat is problematic in my view because as this is a biographical article we should be focusing on his life and noting seminal works and accomplishment in a logical orderly fashion compare to lead sections in 
 on another note do you think we should create a kirby nav template theres a hell of a lot of templates at the bottom of the page that are included because kirby created a certain character 
 theres something else i wanted to bring up that might be hard to consider all of those cover images need to be removed they can only be included if the content of the covers themselves we dont need the covers if all that mentioned is that so and so issue came out because then its replaceable since the same info is conveyed in the prose its the same reason why we remove album cover images from band articles on site a better use of a fairuse media would be to find fairuse images of kirby himself as for his art its better to scan images of specific pages will be highlighted in the article as an example of his work once all the sourcing is done 
 hi thank you when i asked for the move i didnt realize that there are hundreds of pages it seemed to be a pretty good idea but apparently it wasnt so good anyway thank you for fix 
 the section was removed initially because of questions over its notability keep in mind that while the game may have had a fair number of players that does not necessarily mean it warrants inclusion given that the series is now over you may find that a lot of material that is currently in the article ends up being removed by the editors if there is no indication of lasting importance however i have left it in for now after cleaning it up a bit cheers 
 its good work the section may be a bit toodetail oriented i have been taking a short break from working on the kirby article at the moment because i have been working on other things but i might get back to it by the weekend 
 any help o 
 im all over the place too so no worries hope you had a good holiday time and happy new year too 
 hi ckatz im sorry if im continually bothering you with all of these requests but i believe 
 no bother and done 
 N thanks 
 again no problem feel free to ask any time cheers 
 N okay appears to be guidelineshadingtopolicy good to know just for future reference N definitely appreciate it and glad i could provide a learning experience d N and for that thanks again 
 i see that you reverted my change to the 
 if you could respond on the 
 what do you want me to do about it 
 is this better 
 the only problem is that it doesnt show up when i type ~~~~ it says invalid raw signature please check html tags in the bow where i type it in on my preferences instead i have to copy the text of my signature paste it and put ~~~~~ please help 
 thanks for pointing that out now it actually saves into the preferences 
 kinopanorama@msncom 
 theres nothing wrong with making a wikiblog on your user page provided you reamin
 its getting really weird i dont want to be doing this alone id rather have a second opinion whatever it is 
 i lost my cool after a while this guy was beginning to sound a bit like 
 ckatz i see from your user page that you are an experienced editor therefore im a bit hesitant to leave the standard uwdeleteN template in response to your recent edit to 
 wow glad you caught that as it certainly wasnt what was intended id only meant to undo a spammed external link in that article and several others seems the utility i was using did something other than what it reported so i will review the other edits as well thanks for bringing it to my attention and sorry for the inconvenience 
 ah understood no worries then happy editing 
 very cool i corrected something you wrote about fox hall being the tallest building in lowell until N i cant think of anything other than maybe a name change for river place that happened that year did you see i was in the sun recently i expected the interview to be more about wikipedia and less about me but either way i did mention the wikiproject but it didnt make the cut 
 did you mean to link to the bridge st bridge deletion discussion did you write the article if anything the page 
 anyway for now im gonna hang a csd tag on it for the gN criteria but id appreciate a more experienced set of eyes and opinion on it thanks 
 hmm well it looks like another admin thought so too its since been speedied but anyway would appreciate your thoughts on situations like these whether to keep going to 
 btw if you will check the edit history entry for your deletion you will see that external links obviously do not work in edit summaries so i advise you not to go that route in the future 
 third yes when i put the link in my address window it took me right to the appropriate diff page no problem there however i must say that when i put a link in an edit summary i feel obliged to check it in preview mode 
 re what pending discussion are you referring to as a new administrator are you aware of 
 with respect to the image it is important to discuss a change of this nature first because there are several issues with regards to the replacement the replacement images have been retouched and cropped and were actually mislabelled in some instances as being pluto and charon furthermore this is not a question of using a prettier image as evidenced by the number of comments about the disco ball (
 yes it is a more accurate representation but its nonfree so you cant just use it across articles willynilly in most of these articles its just in a table and its purpose is to just show pluto well the suckier image also does the same job the licensing of the photo takes precedence over the encyclopedic purpose 
 i hope this helps thanks for trying to work within the boundaries i think you are wise to ask for help in unfamiliar territory and if i have been unclear or you want further explanation im at your service 
 if it helps dana look at what i did on 
 sorry to have been delayed with this and everything else wikipedian i have been laid low by a cold or flu for the last few days the burkes boy article now seems to me to be asserting barely sufficient notability as winner of a number of major events that i would suggest leaving it its got reasonable references and is sufficiently encyclopedic that i cant think of any reason for it to go the other ones will be deleted as soon as i check that the time of the prod tag has reached five days 
 i see that the prod tag on 
 sir barnaby and best of all have gone to the big stable in the sky let me know if theres anything else with which i can be of service 
 this message is being left for both parties please stop edit warring over the use of flags in the television template this is a content dispute reverting one another over and over is more detrimental to the project than the presence of an image both of you are in danger of violating the 
 lol your a bit late already over sorry 
 oh and for the record i made sure i didnt break N rr note to islander loved your edit summary when you removed that warning from your talk page it was really funny i would give a barnstar for it but i fear you might not accept it anyway it was bloody funny nice one 
 i somehow dont think that a barnstar would be appropriate here p still i thank you for your kind sentiments we are going to have to agree to disagree when it comes to this matter you seem a decent chap and i know i am so heres hoping we just got off to an appalling start and can put this behind us 
 the edit war being already over arent really relevant the note was still valid i will emphasize however that it was just a note not a warning or a template if you have resolved it between yourselves great i was only trying to stop the backandforth on the page however since it has been brought up im curious to ask islander why he or she completely disagrees with me 
 i only referenced my sysop status to make obvious the fact that i know N rr and dont need to be told about it i certainly didnt mean to imply that i am immune to N rr or anything like that so sorry for any confusion there as for the edit war being over it is kinda relevant if there the problems have ended on their own no need to jump in in response to your question take a look at 
 ah but guidelines do have a higher status than template instructions as a guideline must reach consensus to become a guideline 
 you too brother and btw since you were previously involved with his arbcom i figure i should inform you that i started regarding further uncivil behavior by asgardian thanks 
 hey man thanks you too 
 let us hope it is a good one on a wiki note i have subscribed to 
 naturally the problem with that is that you are very enthusiastic in describing instances wherein galactus continued genocides of sentient beings are described as necessary or unavoidable which is fine and i have added a few of those myself the problem is that you and 
 could you add to the template the option of using the british gramme spelling 
 the best place for this request would be at 
 happy new year hope its off to a good start 
 thank you and to you as well 
 and a merry january to you thanks 
 morphh i added my own talk comment but maybe not to the best advantage a more personal one is on taxmans page in response to your comments there 
 i have made some comments im glad to see that theres been some recognition at the far that the move there may have been hasty in general id say that i have every confidence that you can take any legitimate specific points made and incorporate them in the article you have been doing a sterling job on the article and recognition of that is due i will help out as necessary but obviously i lack the background knowledge for major changes if theres some scutwork that needs doing feel free to call on me beyond that i will try to stay active on the talk page hopefully changes will be discussed and i can add my tuppence to them 
 i began a survey of duplicate links as id seen sandy had mentioned them from distibution to predicted effectseconomic i got these which have multiple links within the article laurence kotlikoff consumption tax economic growth government accountability office vernon l smith americans for free taxation interest rate export national retail foundation do you want to check them out and see if any want to be delinked i will carry on this evening if it would be helpful 
 happy to be the extra voice im actually quietly encouraged by marskels post on the far he was very fair minded on the uk corporation tax far and hopefully there should be either some answerable points or an end to the far soon i will continue with the housekeeping for now if youd prefer me to simply delink all duplicates i can but i thought id give you the opportunity to review them first 
 some multiples arising from the picture captions but i reckon thatuN s okay the see also section has multiples in it on the uk corporation tax far sandy objected to that although i wasnt quite sure of the rationale behind it anyway hope it helps i will try to have a read through and look for unnecessary links later let me know if anything else needs targeting 
 i have just stumbled across 
 well thats good i notice that cherlin has been inactive for several days i wonder if it would be appropriate to revert his changes to the lead and then try to discuss them on the talk page to see if either he or anyone else wishes to support the changes or would that be unnecessarily antagonistic 
 aha i wondered why the idea seemed familiar id had it already 
 hi all i saw in the references was a the equivalent in canadian units of a us fl oz that might conceivably be there as a convenience rather than an indication that us units are authorized i think its likely us units are allowed but i dont see where thats mentioned in the references given 
 it is in stated as metric units must be used or metric units and any other equivalent unit of measurement provided that the metric units are displayed more prominently hope this helps 
 all right then but that means theres nothing special about us measures then one could use customary chinese measures it seems 
 daredevils mixing of the ph with the fcb is part of the approach taken by 
 i am open to suggestions on this we seem to have reached a mile stone and should discuss where to go from here i think theres still a place for some fcb it is just a question of how much 
 it definitely is the way we should be moving however i think the approach could stand to be refined a bit more it is about the only way we are going to get articles like 
 agreed stubbing would seem to be unavoidable for some but as long as there is a solid image and accurate information with sources it should be ok i wish you hadnt mentioned 
 well yeah everything after the fcb is overlong but i was referring more to the ph and fcb themselves in this case 
 i thought we werent putting any of them on the list 
 hello yes we have been tracking and reverting the same person or link however actually involved the url wwwstevestonbcca the spammer out of what i can only assume is spite 
 yes i see that so you have added it back after he deleted it why 
 oh i see it is a different site scrap my questions or concerns sorry 
 no problem always happy to answer questions thanks for getting rid of todays spam by the way cheers 
 oh okay thanks 
 i removed a chunk of text from the article because it was copied from another website which means we cant use it i have also 
 whoathe fancruft has definately overrun this part of the castle as soon as i finish 
 as promised 
 the fundamental things that those articles are missing include commentary analysis and criticism from an outofuniverse perspective granted they were missing before anyway but now you have got little more than a list of appearances with a few notations on their significance if we are going sans fcb we really need to be looking more like 
 perhaps you might like to offer an opinion when ready yes i see what these two editors are saying but nothing more can be done until some thirdparty material such as marvel masters is sourced what is presently in place is still better than reams of poorly written fan cruft with pov the bones are there now we need the meat from thirdparty sources

 i believe that

 spiderman has been picked up for ga review which can be 
 looks like you will have a pleasant surprise awaiting you upon your return

 i believe that 
 i forgot to mention the same for the above 
 hi sorry to bother you user orangemike deleted the stub on this topic that i started so that we would have a place to define some common uses of monotone none of which are covered in any of our articles i tried to explain in detail where it was headed and dont seem to be getting anywhere could you kindly help and explain to me how i should proceed i dont try to be contentious but apparently im being told that this word doesnt mean what is described in the dictionary while it does mean something that try as i might i cant fit to any of the uses that i have spent many of my working hours on btw just looking at the dictionary definition doesnt help with figuring out exactly what features make something monotonous what am i getting wrong how could i help create the space for answers to common questions on monotony to be collected or presented in wikipedia uN preceding 
 hello regarding your message i appreciate your concern but it would have been more appropriate to enquire as to the situation rather than just assuming the worst im certainly not interested in edit warring nor do i personally care about where the redirect goes however there was an established consensus as to where the redirect should go and the page has been plagued with multiple changes since then part of an administrators role is to ensure consensus reached through discussion is maintained and that involves using our discretion to do so in this case it is clear that leaving the page redirected to the tv series will not achieve that goal accordingly the best choice is to protect the consensus version if you disagree im happy to discuss it with you and i do apologize if my edit summary wasnt clear as to my intentions however i still feel that there is no need whatsoever to suggest a misuse of the admin bit when a thorough examination of the details clearly reveals it is not 
 look this really shouldnt be such a big deal i can assure you that it is certainly not meant as any sort of comment on your move to protect the page i will revert myself if you wish but i really think you should open a discussion on the matter or at least make some sort of mention of it on the talk page otherwise the page remains locked theres no clear explanation of why and the regulars who have been working under consensus are left in the dark 
 theres an explanation for why in the protection log so noone is in the dark i know your edit is no comment on my protection of the page but thats also not what im talking about you just must not edit through protection in the way that you did im going to leave this now and unprotect it 
 i am not sure why you reverted my edits i made those changes because i found them useful i am sure others will as well additionally they did not take up any extra space since that space had been blank beforehand please revert back 
 in principle the idea is interesting however the template itself is not designed for such a fine degree of directional input nor is it appropriate given the constraints imposed by the typial wikipedia page this template is only intended to give an approximate indication of where other cities are 
 im not advocating expanding the template size i only want to make better use of the space available the other four direction possibilities need not be available at all but people will still benefit from being able to use these four what does it matter what the template is intended to do that is open to change 
 i have rereverted 
 the changes have been removed again pending discussion again the addition of the additional points is not necessary and does not improve the template in its current form in fact it actually complicates the design as it is nearly impossible to differentiate between the different positions given the coarse resolution possible with a textbased template system if you still feel strongly about his i would suggest you open a discussion on the template page to get input from other editors 
 the 
 most indian formations did however the indian prefix means it was part of the indian army 
 i hope to hear from you soon thanks 
 im sorry ckatz i feel like a squeaky wheel but im confused check out 
 i reverted your edit back to was after chatting with a few editors to make sure the proper way to state a show that formerly aired is using was have a good day 
 thanks for the note however the correct wording is to retain the present tense creative works are considered to exist even after ceasing production 
 ahh kay i started a talk page discussion and came here to tell you about it then saw this can you link me to that naming convention i gotta go for right now i will keep this page up for when i get home from work
 the link was removed because it does not meet the 
 i have created a page with advice for improving articles such as this one let me know if you are interested 
 could you please take a look at 
 ok at first glance i have suggested a compromise way forwards either way it seems that the article should note the rival leadership university of nebraska though that seems to be a nonnotable correspondence school 
 im not sure it is a compromise so much as a deferment of the conflict i create a new article on clm i nominate lu for merger into clm fm vehemently disagrees assuming the merger goes through the question would be how much material from lu to merge i would tend towards nothing or nesttonothing fm towards all or nearly all how is this less wikidrama than an rfc on a rename or rewrite 
 i suppose one way around is to ask the merger consensus for guidance on how much to merge should it be merged another likely scenario is that ends in no consensus so step becomes an afd on lu 
 firstly im not prejudging fms response he may find a source that establishes notability or may be amenable to a merger which adds information to the combined article in a way that all can agree on secondly 
 please explain why the wikipedia deletion policy was not followed deleting this page on the same day it was listed in articles for deletion the discussion lasts at least seven full days also the protection of the page from recreation after improvement seems highly excessive please explain this as well 
 thank you for your prompt response i prefer not to split hairs about differences between policies and requirements or who is wikilawyering whom but yours and another admins comments require rebuttal defamation requires the material be untrue the subject has led a complex interesting and deliberately public life but the facts were referenced with half page associated press articles published in numerous us newspapers national primetime cbs news show coverage frontpage coverage in newsweeklies and magazines on two continents and extensively corroborated by the subjects own words some of the details were perhaps unflattering depending on ones perspective but were not defamatory neither was there any contention no one has disputed the news coverage accounts or what the subject said about himself the latter was used to add detail to the news coverage it was my understanding that the 
 thanks again for the reply 
 while im grateful for you to protecting what is undoubtedly the right version p i honestly dont believe that a meaningful and constructive discussion can take place with maels attitude aside from anything while you are obviously not allowed to comment on the issue at hand having protected it im sure you will reach an opinion on the issue and it will be similar to either mine or maels and i can guess which one that wasnt too obsequious was it uN fuN 
 i really dont mind if ckatz offers an opinion even if he blocked the article despite my ability to prattle on about wpthis and wpthat im not much of a stickler for rules particularly ones which exclude people from participating the more the merrier 
 hi can you join in order to offer us your thoughts it would be most appreciated thanks 
 thanks for expanding the hook mine often tend to be a little too concise 
 hi there trying to get your attention is tough when everyone is vying for it did you notice the 
 thanks i also pointed it out because i know a number of articles i had on there are some that you like to work on 
 i probably would have gotten to sinnott and simon eventually but i started to feel like i was abusing the peer review process did you see my note in a section above about another user who likes to work on comics creator articles 
 i meant your talk page about five sections up from here hey have fun 
 just want to bother you one more time and then i will leave you to your work i need to get going anyway take a look and see how much 
 the first time around i was asked to reconstruct it i thought i did and now im a vandal im not sure i understand 
 no problem and thanks forleaving me a note so that i could correct my previous message as mentioned the issue is with adding promotional links you may find the 
 or 
 you may be interested to know that 
 also for the template those are all plutoids and plutoid candidates so the change is accurate i also dont see anything wrong with categorizing a plutoid for naming purposes as a plutoid since that does not remove it from the dwarf planet or tno categories 
 per the release the two known and named plutoids are pluto and eris it is expected that more plutoids will be named as science progresses and new discoveries are made the text further down about naming apears to be related to resolving the overlap with regards to naming objects between the iau the wgpsn and the csbn im sure we will eventually see sedna et al declared as plutoids or dwarf planets but for now only two are official 
 noted you changes over at http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or gary_gruber unfortunately as you pointed out the subject of the article appears to be gatekeeping the content and he quickly reverted your changes i have had similar problems there as well im not very experienced in dealing with this kind of situation any help or direction you can offer in order to help release that page from his control 
 thanks for the continued help at 
 why did you delete the norwegian flag from the aha article i see no reason for removing it aha is from norway always have been always will be and the flag is a nice adittion to the article i like an answer please 
 it isnt a question of where they are from the 
 if one should go after those rules there isnt really a place for flags at all this is not a scientific paper my friend and there is no doubt where aha is born numourous other bands and peoples bios includes the flag many british australian and american bands have them flag goes back on 
 being a scientific paper has nothing to do with it this is an encyclopedia with a series of policies and guidelines developed under consensus please read through the manual of style and the 
 i have read the guidelines and as i stated above if one should go after those rules there isnt really a place for flags at all 
 that may or may not be the case but disagreeing with site policies doesnt give you the right to ignore them if you disagree the proper method is to seek change of the guideline 
 hey there just wanted to point you in 
 got two peer reviews on this one now pretty cool lots of advice to look at no idea if or when id find the time to actually use it but its there if you can find the time at some point 
 great if theres anything i can do to help let me know and i will see what i can do 
 first off who is the sockmaster second dont copypaste the page from the form onto the main spi page every spi case gets placed on its own page when you hit the save page button after following the form instructions on 
 i get the regular edit page with the instructions and everything when i click on it did you replace sockmaster with the actual name of the sockmaster in the box 
 i fixed it for you its supposed to be selfexplanatory when you click on the button the top of the page you mentioned has the instructions and the actual edit box where you place the suspected sock puppets and your evidence is on the bottom again i dont have a clue what you are looking at because i dont get anything that you see i cant tell you what the problem is 
 hello and thank you for the swift response tonights vandalism was relatively minor in nature being more of a nuisance factor however i did block for six months based on past history given your attention to the matter however i have now reduced that term to two months and extended it to the second ip thank you again for taking a proactive approach to this matter please feel free to ask if you have nay questions about this cheers 
 hey dijxtra you have removed homer simpson but it says till march N cheers 
 ok this is wierd im very very sorry i dont know how this happened i remember that the bot reported that the nomination expired and i didnt check i dont know why damn im realy terrified now i dont know how that happened sorry im sure it wont happen again ( 
 i hope it wont happen again cause i have to rfc on you afterall you are working for aid good luck 
 no look i dont have anything against homer simpson in fact hes one of my favourite cartoon characters this was just a pure mistake we all err an error can happen to everybody dont take it so seriously if i had anything against homer id state that somewhere and try to discuss things i dont think this mistake of mine is so great that it deserves mentioning of rfc i did many nice things on wikipedia and not one bad thing its not as if i did that N times 
 hey dijxtra i have found an error i hope you dont get angry because i only talk to you on this subjects i dont know how it happened but aidbot removed last nominee btw this rfc thing is just a joke i hope you dont take it serios take care 
 hoh hoh i have a bug if last nomination doesnt end with the bot drops it i will fix it asap thanks for noticing that 
 what makes you say they have changed their site the fact that he is halfhuman is explicitly there on the most recent and update version of the site i know this fact upsets some fanboys but thats not a wikipedia problem sorry 
 thank you for resolving the half human nonsense the bbc site is inferior to the show itself and it makes for a good example as an unreliable reliable source 
 after i finished getting 
 i noticed which is why i mentioned it 
 im puzzled why you dont see a graph showing a rough trend of vandalism correction effort over time being useful in general to the poll but you are entitled to your own view since you are now holding the position that the illustration is somehow a material change to the poll i intend on elaborating my comment in the discussion and including the image there can i trust that you will not remove it again 
 there are a number of issues with the graphic and its placement first off we shouldnt be tinkering with the lead while the poll is under way secondly the graphic itself is confusing and hard to interpret there is no explanation of what the different axes represent no qualification as to how the results are compiled and no indication as to whether or not it is even relevant counting rollbacks is not a definitive measure of vandalism rollbacks are often used as a speedy revert of other material especially given that many users have scripts that allow proper edit comments when rolling back finally im not sure why you feel it is appropriate to include this graph when you were opposed to including the poll results 
 i have no objection to the changes to 
 heh id rather not have to barter for civility the only thing about the guidelines is that they are just that guidelines there was a discussion in the long ago on this and we went with abbreviated forms the problem with wikipedia is that you can gather a gang and argue most anything something that may never be worked out long short back again the demoralising part is that there is only quality control on a few monitored articles the rest is a wilderness where anything goes for now i have no objection to the longer version 
 im sorry you feel that following the same guidelines the rest of us do is bartering for civility 
 nonetheless i held for a few days because i didnt particularly care however today a slew of information has been added to the planet x article about lykawkas planet and i realised that if i was to hold to toms separation policy i would be spending the rest of my wiki career removing this information which i didnt particularly want to do especially since i felt it should be there anyway and that the other article wasnt worth saving so i reverted the merge and reinstated all the old material but i figured tom would burst his gasket when he found out so i thought id ask for a second opinion let me know what you think 
 thing is you have to provide a 
 reverting changes by an editor with a history of pov incidents is perfectly acceptable and does not in any way limit my responsibilities as an admin 
 please stop generalising im just asking that you stop making the personal comments in the edit summaries i didnt think that was unreasonable and required anything in return by the by there is still an ongoing discussion about guidelines here 
 as you tend to quickly erase responses on your talk page im responding here you are the only editor in wpc who uses those abbreviations the sectiontitle discussion is misdirection it has nothing to do with your yearslong consistent insertion of nonstandard edits and after they are removed slipping them back in 
 true i was still doing it the old way a lot happening here at present apologies 
 claims of medical conditions may or may not be true there is no way to confirm assuming it is true he has some condition affecting his behavior edits and civility i would argue that a person who may be genuinely unstable should not be editing a collaborative encyclopedia while there is no way to know for certain i would put great weight in someone claiming so about oneself i would seek the advice of an admin in wpc 
 it is ironic to me that the sort of behavior of which you accuse 
 a few things first of all the rfc has prettymuch fallen by the wayside yes i am sure we can resolve this between us past tense for a ph fine if you want to cull a word for repetition fine as to perennial well thats possibly pov 
 ok all the recommended changes added mistakes corrected and additional appearances retained looks pretty good 
 and yes saw the other thread i will respond when i have a spare hour as thats not the work of five minutes regards 
 well a close look at reveals that there are several ways to write an article its all there 
 what i see there is a brightline demarcation between publication history and fictional history as separate sections do you see something different 
 you are receiving this message because you have signed up for the 
 again thanks uN and nbsp 
 theres no one way to do this 
 the guidelines give and as distinct sections as i and other editors have repeatedly pointed out publication history and fictional character biography or fictional team history are not blended into a single section you can adjust the subhead titles wording for particular cases but the guidelines spell out that we dont blend fiction and reallife 
 so with the wording above in mind the suggestions presented are just that and are a starting point 
 and you read that to mean you can do anything you want including nonstandard abbreviations throwing out established sections in a manner that no other editor espouses and mixing reallife and fictional history and you wonder why you have been blocked from articles given a years probation following an arbitration and have 
 dont you think the spoiler note on refs should stay i wouldnt want to mess anyone up 
 generally speaking wikipedia doesnt use spoiler tags even in references hope this helps 
 nice work on 
 hang in there the best advice i can offer is if things get too tense the best thing to do is step back and do something else 
 i have reremoved the prod tag that you added back to 
 i have also now removed the prod tag you added back to 
 those were the only two thank you for pointing out that the policy allows even a pages creator to remove a deletion tag while that seems so antituitive to me that i hadnt thought to check im now aware of it 
 either way it isnt a suitable contribution and has been removed 
 just wanted to give you a friendly headsup to let you know i reverted your punctuation changes on 
 thats a subtle one but im glad to know it having to put the punctuation outside the quote marks went against all my instincts glad to know my instincts were actually going along with wiki mos so this is a relief thanks again 
 not a problem yeah it is a little tricky 
 thank you so much tenebrae the world is better off with wikipedia and your efforts in that regard are very much appreciated 
 i accidentally put back the wrong verson of my references you didnt have to delete the entire thing 
 i have asked some dissenting editors to acknowledge the wikipedia naming conventions that emphasize that article titles should be the ones that are most recognizable to englishspeakers if they do not i think we should ask for a 
 hey jc as you probably surmised from my contribution history i have been away for several months i plan to return to wikiediting regularly and its good to see some of my old and treasured colleagues still here fighting the good fight with kudos and regards 
 thank you for the message 
 gday tenebrae i was wondering about the item of sgt fury #N that said the two redheaded combat kellys are not one in the same could you elaborate please they seem to look alike and i believe the atlas kelly was a wwii vet to tell you the truth i have never read either version 
 well i checked the citation re sgt fury #N with my actual copy of sgt fury #N and you know the appendix to the handbook of the marvel universe is actually incorrect and mdash the letters page actually says nothing one way or the other about combat kelly in wwii being or not being the combat kelly of the korean war i will keep investigating and mdash i found my old fury and capt savage comics but not yet combat kelly and mdash but thanks for getting me to compare the cite with the cited 
 want to help me work on this one its likely to pass ga after i work on the lead and if theres anything you can add to the article in general that would be helpful 
 thanks you always make me curious dropping hints like that but sometimes i feel it might be better not to know 
 i dont really have anything to add to my N feb comment at 
 i didnt count em thats what bots are for see the category page i linked to in that thread to see how i came up with the numbers 
 so i will now have to go back and change a few titles in the downtime so that the valid and accurate information can be retained as opposed to staying with an inferior version 
 theres an arbitration being prepared by another editor not me about your consistently anticonsensus behavior the changes in titles dont seem to be offending anyone else is patently untrue you tried to push your idiosyncratic nonmos format onto awesome android and the rfc consensus there was not to blend fictional inuniverse material and realworld material if we need to go to rfc again thats fine thats the proper first step in the mediation process 
 actually if you look at the talk page for said article i initally opposed a ph and then supported it you didnt help the process by repeatedly reverting out additional and extra information or my attempts to trial other titles your claim as to antisocial behaviour is also inflammatory and only opinion a recent attempt at comment failed as it was demonstrated that all that is being offered up is opinion 
 what recent attempt at comment awesome android what discussion ensued there went against your edits i believe you are being disingenuous about the arbitration case being prepared regarding your behavior that case exists and stating factually that this is so is not inflammatory and only opinion 
 look further up your talk page you are the one who mentioned an action against me 
 oops forgot to sign 
 yes i noticed that and reported it to the vandal page when he was blocked last i had posted a warning on that talk page but it looks like the ip changed working on blocking the new ip 
 the ip N was just blocked for N hrs good luck im going to bed zzzzz 
 twice in as many days now you have reverted page moves on this page without any discussion per 
 it is important to note that there was no discussion of the page moves to begin with nor any consensus to do so as well per 
 again consensus is not necessary for making edits on wikipedia consensus is only necessary in the event of a dispute as far as loose ends are concerned iirc theres a bot that corrects double redirects all that remains then is ensuring that actual article links use the newer title i agree with you that using the us date is totally incorrect but using the european date is also incorrect better to choose something that wont lead to disputes or debates later and avoids conflict uN 
 read through 
 actually no just had other things to do first off not all of your content is fine as demonstrated by the fact that you have been reverted by several different editors second there is a vast difference between an encyclopedia article on the word fuck and your saying what kind of fucking idiot places a comma in a place like that jesus fucking christ i could see a frigging semicolon but how far up your ass would you have to stick your head to find that commasurely you can see the difference 
 the article does not meet the 
 as you nominated 
 hurrah hurrah hurray yes that is my eventual goal thank you very much 
 thanks for reverting the vandalism on the sago mine page 
 also no problem vandalism is quick to fix 
 can you confirm that these two text pieces are mutually contradictory and if so do you think the fact belongs in the article i will put your talk page on my watchlist pending the resolution of this discussion so you can reply right here 
 thank you for your excellent work i hope and expect to see you around wikiproject comics often 
 as for the editorial apology in the back of the special if your suspicions about the art being from the adaptation of repent are correct the waters become even more muddied does the box not say mangods from beyond the stars rather than just mangods i have strongly suspected that this thing was the result of some gross miscommunication between staffers and thomas name was put on it because he was the mags editor but he actually had nothing to do with it i really doubt that there is anything to recover unlike a 
 its nice btw to meet someone else with a fond memory of the old marvel magazines if you create any related articles let me know id love to collaborate with regards 
 while i now note that you do have it arndt in the uwosf article and in your ref cite to his page there what i see on his own page is amdt take a look for yourself i will wait for you to do so and comment here rather than go change the article now 
 thats just the letters running together due to the small type do a wordsearch for amdt and you will see what i mean no biggie 
 could you please email me the latest version of the above mentioned article it has been deleted under very blurry circumstances and i intend to reinstate the article so i could correct all the mishaps i might have had during the creation of the article the first time if nothing else id just like to have it in my archive then for future use if any 
 i have restored it to a subpage of your user page you can find it 
 ckatz it seems to me that you make error editing the article rolex you keep it in the form of propaganda of the rolex company do you consider yourself as a specialist about rolex 
 hi ckatz i have seen in the deletion log that you deleted the article 
 looks like you took care of it 
 hello ckatzi was wondering if you could delete the article 
 done thanks for letting me know cheers 
 hey i noticed your work on the article on 
 and you are free to do that 
 please comment on 
 i think the problem is now fixed but it will not hurt to take a quick peak 
 you have violated 
 if you can find a third opinion that says that the article falls under general sanctions sure but im not convinced that it does 
 oh please dont play coy you have been in exactly this situation before where an admin determined that information about abortion in an article otherwise unrelated to abortion fell under the sanctions im sure you remember that bombshell actress 
 oh that jane russell character i remember her forgive me could you point me to where it was determined that her biography fell under N rr 
 fair enough 
 how well this yielding rescues thee from shame 
 i know i have said it before so prepare to roll your eyes but hopefully i will have the time to start putting something together the idea is i want to lay out the charges one by one so that asgardian and the community can clearly see what other editors think of his behavior so that he and they can respond clearly to each point as needed im going to try to word everything as neutrally as possible while still being factual and getting the point across to leave the judgment up to mostly uninvolved editors diffs are a big help in that regard because then its not just people making claims also id like to point out the most contentious articles such as juggernaut rhino abomination etc 
 well feel free to use my list over at the juggernaut talk as a small starting point and check with 
 will do i will let some of the more involved editors as well as the general public at the comics project comment and add before i take it live in fact lest some emergency happen im going to put some time in on it right now 
 good luck you are going to need it asgardian is nothing if not tenacious and argumentative and has a loooooong list that will be really hard and disordered to check through so be prepared to put down an awful lot of work i lost almost all energy and interest in him long ago and most others do so much quicker i think he may find it funny to see just how much he can get away with for how long and how many buttons he can push in a hinthintnudgenudge manner still N or N th of his actual offenses should logically be more than enough to get him permanently banned but youd be hardpressed to prove most of them or know which temporary ips that are his or not of course then he will simply return with another sockpuppet but what to do 
 im not going to go hunting for anything more im just going to stick with whatever people posted 
 hmm that seems to be a very coherent and matteroffact case good work if you already added all of my list mentions i dont see that i have much to add especially as i have tendency to get emotional 
 saw your edit just now theres other passages which fall in the same category as promotional in flavour and not really encyclopedic but i have never had the energy to take them on the aboriginal section for instance is just fluff and doesnt even mention the first nations studies department institutional spin doctors always patrol these pages would it be worthwhile do you think to post 
 yes it was from their brochure professional pr types are not very creative and usually like to user boilerplate as all teh wording is carefully calculated to represent policy theres other sections here that are likely from if not the catalog or their website from the sfu news or other publications all very dry you will notice theres no mention of the psa crisis back in the N s and other political turmoil someone removed even the slightest mention of that i dont know enough about it to write it up properly but i know sfu is sensitive about it or even any association with their past except the catchy radical by design cooptation of N s liberalism institutional articles are corporate in nature and a pov watch for corporate or institutional softsoaping is always a good thing reading with a jaundiced eye is becoming a sort of sport for me after so much wikiexploration 
 hello and welcome thanks for the contribution it was however removed because of wikipedias 
 wasnt it you who just said something akin to spirit of the N revert rule about repeatedly enforcing versions that go against consensus well in your own words there is his starter justification then 
 thanks for clearing that up for me have a great one 
 simply put you tried something i disagreed this is not a case to be formally contested instead i would suggest you open a discussion on the articles talk page to see if anyone else supports your idea 
 hello this message is being sent to inform you that there currently is a discussion at 
 thanks asgardian had not done the courtesy of informing me as one respondent there noted doesnt look like a civility concern to me and as you noted there asgardian did completely change the page and put in a deceptive summary thank you both for your time and efforts on that page 
 please dont revert things on reflex i moved the pluto stuff from terminology for good reason it had nothing to do with the actual definition of the terms it just clutered up the text 
 please dont make assumptions as to why i make certain edits i would suggest that you discuss your proposed changes in greater detail and seek consensus first rather than the method you are currently using 
 just because its different doesnt mean its difficult the jump between xp and linux is generally smaller than the jump between xp and mac but plenty of people make that just fine while it would help if you explained exactly what you need these computers for i highly recommend you check out and try a livecd for yourself once you have downloaded the iso file from the edubuntu site follow to burn it to a cd then try it out trying linux no longer requires a physical install you can simply put it in your cd drive reboot and your computer will boot to the cd which though it is slower than the hard drive allows you to try linux with no risk at all of erasing your existing data and no worries at all about having to remove it i really hate to see people forcing themselves to use windows out of fear of the unknown without even getting a taste of what else is out there especially when it could save them quite a bit of money keep in mind there are plenty of schools out there that run nothing but linux 
 i appreciate your effort but i think you dont understand my objection i use quite a bit of free software im aware that windows is a terrible os and that there are better free ones out there i have used some of them we are not talking about my thinking that something is difficult or fear of the unknown here we are talking about a separate sociological problem which is traditionally invisible to free software supporters and which is why so many people think that you guys sound like you have been drinking the koolaid its good to know about so read on the problem is that we are dealing with technophobic people and with their comfort zones you dont get those people to listen to you by telling them that its silly for them to be technophobic and suspicious of changes that they dont understand now we have got computers that were changed from a familiar but suboptimal status quo to something that is better in some ways but worse in others that change dragged some people out of their comfort zones if you want to sell an idea to someone whos been dragged out of their comfort zone you dont lecture to them in a language they dont understand you dont move the goalposts still further to something more removed from their comfort zone and explain to them that its better there you let them go back to their comfort zone and you talk to them when they are calm im perfectly happy to try out various free oss on one of the work computers and when i find one that will be easy to transition to i start introducing it to people and eventually they will ask for it to be installed on the other machines meanwhile we have got three out of three machines screwed up and wed like to be able to revert to status quo before introducing more fundamental changes in the most crassly pragmatic sense im unlikely to get approval to switch to a new os right now but if i can fix the computers and then introduce something new when we can see it in a better light its likely to be easy salesman know thy customer 
 can you elaborate why the images on 
 they dont significantly increase readers understanding of the topic 
 i disagree they illustrate scenes from the episode making it easier to understand if you dont know what the sunsphere is it doesnt make a lot of sense and that image explains where they are and what they do during it 
 excellent work sir those were some key additions 
 you can always sign in and take the credit with a null edit i think its important to keep working on the quality for the articles of key importance and i think your work on comics creators articles is probably even more critical than that of characters ayers is a good one and id love to see articles like 
 you may be interested in and and and all socks of one very uncreative he has been and 
 thanks the neverending string of socks continues 
 shes apparently reincarnated as 
 thanks for the note after checking the contributions it seems to match cheers 
 given that these seems to be turning into the usual problem of or and i by adjusting the wording to find a solution that everyone can accept i would like some unbiased outside input to clear it up and give me some input i can actually trust so im asking you and boz as you are editors whose judgement i trust to me subjectively the two involved editors there seem too severely biased to be willing to compromise in the slightest and im tired of going around in circles about it 
 id love to help but im not sure what you are asking me to look at specifically is there a discussion ongoing that you can point to 
 where you come in is that this also means that im so jaded at this point that i cant take almost anything they said as noninsanely biased so i need some sensible outside input about what i should do should i take the time to dig up quotes and issue numbers again only to have these ignored and censored once more or what should i do or could you even find the time to help tenebrae check it over and find a neutral solution to me this is the bad side of the character articles in a nutshell situation if complete devotees gather they will easily censor the page from any references they dislike ignore arguments and contradictory quotes and simply state that adjusting for accuracy and allowing both sides of the issue constitutes an editwar that they of course have no part of right this i own the pages thing was going on over a year ago after i finally lost all energy of repeating myself over and over in the talk only to have it ignored and i have no enthusiasm about entering it again but also severely dislike when wikipedia is used for some sort of onesided propaganda purposes especially if it connects to just rationalising genocide 
 to be honest im really not sure what to do about that situation i mean if you have got editor who are going to do their darndest to keep an article the way they like it theres only so much an admin can do directly thats a situation thats not unique to 
 but this is about blatant severely biased censorship and misinformation not about preference to me the entire point of wikipedia is to maintain as many sides of an issue as possible i dont censor the ones they prefer and have even inserted several of them myself i feel a strong fundamental wrongness to this type of thing going on couldnt you and tenebrae go in and mention some sort of compromise to keep it somewhat balanced or maybe adjust my edits in a way that you consider acceptable 
 i dont usually like to jump into content disputes unless i have some kind of idea what to expect but i could take a look when i have the time which may or may not be soon i dont have access to most of the comics in question so i can only go by what you say you see there and what they say they see there and if i dont remember what happened in that particular comic i will have to go and look it up to be on a more even ground also in some cases its a question of interpretation are you right are they right or is there no right answer its a situational thing i guess your censorship might be their keeping out irrelevant details your misinformation might be their misinterpretation i cant know that until i have seen the source material myself thats why i dont ususally get involved unless i know what to expect i can tell you that i have most of byrnes run on ff and a large chunk of the N s silver surfer series if that helps cant think of what else off the top of my head you might need me to look at 
 for starters these images clearly show doctor strange helping galactus in reconstituting himself http or or imgN imageshackus or imgN or N or deathN gzjpg http or or imgN imageshackus or imgN or N or deathN vsjpg http or or imgN imageshackus or imgN or N or deathN jwjpg http or or imgN imageshackus or imgN or N or deathN urjpg and this clearly shows the sentience of the previous universe to be separate from galactus when it propels him away from itself during the big bang http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or filegalangalactusjpg i could start finding or uploading more specific scans as you ask for them 
 on the birth of the universe picture it is clear that the rocketing starship is flying away from something some big orangeyyellow mass of energy but wheter the sentience of the universe is located in the energy or is with the ship or is omnipresent is unclear to me the voice appears to be with the ship but it could in reality be projected from anywhere and everywhere 
 well i read the go now comment as someone sending him away and in addition to this the editorial handbooks have mentioned eternity as being reborn in the big bang galactus referred to the entity as father during the trial of galactus and there certainly was more than one product coming out of the big bang explosion he was never stated to encapsule it within him simply to have been incubated within it and transformed into a galactic ravager yet they continue to insert galactus is the product of the union between the sentience of the universe and galan over and over instead of the neutral a product that i have changed it to or my most recent attempt galactus was created from the union between the sentience of the universe and galan they revert either to the biased and imho severely misleading one 
 you might be right i suppose its a matter of individual interpretation at that point it doesnt seem important to say that galactus was separated from sentience at that point and i would figure its enough to say that the sentience sent him out into the universe as far as him being a ravager id simply say thats a matter of universal balance we have cosmic entities that preserve and create life and we have those that destroy instead 
 or that the consequences of the storyline in fantastic four #N were examined in 
 your paragraph seems to meet npov although i have not verified the information against any sources personally 
 ok im glad to hear it would you be willing to do a verification and maybe reinsert these specific edits to the page to avoid any more not so merry goaround again 
 in reading and participating in the mhp discussion i have learned more about probability then i ever intended or thought possible i must say it has been an interesting ride i also noticed that rick brought up game theory in the posts above that reminded me that i wanted to ask someone knowledgeable about the bit under variants that says the host is rewarded whenever the contestant incorrectly switches or incorrectly stays switching wins N or N the time at the nash equilibrium this seems to imply that if the producers want to make sure the contestant never gets a N or N chance to win the car all they have to do is give monty a cookie if the contestant chooses wrong which is counter intuitive to say the least can you explain this in more detail thanks 
 ps for me it has been a roller coaster ride too i have changed my mind dramatically several times learnt a lot had a lot of fun hopefully made more friends than enemies 
 congratulations its my pleasure to let you know that consensus being reached you are now an 
 thanks for the congratulations 
 congrats i am happy to hear that you were successful in the rfa good luck luck for the future 
 woohoo congrats 
 hello i have noticed that you reverted my edit in 
 unfortunately the text as written does not help toward that goal it needs a rewrite contains a lot of speculative material and too much plot detail for the main article while your efforts are certainly appreciated in this case it would be better to discuss first

 ah sorry i missed that in my aggravation i overlooked the very first sentence i will be more careful with my critique next time thanks for pointing it out

 thanks for leaving a note no worries about wheelwarring at all i think you have done a good job in monitoring the discussion cheers 
 thanks i hope he understands he was twice lucky that someone asked me to look at his talk page while you were gone and then that i thought maybe hed now take heed about not typing all that comes to mind in the thick of things cheers

 i have decided to take on revising the mlj or archie titles and superhero information over the next few months nobody else seems to be interested in tidying up a very untidy corner it was first mooted N months ago at 
 thanks for the positivity im sure you are aware that its a bit working in the dark as to style content etc working from scratch so good to see im somewhere on the right lines see you in 
 on behalf of the arbitration committee 
 i have moved the statement you made on the case page to the evidence page as no more changes should be made to the case page i have copied asis but given that your statement is now part of the evidence you may want to copyedit it regards 
 im thinking of removing myself as an involved party from the arbitration case because im apparently really not on board with what nightscream is trying to accomplish do you have any good reasons for me to remain 
 best 
 unfortunately i am probably just as inexperienced in arbitration cases as you are i dont know that you cant request other sanctions and although id think it should not be a yes or no proposition for all i know it may be that way you might want to try asking on one of the cases talk pages or maybe contact the clerk 
 fyi tenebrae i replied to you on my talk page a few days ago 
 and 
 well i am not sure what the next step is and i have been feeling that asking the clerk would be a good idea i am finishing up my statement and hope to have it posted within the hour 
 hey thanks the only writing i have done is some freelance work for 
 a day has gone by since your revision and no one had any problem with the colors or with the solar system bodies having different colors besides you i dont think trying to change that will be a popular move 
 theres no need for the aggressive tone here and in your edit summaries my suggestion was merely to discuss the change before implementing it not after simply put many of the astronomy pages are hightraffic articles with relatively stable content several have reached ga and fa status so the general aim is to try to coordinate changes rather than just alter individual articles 
 well i apologize for the aggression i was frustrated that you hadnt replied well as i mentioned i had said that id do it on the talk page of ceres and that if someone objected it was fine but i wish you would have left a message there to state your opinion on the matter before you reverted it also i try to pick a color that matches wiki formatting and perhaps some sort of mythology (
 copying this conversation to jenna jamesons talk page can we continue it there 
 thank you both very very much for the thorough research responded in more detail on 
 just thought i should comment that the article when using the jameson book currently doesnt use specific page numbers in this i mean note N specifically if this was rectified this would improve the article hope you dont mind the message 
 if he observes our coi guidelines for the next few days id say yeah no prob if youd like to monitor the article i will take the tag off for the time being 
 congratulations on getting fairtax to fa an excellent job 
 i am a little late here but i also congratulate you on a job well done 
 im contemplating breaking off the discovery and exploration section and remaking it as the lead article in a solar system subtopic since you have been against the idea of breaking off the section i wanted your approval before i went ahead 
 i suppose i can take that as tacit support 
 knightlago the drafting arbitrator will start posting on the 
 got a few 
 hey there were you going to add anything more to the workshop page 
 anything you want to add can go right 
 the sources are there to back up the notability you go take it to the talk page 
 i see you also reverted me with yet another invalid reasoning the point of my edit was that 
 hi ckatz what is your justification for sp on 
 further to the above request please see 
 hey there ok im not surprised someone put 
 cool i responded to the notice at ani i have set up a 
 well i went ahead and worked on it you can see my new stubby version 
 N week first block hmmm i see you issued the warning and ha did exactly the edit you warned about but i am not certain that you are the right person to make the block with almost N edits to the solar system article it might be considered that you are not as impartial as may be desired i suggest that you request review at wpan as regards the tariff while there has been some history as regards the editor and that article it appears to me to be somewhat severe for a first sanction in any case i shall be linking my concerns expressed here at harryalffas talkpage for consideration by any reviewer cheers 
 thanks for the input i certainly considered those points before issuing the block however harryaffla has a long long history of singlepurpose editing on 
 thanks if you are content that you have taken the appropriate neutral position then i see no reason to take it anywhere else cheers 
 fyi there might not be any follow ups but i opened a discussion on this subject at 
 agreed im still wondering if there was a way to determine the popularity of a page is there a wiki tool to measure how many hits an article gets 
 just a friendly notice that with the posting of the 
 that said theres probably no need to further add to the workshop page as it is already 
 hi i undid your last edit as policy allows commercial sites or sites behind paywalls to be used as references 
 it looks like you are doing a lot of work on the article so whatever you decide is fine with me 
 on behalf of the arbitration committee 
 asked for a checkuser to look into this might take a while 
 david a has been running up against thebalance and mobbone on that article for a good long time aside from asgardian having trouble with all three of them in the past i may have to ultimately appeal for a longterm topic ban for the three of them on that article if they simply cant work together theres no excuse to allow this to continue especially in the wake of asgardians banning 
 thank you 
 thanks for your thoughts its going to be a busy weekend but i will see if i can pencil in some time to have another look at this situation asking emperor and or or jgreb to have a look is not a bad idea in the meantime i would support a longterm topic ban for the two of them if only because the fighting has gone on for so long but i would not count out mobbone as he seems to pop back in and out from time to time ban david and balance and you create a vacuum for him to step in bad idea i think this is an ideal situation to bring up formal mediation and if that fails or if one or more party refuses then we will discuss a ban 
 im employed so far in fact this week for the first time in a long time we are working overtime 
 i dont mind discussing personal details with you however anyone at all can read anything i post 
 actually i was thinking more along the lines of formal 
 as per wpdisambiguation the statistics clearly show that capilano university is the most requested incoming wikilinks show the same 
 i am curious as to what you mean by constituting an overwhelming majority of traffic it should make sense then that schools such as 
 no response 
 you are incorrect because the majority of hits from the disambiguation page go to the kwantlen school the other use for kwantlen in reference to the kwantlen first nations does not even have a wikipedia page 
 you are aware that unlike video sites such as youtube and google that copyright material on hulucom are legally loaded therefore there was no violation of copyright laws in this case 
 hulu links arent typically added plus the content is often restricted to certain geographic regions making it unsuitable 
 you know you sound like a decent personso why not help me with the entry instead of taking it down i do not consider it to be nonnotable N if i understand that right uN preceding 
 anon user please see 
 please dont leave deceptive edit summaries like or again 
 dont worry ros no edit to either of those pages in the last N months has not been scrutinized in full there is little point in leaving any edit summary at all i think i will just try to liven things up with my future ones to those pages 
 are you saying that movies and sports are not part of american culture uN 
 so you are trying to grain it more finely than culture thats at the national level uN 
 ok so you are looking for things that are uniquely american uN 
 this is part of a move to rationalise mos and its ancillary pages since they are so vulnerable to a lack of coordination and require very high maintenance when information is divided among them unnecessarily 
 re the revert fair enough thanks for the note and let the discussions begin 
 i have watchlisted this page for your response 
 thanks i will try to review this tomorrow and give some feedback however it is probably best to present the ideas at the talk page so that everyone can provide input 
 with asgardian removed 
 edit warring has resumed between these two users and they have also been using edit summaries to discuss their differences rather than talk pages i think it would be good to discuss the best availabe option for keeping the two of them away from each other please join me at 
 if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too you can find a list of file pages you have edited by clicking on the 
 i used numerous sources for 
 additional sources for roger brand were added months ago i just noticed several citation requests for tex blaisdell and just completed finding these references 
 not related to edit summaries but i didnt feel like making a new heading do not try to 
 dont flatter yourself i requested page protection and then went off to tend to real life business i this was the only scenario that i envisioned that didnt end with both of s blocked it was late at night on the east coast there was a N and a half hour lag in between the time i requested protection and the time it was granted i filed the request knowing that there was a very good chance that you would change the page to the before protection was enacted and i didnt care 
 thats nice hello haymaker this message is being sent to inform you that there currently is a discussion at 
 the bot removed it because it wasnt formatted correctly i fixed it 
 its been several hours since the ips last edits if they continue let me know and i will take a look 
 i 
 i will periodically check the edits of those two ips to see if they are causing disruption elsewhere if so i will block them both also let me know if you think other ips have been adding good material to the article if so then it might be better to unprotect and potentially play whackamole with the iphopper 
 hello fyi i will need to revert your move to 
 i didn know you couldnt use deleted names for new templates p anyway please move it to templatefp the point of it is to offer with a note or footnote or source in a very small space so that it can be used in a matrix with and so it is pretty much limited to N characters i was mixing p with n or f or s however it appears that fp is the only remaining option from other than sp i will create the docs to clarify what the template is fore i just left for dinner so i didnt have a chance ~ 
 tenebrae i would say that im fairly good at placing edit summaries for my edits especially when compared to most editors i would guess that at least N per cent of my edits have descriptive edit summaries so i was surprised to see your post to my talk page was there a particular edit that prompted this small request i will try to make that N per cent instead of N per cent 
 i see what you mean i did have a bad streak there on the N th with several in a row that did not have edit summaries thanks 
 another editor removed vandalism and you warned him for doing so you then proceeded to put the vandalism back and i had to fix it please watch closely what you are doing when using huggle thanks 
 im sorry if you didnt like the way i worded my above sentences you will find that i am a very frank and blunt person i tell it like it is instead of sugarcoating in my previous comment my first two sentences consisted of stating exactly what happened my next two sentences had a please and a thanks i never called you careless when using huggle i have been called so please dont be offended by my unemotional way of phrasing things if i sounded accusatory i did not intend to 
 and the same to you if you see me mess up please let me know 
 also if you feel that i have included any articles in the case which should not be included or that i failed to include any articles which should be included please let me know as i can change that before the case begins 
 hey there you should probably give the two of them a chance to speak before you add 
 yes but keep that in reserve as it will probably be worth adding later may be more appropriate in another time and place 
 hey there i almost forgot since they have both signed the rfm and since david posted a bunch on the talk page you may feel free to restore your comments at any time 
 i was wondering since you and dajorca are the only other significant contributors to this article would you be interested in being listed as a conominator if it goes to flc also im pretty sure you used and for the planets and pluto but i was wondering which sources you used for ceres and eris thanks 
 in you are listed as having made N revisions which places you second after me 
 actually looking at the history you dont appear to have supplied the figures for the list looks like i will have to track them down the hard way 
 ironically both ceres and eris were added by anonymous users so i will never learn where they got their info from 
 although i have got just about every issue through N i must confess my interest dropped out around N so i know more about spiderman titles before then however if theres anything needs checking from later im more than happy to pull and read anything else just ask cheers 
 caught me just about to head outside into the sunshine with a beer and sandwich in hand i may have said before im working on a database of the articles in the fanzines i have got but its kinda in the middle of everything else in life so is going to take time i have only begun to organise the fanzines in the past year im still missing around a N comics journals in an unopened box somewhere and the other week came across about a hundred comic buyers guides with the monthly golden age inserts that had stuff by goulart in them which i must have bought about N years ago but never read when its a bit more full i will upload it somehow as a resource so anyone can request items off to the garden cheers 
 nope thats not mine it shows an ip edit in the diff but the edit has a sig im too lazy to go to all that trouble should i request a cu 
 looking at the ips contribs i dont even see where we have run across each other i have reverted edits on alansohns and jnws user pages thats the only connection i see 
 it looks like they altered their welcome message to me as for the check user id just like to be known as an honest person and wouldnt object to the scrutiny 
 btw thanks for the revert im kinda stunned someone would go to that trouble to include me in their er milieu its made me forget my manners 
 cheers 
 hey less thanks for getting back to us my biggest concern is ros will initiate changes to terminology across swaths of pages that only really her and i edit and that i wont be able to contest them id like some sort of a clause that ros will not alter terms on these articles and she can certainly ask the same of me id also like to tone the initial N year installment down to N months 
 i think your initial concern is covered by the editing any article to the effect of undoing or manifestly altering a contribution by the other party wording but if you think it can be tightened up or better emphasised then feel free to suggest another wording as for the N year or N months issue i do not think a period that could be waited out would have the desired effect what is needed is for the two of you to get used to not looking to each others edits to see what might be reverted or amended N months is far too short a period for me although i would defer to a consensus between you roscelese and courcelles for a period shorter than a year 
 any movement on an admin you would like to nominate as the third involved administrator 
 i have always had a soft spot in my heart for 
 ckatz you have used your administrator privileges in a debate you have been involved in this is highly inappropriate for an administrator 
 sorry but you are completely mistaken removing the cheetah girls image is in no way whatsoever an administrative action does not involve any administrative tools and is based entirely on reading the 
 i stand corrected i presumed you had deleted the image and mistakenly missed the image in my contributions my apologies regardless i have reverted your removal because at least one other editor feels this is an appropriate addition i fully intend on creating more of these montages should the companions image pass and have no intention of creating more until this debate closes again my apologies for the mistaken conclusion on my part all the best 
 should be actually be 
 it has been a great collaboration originally i planned to have the sandbox deleted once we were done since there would be no reason to keep a sandbox around and all future edits would be done on the actual article now im thinking of keeping it around to show as an example when people claim that articles can never be fixed or they claim that wikipedia collaboration doesnt happen very well 
 although not the originator of this link having just followed it from the previous version of the article i am puzzled as to why you consider it spam the itv local page seems to have been largly taken from the nymr press release announcing the hlf grant award surely such information about immediate future developments on the nymr could be considered fair comment and directly relevant to the article in question i would certainly consider updating the 
 hello thanks for asking about this the removal should not be taken as a comment on the nymr in any way apologies if my edit summary wasnt clear enough unfortunately there has been an ongoing issue with spammed itv links over the past year this link was removed because it is one of many itv links that were added en masse by singlepurpose users and ips tracing back to itv itself please feel free to ask me if you have any other questions cheers 
 i had to dig to find two authoritative sources it was evident to me that both had contacted the family veitch said saturday which would make it june N not N 
 ten here is source for june N not N 
 here is the familys press release posted by williamsons publisher this confirms june N is correct 
 that looks authoritative and in fact seems where veitch at pulse got his information while its a blog it could probably get by as being from a nonpersonal source ie a publisher im a little wary but since this press release seems to be source of the journalistic report and mdash id hope rick veitch would have called a family source to confirm and mdash i personally could go with removing the june N or sources differ comment and making note of differing early reports down at the end until a mainstream source confirms 
 you do know that our 
 please see the sources provided 
 just want to say great job finding cites its a real pleasure working with you tenebrae N N june N 
 at the very least the croatian first league should be considered fully professional especially since biuN uN deviuN played for hajduk split one of the countrys top two clubs which is on par with many other professional clubs around europe 
 like i said the croatian first league is fully professional however there is a noteable difference between the budget of top clubs and lower level clubs as in all leagues 
 since you removed the cultfilm link i was wondering if you think there are any other links that could be removed a lot of them just seem to be generic horror fansites and not necessarily something that should be linked from on a horror website 
 thanks for the note i have trimmed the list added a link to the open directory projects horror category and cleaned it up cheers 
 thanks i appreciate it 
 no problem i have found that the open directory link can help resolve problem with excessive link buildup it is wikipediaendorsed and if editors want to add links they can be directed to the odp to submit the links there cheers 
 thanks for your time 
 thanks for the note the 
 ok so is it like an archive of other websites where the website itself is suitable use as a source 
 not a source in the reference sense but it is a organized directory of links urls are submitted to the volunteers for possible inclusion and are added to one or more categories dmoz is considered a preferred alternative to a long list of links in an article 
 ok thank you very much i really appreciate it 
 hey where you have been 
 other fun sockmasters on the australian scene remember premier or steakknife or the rightwing guy who could be relied upon for topics of indigenous australians and cannibalism monarchism and sir joh 
 what do you think about 
 david yorke on valium or cerepax perhaps 
 i have removed it again you reverted my action about a minute later as i was pasting the text in below where it is appropriate the reasons are clearly set out in its own subsection there it can be discussed and more information provided to users as a sudden addition to the lead of the rfc it has the effect of changing the text on which a large number of users have already declared their opinions this im sure you will agree is not appropriate nor is changing the text of a referendum after some of the electorate has already voted on it 
 tony you know full well it is perfectly relevant to the discussion furthermore it clearly indicates the time at which it was added and there is also a mention in metadiscussion for well discussion finally i might add that you did not extend the courtesy of notifying anyone about your rfc to begin with despite its overlap with one that was already under development so you can hardly complain about what is appropriate 
 i have reverted your removal again tony you may wish to read 
 id appreciate it if you discussed this first before launching in with changes given that theres a need to cooperate and diffuse the situation at mosnum talk 
 having said that i have now done the opposite and implemented the changes it seemed easier just to do it please let me know if you object 
 please note that i have removed your tag from 
 the nomination was incomplete so i completed it for you you didnt offer a deletion rationale so you will want to stop by the nomination to give a reason 
 yes i realize there is mostly plot as of right now but instead of just deleting it i say we should add more to the article until it has the same standards and any of the other heroes characters with their own articles just making it a redirect is the eay way out i dont mind putting in some effort to making a good article 
 ah i see what you mean very well then i will get to work on adding that kind of info to the page and the next time i change it it will contain all the parts you mentioned properly sourced of course thanks for the help 
 i will review it again when im not falling asleep 
 moved back but maybe you can fix the dupe refs 
 ckatz iuN m sorry for falsely accusing you of collaborating with tznkai on deleting an entire rfc indeed he managed to pull that one off all by his little lonesome and did not do so at your behest i misunderstood what tznkai meant when he said he jumped in at the request of uN canother adminuN d well that uN cother adminuN d wasnuN t you iuN ve that i was wrong and apologized there i have no problem with your behavior as an admin i am sorry for thinking you put him up to it and for falsely stating as much on the ani my bad 
 greg im uncertain as to how there could be any confusion leading to the an post given that i told you pointblank that i had not contacted anyone when we discussed this two days ago however i do appreciate the retraction here and at the an board in the spirit of putting this behind us i have tweaked my post at an accordingly and am willing to consider this closed if you are 
 totally closed 
 wikipedia also doesnt cover those sort of errors virtually every film ever made has them and they are really just a form of trivia generally speaking we only note details such as those when someone else has made a note of it such as if a film critic takes the producers to task for sloppy errors 
 they are interesting for sure but unfortunately they are not notable in the context of an encyclopaedic treatment of the subject now again if some of these become notable through observations of thirdparty sources they would then be suitable for inclusion for example there may be an army official who comments on the errors in the war scenes alternatively the producers might note that they purposefully changed some aspect in order to achieve a certain dramatic effect that would help to give the article a greater realworld context hope this helps if i ever come across such observations id be happy to pass them along to you 
 hi in you left a sentence fragment dangling at the end of your addition if you look at the bottom of the first passage of righthand red text you will see it says he returned to dc to give indefinite notice to weisinger but weisinger ordered him to leave immediately and i was back at marvel less than an hour after i first left and had a

 seems very clued up for a newbie sockcheck at isle one please 
 im aware of it thanks for letting me know earlier its difficult to tell whether its kapitalist or stravin or watchover at this point

 what are the issues with the files 
 i will fix the files this weekend job is killing me this week 
 stifle with regards to this site i have been reviewing the users contribution history the site itself and the quality of online references to the site im not sure that we need to remove this one from the blacklist as the article appears to be purely for promotional purposes thoughts 
 well the addition wasnt logged in the first place so its not clear why it was added to start with lets leave it for the moment and check if the article gets deleted or if theres spam refs added 
 also globalreviewer please ugh 
 i can already tell you that ones unrelated thats just the earlier ip who tried to add that thing on zed seselja i think the weather over that way is bringing out the wild and weird in people 
 hi there just a note to inform you that i deleted 
 thanks for the note both are appreciated 
 i didnt know you were going to attend nycc do you live in the area or are you just visiting email me so we can maybe get together that day hang etc 
 so how did the con go did you photograph anyone i created a commons page for the N nycc so you have some place to add yours 
 initially i had mixed feelings having covered the big apple con a week earlier i was irritated at how overwhelmingly crowded it was and how hard it was to get from a to b there by sunday once i was done getting the photos i wanted of the exhibitors floor i figured out how to navigate the friggin thing and decided to stay mostly in artists alley and make only minimal or no attempts to photograph the panel discussions the dumbass way that the artist alley tables were lettered was also aggravating but all in all i got more photos than at big apple N uploaded big apple pics vs N uploaded nycc pics 
 quacketyquack indeed 
 hes been strangely silent since his original postings maybe his computer has gone homeless 
 for what its worth i have brought up this editors linkspam on ani and i mentioned you name so im letting you know the thread is at 
 just out of curiosity how does that link violate 
 its elN links mainly intended to promote a website see external link spamming 
 but how do you know that thats the main intention if the site has a podcast of a panel discussion in which adams and sale are speaking doesnt that add legitimate value to the wikipedia article does it really make a difference if the audio file is hosted on one site or another 
 my biggest clue about the editors intention is that they didnt respond to tenebraes outreach but continued adding the link nonetheless also most podcasts are relatively lowvalue links regardless uN 
 i just wanted to draw your attention to a note i left you that got archived while you were away 
 thanks for reposting this i forgot to extend the archive time limit before the break i will try to take a look at the template over the next few days as i catch up on stuff 
 thank you for considering it 
 the first one especially could stand to have his user page wiped and protected 
 my pet squirrel has had its fill of this nut but you can do with it what you will seriously im not so sure about N simply because it tracks to a different city some distance away but that geolocate may not be foolproof and the numbers do seem too close to be a coincidence 
 okay so yeah its possible that thats his intent but i even if it were i dont see why the file has less value are interviews with blp subjects not considered valid els general 
 theres a bigger picture here is it right and proper and mdash does it do wikipedia good in the long run and mdash to have everyone in the world post links to their own sites wikipedia is not a collection of links the links that are added must have value and purpose the burden of proof so to speak is on the person adding the link its not as if the podcast will disappear or people wont be able to find it if its not posted in wikipedia

 why did you the long edit summaries gadget to the user interface section it doesnt really change the user interface uN 
 its really more of an interface tweak than an editing tool the editing gadgets are specialpurpose tools such as twinkle and wiked that offer a lot of features not a big deal of course but it seems a better fit where it is now

 thanks for the feedback from what i could determine in past discussions about the mail it is considered to be semireliable not tabloidish but also not entirely trustworthy when it comes to tabloidstyle details about personal details given the vagueness of the text it seems best not to use the information without a second source to verify thoughts 
 as with the

 thanks for the input i do however think it possible in this day of cell phone cameras and mass media for these images to be taken i think it is a matter of do we believe it or not the problem is while these marvel movies do receive a lot attention filming locations are still not covered by lot of rs sources like variety or the hollywood reporter and often lazily reported by others which just regurgitate the story without doing their own work like you i feel most other editors would decline to include it so i suppose we should continue to wait 
 you are a journalist that explains a lot i wasnt so much interested in the images for use in the article as to use them to validate the story itself that filming took place in culross however if we got permission from the copyright holder to place them in the commons i wouldnt mind using them as the small amount of encyclopedic value they have would then outweigh the nonfree media infringement that brings me to my next question what is difference between our commons editors and independent sources since we just take their images at face value 
 thanks for the research nice work btw have you considered becoming an admin because you have both temperment and thoughtfullness to make a good one 
 i usually respond on other talk pages but since the thread you responded to involves more than one person i will keep the discussion only on my talk page 
 also please put 
 im not sure why you are asking but of course i like having rollback again i havent devoted a whole lot of time to vandalfighting but i have been doing more than i was when i didnt have the tool 
 oh i was just asking because i was curious that was all i sometimes check up on people i have granted rollback to to see if they are happy with it no problems here 
 i just want to let you know i merged the

 regarding the kyle baker coi you should have alerted someone that he dropped a N rd partys private number on his talk page its gone now all but totally but still it should have been noted when he did it 
 it may just be that im a little more antsy about breaches of privacy also why im not too keen on the spouse or partner or relations fields on the biography infoboxes 
 thanks so much for your support and kind words on my rfa frankly i knew you would want to put your pawprint on that page and had been unsuccessfully trying all week to figure out how i could draw your attention to it without being a selfpromoting spammer im glad you got to it on your own and again appreciate the nice things you have said both there and many other times best regards 
 i was told at nearly the last minute too i would never have forgiven anyone concerned if i didnt even get to put in a kudo do you think you will make N i dont watch rfa or your talk page as closely as i should clearly you are not a selfpromoting spammer if you write to someone who wanted to conominate you i have never nominated anyone yet sigh always a bridesmouse 
 tell you what you can nominate me for arbcom in november wait no thats selfnoms i will have to keep thinking 
 just keep doing with the mop what you have been encouraging others to do when you havent had it that will be more than enough reward

 please read through the talk page archives as it will help to explain this common misunderstanding main character status is decided by the network and the series producer not by the opinions of fans or wikipedia editors the roles of sylar and ando were not considered main roles in the first season but both actors were promoted to that status in the second season 
 dont worry about this i am sure it was unintended this is just a pointer for the future to try to think of the big picture which is that we dont want to be repeating that kind of info anywhere on wp making a link to the problematic post would be a much better idea 
 thank you also for his block it will give me time to go in and actually find citations for certain things with kind regards 
 yes i saw you had redacted personal info which was great im not sure removing the name would be enough though it was the claim in the content and the association with a living person that was problematic as peace himself knew because he changed it to dated at one point another time immediately report these sorts of things to 
 i do i hadnt been aware of 
 no problem i have watchlisted it and feel free to contact me on my talkpage if you notice problems elsewhere 
 hes making personal claims about the baker family including a medical claim about one of the baker children i think that really crosses a line as well if hes genuinely so close to the family i believe theres a

 sorry i wasnt around to help but you did the right thing by contacting oversight and it looks like happy melon has stepped in to help with some redacting as well as with some strong words of advice i will continue to keep an eye on the matter lets hope that it pays off 
 i reverted it again and i think it should be left there and discussed on the articles talk page since several editors have agreed that the show is extremely similar to the work of 
 please discuss this further on the articles talk pagei refuse to talk to you directly until the matter is resolved with a consensus of other editors 
 i never said i owned the article all i said was i started that section further posts on my page will be considered harrassment and reported to a moderator 
 yeah well you may be a moderator that doesnt mean you dont have to follow the rules too i created a discussion of the disputed content 
 no you cant tell me what to do so im going to leave the info up i put a header on the section that says the content has been disputed and invited everyone to discuss and reach a consensus please 
 i moved the disputed section to the talk page thank you for reasoning with me and not N rring me have another cookie 
 ben thanks for your note i would be curious to know who you emailed as there is no head of music at wikipedia beyond that the external links guideline generally suggests that we do not link to sites just because they mention a particular subject there must be a specific benefit to the article many many websites publish reviews but that does not mean that every review site should be listed is there any particular reason why you feel sun on the sand is especially notable 
 thanks again for the kind words and the two cents over on j grebs talk page btw are you on facebook if so look me up search for my real name theres a few people with the same name on fb but my profile pic is the one with the illustration of an archway 
 to each his own im an aspiring illustrator so someday hopefully soon i will be in that industry myself as the name issue well its in my photographs file name 
 could you please userfy 
 its already at 
 lol wow and what a typo yes the word not is definitely missing im fixing it 
 just drop by to wish you and your family a happy thanksgiving uN 
 ditto what he said above 
 hi there i noticed that you are both an admin and a member of wikiproject bc so i was hoping you could help me out heres the scoop at the end of january the 
 arghh i tried this as a nonadmin and duhh it doesnt work ckatz i will go to an for help now so watch there for overlaps if you are trying to fix it dont know what i was thinking 
 ok i think i have it all in place the parent article is now at 
 done thanks for sorting that out cheers 
 regards 
 hi i am not a frequent editor of the article so my edit may very well be questionable i just wanted to include a lone reference in a commented out area right below the reference section 
 our N friend without even joining the discussion on talk i have removed them twice your turn i think its best to show that its not just me 
 reverted unfortunately this is a tough one to stop as the ip changes so frequently thanks 
 i noticed you reverted a couple edits of this user adding that article to see also sections if you might have guessed he created that article a couple days ago im not going to argue the appropriateness of that article right now but if you look at his 
 thanks for the note i have cleaned up the unnecessary ones and also left a note for the editor 
 you are correct and mdash the afd notice should not have been removed from the 
 the process was not followed in this case however i suggest that you take note of the discussion on the afd page the standard for inclusion of players is not their team standing etienne barbara meets the standards of notability for athletes it is likely that if you continue to nominate such articles for deletion this will be taken as bad faith and 
 i saw that easyblockjs was giving you trouble was this problem fixed when werdna tweaked the update or does something still need to be done uN 
 comment user seems to request unblock in 
 thanks so much for listening 
 just a quick update i was wondering if youd allow me to put the gruvis malt article back up with a notability flag the problem is i dont know everything about gruvis malt but there are people that do however by removing the article entirely theres no way that anyone will be able to contribute what they know would you allow this thanks 
 hey update number N i put the page back up on 
 fair enough and your efforts are certainly appreciated i have as requested posted an afd and added a note outlining your efforts and your interest in seeking input cheers 
 thanks man i really appreciate you keeping open minded about this you rock 
 thanks good work on sourcing more material to support the article 
 hello and thanks for the note unfortunately what you have to remember is that wikipedia is not a site for introducing products or for any sort of promotional campaigns in order to qualify for an article a product has to demonstrate notability independently of the mere fact it exists if you have any reviews from suitable sources that can support the product as being distinct or exceptional that would help 
 i could also change the colors add labels etc 
 anyway if i were to suggest colors the armm areas remain in red the areas intended to be part of armm in yellow and the other areas be in brown just like other regional locator maps just retain all the exisiting provincial boundaries in the map if you could likewise include the shade of malaysian territory so as not to make it appear that the vicinity is all water that will be perfect 
 uploaded a new map 
 the map is already perfect i think you just forgot to put the labels on palawan and the cities though or will it appear too crowded or lets just let go of the dots xdc 
 oh my im not sure how i forgot palawans label i think it would be a bit crowded with the city dots so i will just remove them new map uploaded 
 this is perfect i will soon come out with an article about this thanks xdc 
 great 
 i would state my objection to your repeated attempt to remove the fact that there are no specifications nor user survey kindly do not redelete unless you can demonstrate the existence of same i also note that is the third time this content has been removed by you consider yourself warned per 
 i have repeatedly asked you to explain why you feel it is necessary to add that detail twice within close proximity while we disagree on its validity in the rfc i at least compromised and left one instance i would ask the same courtesy in return 
 please do not delete useful content education was a major omission from this page and the way forward is to list all the schools not to delete the first that has been added 
 actually if you look at other pages the standard is not to list individual schools as you did i have expanded the section but the individual schools are adequately listed on the linked north vancouver school district article 
 fair enough however can you provide a reference that supports your assertion that l and o guest stars are primarily from that world as opposed to the broader one 
 the subsection stylistic touches does not mandate that all guest stars are from the new york theater world rather that this is a recurring trend that helps identify the series and give its feel and style 
 sorry i wasnt clear enough do you have anything to verify that of the l and o guests who have a theatrical background most are from legitimate theatre otherwise there is no reason to use the more specific term as opposed to the more inclusive theatre 
 sure i guess it wouldnt be too much trouble to make a map like that perhaps something like 
 i guess 
 ok as for the map showing the number of representatives per province is this what you had in mind this is based on data at 
 wow that was fast great yeah its exactly what i have in mind adding the labels will be best will you be able to carve the city of manila from rizal province and adjust the latters boundary to show valenzuela as part of bulacan it wouldnt require an inset for manila would it maripipi island in biliran is part of leyte isnt it or that will be very tedious xdc 
 alright uploaded a new version with labels and fixes for the things you mentioned i didnt realize valenzuela used to be part of bulacan you have a good eye for these little details p 
 you are so good this is perfect thanks i apologize for paying too much attention in the details im a selfconfessed oc hehehe so shall i see the maps progress for every congress xdc 
 seventh congress separation of kalingaapayao benguet and ifugao from mountain province division of agusan into agusan del norte and agusan del sur camiguin separated from misamis oriental xdc 
 i have included a coi tag on 
 thanks for looking into that i will keep an eye on them as well 
 hi i tried to talk to the user who nominated the tag but he just reverts any edits and wont respond can you tell me what you think is wrong with the template i copied the links from the template 
 also i know you reverted the edits until a consesus is reached i just am looking for some guidance in this matter on how to make this proper and how to proceed to clean these articles up they are a mess 
 dont understand i followed the procedure and reached a consensus with the nominating user and he said feel free to add the template now what else needs to be done im probably gonna give up on cleaning these up too much effort to do something small 
 thanks for your question the note was not regarding the information you added to that particular article where you used the interview as a reference it was about the other seven links you added to various external links sections which did not meet the 
 thanks N th congress map is already perfect except maripipi island of biliran is back to samar again xdc mindoro was officially split in N however each of occidental and oriental already had their own representatives in the N nd congress i guess we just have to recognize that 
 not sure if you noticed but im done with all those p 
 oh wow you are finished thanks sorry i didnt pay attention to my talk page thanks a lot 
 by the way i went as far as going personally to the comelec main office to photocopy election records to verify the list of elected members of congress since N just to iron out any difference between the N sources i already have that show representatives from provinces which were not yet created at the time of their representation the materials i have photocopied are about an inch thick i will just sort them out on my free time i will tell you any discrepancy so the maps may be adjusted if needed if you have the time for it xdc 
 wow you are way more dedicated to researching sources than me i suppose its possible to place all the raw data you got online in a different location than wikipedia works by the philippine government is in the public domain that would help election researchers a lot 
 please tell me how 
 hello could you have a look at 
 okay it seems that this user can edit the page because the block allows them to eidt their own talk page is it possible to protect that page 
 thats fine thanks 
 as i said i have found three of these types of errors in two articles 
 tip you can see what the footnote will look like by putting at the bottom of the section while you preview just remember to take it back out before you save 
 and reviewing the articles you mention i strongly suspect that you are talking about the bluelighted hyperlinks to external sites normally these have a little doublesquare icon just following indicating that they are external links in internet explorer at least when the bluelink wraps around a line the little icon disappears and there is a space instead if you stretch your screen out so that the bluelink is all on one line the icon will reappear or you can call microsoft and ask them to fix their software 
 thank you franamax lotsa luk with that final suggestion i know some people who have been trying to get microsoft to fix outlook express for several years nowwith no end in sight the rest of your reply seems to be chock full of useful info and i look forward to making time for checking it out thoroughly again thank you so much for the tips and nbsp 
 at least thanks to you 
 you do realize that you can make redirects as if it were a normal article and you dont have to clutter up your move log right 
 aight 
 hi again anonemouse im still plugging away at the big project and doing what i can on the littler ones in the meantime i have come across one problem just now though one of the articles i have been using as a reference source in tokyo journal appears to have been taken down i have got the article saved but how do i use it as a reference 
 ok nevermind on this one anyway i have found a reference to the article in a print source the july N issue of the concern still lingers though what do i do in case im not able to track down a print copy of a good legitimate web article which is subsequently removed 
 removed articles can sometimes be found using the 
 thanks olessi i did try that site but wasnt able to locate it guess i will have to learn how to use it better 
 just plug the into find this url at the hope this helps 
 the photo puts more substance on the article 
 welcome xdc 
 those ethnicity categories are about to be deleted and when they are the persons ethnicity will go with them i am just trying to retain the information on wikipedia 
 appreciate it thanks i have jettisoned firefox for now as its been getting beaten up by the scripts lately and have moved to safari because though its a bit slower its turned out to be significantly more stable thanks for the info 
 if you have firefox or N it will probably be ok there other browsers that are probably faster than safari opera is one 
 why did you delete the quote from emilio aguinaldo qoute is from 
 im working on the article i dont think it should be the beggining of the article 
 ergyes in a way but its also punjabispeaking and frenchspeaking and germanspeaking the proliferation of chinese cultural colonialism categories articles and content is quite appalling at times and to object against it winds up having bad things said about you for criticizing it there was an attempt shortly after the influx began in the N s to make mandarin an official language in bc because theres so many mandarinspeakers here now when it wasnt even the historical dialect of chinese found in bc see re the prolfieration of multiple articles with overlapping or selfreinforcing content very much like the plethora of articlesthanks for taking that out and worth noting that vancouver is neither a country nor a territory(in colonial bc the benevolent assn documents refer to british columbia not as a british possession or province but as the colonies of tang where tang means nonqing chinasorry to rant i jsut get pd by this stuff i used to be active in talkpoliticstibet and have seen so much of this kind of thinking or overreaching it gets my back upif that cat were to remain then respective italian german etc other categories should exist looseygoosey interepretations of what constitutes are chinatown or a koreatown have similar problemswere you around when someone tried to label robson and denman koreatown because of the location of three restaurants never mind who else lived around there 
 i just took the same category off 
 further to previous see and acompanying talkpage

 fixed dbti to dbtc 
 i would seriously warn you against such actions as they could erupt into edit warring im not going to do such because i dont want to find myself in violation of 
 please note that the change occurred prior to the discussion not after it as well it is the other articles that are out of line with the wider convention across television articles i have provided several links that explain this

 regarding the equal signs mess up with the template invocation escaping the equal signs resolves the issue p uN 
 or so i thought i see the issue now i will see if i can fix it uN

 lesson learned is our friend for urls containing equal signs embedded within template calls compare to which is useful for embedding vertical bars in template calls uN 
 yeah i live in greenvale im in uni this year and went to aitken college and st carlos im also of italian descent good to see someone else from our great suburb on this site cheers 
 well i couldnt be bothered writing it myself so yeah i got it off the greenvale primary school website im busy with articles about the simpsons at the moment so if i do fix it up it wont be soon 
 by the way 
 ckatz as a matter of goodwill i thought id let you know that greg is going to post a significantly updated version of the statement against probably in the next day 
 thanks for the notice im offline until sunday night so i suppose i will see it then cheers 
 i found just one error so far in the articles in davao del norte according to this san isidro belongs to the same district as that of its mother municipalities asuncion and kapalong adds a bit of confusion as it still displays the incorrect designations for the two districts of the province i could have moved it myself but im afraid of making errors in the population figures keep up the good work 
 by the way just a general rambling isnt it peculiar that cotabato city still falls under the label of N st district of maguindanao i mean san jose del monte and antipolo both have their names on their district designations even though they are merely component cities of bulacan and rizal respectively why the comelec made an exception to an independent component city boggles me 
 the maps are almost finished with just minor adjustments for davao city and metro manila pending i came across the comelecs education and information department website that had it divides pasig and pasay into two districts each are these among the newer congressional districts created since the last election by the way the document does not divide taguig and marikina into districts although paraxfN aque and valenzuela were 
 if you have some reason to object to the latest version of my addition feel free to say so yourself on the talk page but i dont see why you would since theres no reason to object to the latest version of my addition and you shouldnt presume to make edits on behalf of franamax if he wanted to respond he could do it himself 
 shaheenjim the edit is obviously disputed given that more people have objected to it than have supported inclusion as such per any number of wiki quidelines the onus is on you to achieve consensus first rather than to restore the material without consensus 
 they objected to the old version of the edit and i addressed all those objections in the new version no one has raised any objection that applies to the new version if they have an objection they should state it on the talk page im going to have to ask you to stop your edit war and use the talk page to discuss your objections per wikipedia policy 
 umm would you care to explain how i am edit warring last time i checked 
 on several occasions now i have asked you to post your objections on the talk page if you have any per wikipedia policy but you keep deleting the edit without listing a single objection to it on the talk page thats edit warring the only thing you have seemed to say is that you think other people might have objections to it if they have any objections to it they can state it themselves they dont need you deleting it for them 
 i have been quite clear about the need for more discussion on this text which is a valid reason for removing material i have been equally clear in moving it to the talk page rather than just deleting it as you claim given the objections of others to your restoration of the material in its present form that seems the appropriate course of action 
 you say that you want to discuss the objections to it but i have asked you several times now to list your objections and you havent listed a single one again if other people want to post objections to it they can do that themselves they dont need you to presume to object or delete or move things on their behalf lets be clear do you have any objections of your own or are you just presuming to speak on the behalf of others 
 what do you think 
 by the way thank you very much for the barnstar i really appreciate it 
 also according to the comelec document i mentioned before the two barangays of post proper northside and southside still belong to makatis N nd congressional district as ra N did not mention these barangays as part of the new legislative district of taguig yet i took these into account on the maps i have made so far 
 itd be awesome if you could find out for sure whether those two barangays are indeed part of the congressional district of taguig city before i multpily the mistakes i think it would require another ra to amend the original taguig cityhood charter to include the barangays in dispute to the district in the meantime those barangays are now administratively part of taguig city i would think that residents would now vote for city officials of taguig but not congressional representatives of taguig yet 
 will do only that it might take a few more days i hope thats ok in the following weeks i might be able to only make the district locator maps for metro manila with the others to be made in the summer 
 this is fantastic would it be possible to do a political map showing which districts are controlled by what party based on the N election results 
 hello i was wondering what the status of the featured article review for this article is since the review page is named archiveN is this active 
 yes it is active the archiveN opens up automatically when a far or fac is started it is a new way the fac people have started using that makes it easiler for them to archive after the process is over since an archive is already opened they dont have to archive it when it is closed hope that explains it thats the best i can do anyway the far for 
 hello ckatz i just noticed your stated intention to restore this users userpage though im not sure if you realise i have already deleted most of its history and made a note about this at ani i think he made it very clear he did not want the userpage at this time i would personally want to wait until you have made some other progress with this user before restoring the deleted information however i will probably miss out on most of the ensuing discussion so i thought id just mention this now and leave you to adjust the page or user as you see fit 
 well i was going to say thats fine in fact i will go revert myself on his user page now but if the the history has been deleted i will leave it for just now depending on how zzuuzz feels though im ok with removing the indefblock notice 
 either blanking or deletion is fine with me as i say it seems clear to me that the user does not want the page and i think this is a courtesy we should afford

 theres a lesserknown idea about about taxing the movement of money 
 yeah sure i can if he is around ten that means im older then him d whats the editors name is he a newcomer or is he just an ip 
 i checked out his edits it is in a way strange especially to see a newcomer join a group as if he isnt a new user at all no i dont see how his edits are similar to mine since i work on traditional animated or computer animated or vg and cg topics while he works on financial field and a couple of other random contributions im just not sure what i can really help him with 
 i went months as an ip not having to know anybody else my age but if he would like to know other people his age he better go to 
 perhaps its a simple as me doing something wrong but my problem is that the function does not format dates such as N march properly on my screen displays as march N N it seems that the function must be applied to a dmy or mdy sequence to function date ranges come out with no transformation please refer to 
 i was upset you reverted me without bothering to respond to the messages i left for you here and on the article talk however tony seems to think there is no bug because its billed to work on full dates so im cool with that and i would apologise 
 thanks for the note sorry too i thought i had left you a note but it seems i didnt must have been the late hour thanks again 
 thanks for the note the text doesnt seem necessary for the main articles about these provinces and states i have only removed it from the more general articles it seems better suited to the ones i left such as those on the lakes themselves and on tourism 
 oops removed one from a lake article i have restored that 
 no not spam for sure however id suggest giving editors a chance to respond at the talk page where another editor moved the text it was one of the us states if i recall correctly as for the idea of providing tourism information there is a difference between tourism and encyclopedic content believe me i can understand the importance of the lakes to the local states and provinces after all british columbias tourism industry is one of its top employers however the main article (
 as i said the material was removed because it did not seem necessary for the main article it is better suited to a subarticle instead as well other editors have questioned the appropriateness of the text for similar reasons sandygeorgia removed it from the

 im not the greatest fan of moving reponse comments on polling pages (eg to 
 ryan has stated that he does not want threaded comments in the for or against areas hence his cleanup earlier today 
 you may as well ban all response comments as no one is going to scroll down there to see what they are about 
 ckatz is busy so i will take the liberty of responding i dont think you understand what those tags are for your edits were removed because they lacked proper sources please read 
 thanks for the reply i would like to get the dataset on who was serving where when ie the congressmen for each district for each term if it is not too much to ask you can you send it through my mail thanks 
 okay i will just copy them from here thanks 
 it clearly says advisory are you sure you are reading your sources correctly strike two

 it will just be an unending list it doesnt end with that in the book perhaps just mention a few political families in the philippine politics page make a subsection about dynasties not everyone is noteworthy 
 we can do that but knowing him by now hindi titigil yan hanggat hindi nya nakukuha ang gusto nya we might need to do something else 
 on second thought your proposal seems to be more tenable lets study our options carefully so that it will pass on the first nomination try sending me an email and lets talk about itmy 
 i appreciate the effort and switching the images was a great idea it does look appropriate there next to the facebiting stuff i just think captions should be short and basically just refer to the picture not necessarily to relate the picture to the text unless there is an obvious direct connection others may disagree 
 also apologies if my edit comment was too sarcastic 
 i am a human being not a 
 thanks i have always wondered how to do that 
 just a bit of warning although the google maps base map looks more detailed there are minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies with it especially regarding smaller islands inland waters and newer reclaimed land sometimes lakes or water features appear where there only are rice paddies or do not appear at all where they should several islands in the spratly and turtle groups that are never covered by water even in high tide are not even shown while the outline of the features in the scarborough group makes them look bigger than they are in actuality overall it is somewhat impressive for its detail which may look great in mediumsized thumbnails but are painful to colourbyclick using just ms paint 
 oh cool you screen captured from google maps too haha high five d 
 im seeing lots of reverts with regards to doctor who articles and 
 hey thanks for the offer from what i have just read there seems to be a dispute as to how to number the individual stories and whether the shada story should be counted the consensus appears to be with the existing numbering given that a similar renumbering by an ip was reverted a short time ago we will see what happens after the editor reaches the end of the list if her restarts some other action may be required 
 apologies the story numbers were out of sync with a recent issue of doctor who magazine and indeed publicity tied into the N th story of doctor who which just went out this past weekend i thought i was doing a service as my understanding was that the numbering that had been used on wikipedia was arbitrary and was based on older reference books i also was led to believe that the primary reason for the change not occuring yet was the amount of time involved so i thought i would assist in the project to update the story numbers so as to be more in sync with the official bbc numbering as you have suggested i have put the call out on the doctor who talk page again i am sorry if i have overstepped my bounds i was just trying to help the articles be less confusing to users of the wikipedia articles 
 duly noted i too will make it my mission to close merger discussions that i feel are not going the way i like 
 walter thats not it at all there had not been any discussion since march N and there was no apparent consensus to merge perhaps cmjcN should have requested outside advice but the fact that he closed it after N days of inactivity is not comparable to your stated intent to close merger discussions that i feel are not going the way i like 
 whatever 
 this behavior seems directly to contradict proper editor behavior on avoiding attacks of other users on article discussion pages it seems to have been spurred by travbs inability to prove his sockpuppet case and this is his last attempt to discredit and run 
 did i mention aieee i guess not anyway the two sections you mention seem to only duplicate other information already on that talk page so they are redundant and heavily misspelled but not really anything new they are clearly not nice but taking it to 
 aieee pretty much sums it up im a strong believer in making nice and working together however travb posted this information after mobile N attempted the very same thing by making a statement working on the firestone page together on his user page this was referred to on the sockpuppet page you closed he ignored it by all appearances he refuses to let the sockpuppet thing go and has no inclination to even attempt to join in a collaborative effort on the pages in question regardless i dont want escalation but he has been in the past for apparently going overboard in arguments over edits and or or users ultimately i feel its unfair and uncivil for this behavior to continue regardless thank you again for your opinion it cant be all fun having to deal with two sides squabbling 
 just a note i dropped over to his talk page and made a request that he try and work towards collaborating hopefully that will lead to a good resolution thanks again 
 thanks for the suggestion about spelling errors mr mouse thanks for your hard work i would never want to be an admin because as an admin you are forced to make tough decisions and you are always going to make someone unhappy 
 hello thanks for your sterling work with this rather stubborn editor i noticed that they have also created 
 actually no need to worry 
 i probably shouldnt be amused but 
 {{#if or 
 the way to look at this is that wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a place where people can get free highvalue links to their web sites the information at 
 hello ckatz while i do see where you are going with this and what you are trying to imply but i think that the vancouver or bellingham templates should be merged into one template for mainly two reasons the first being the detroit and windsor templates are one with both american and canadian locals in one template it would make sense to put bellingham in the vancouver template as bellingham is closer to vancouver than seattle the second being kvos is not carried on cable anywhere south of skagit county i believe and both kbcb and kvos have poor over the air penetration in seattle and its northern suburbs while technically kvos is an american station most of its ads and the programming is target to canadians and little programming is targeted to americans that is why i believe the bellingham section in the seattle template should be in the vancouver template thanks 
 the difference here is that this is a british columbia template not just a vancouver one there are some other reasons i will add more later to better explain but have to go offline for a short while 
 i dont really see a big difference between detroit or windsor and vancouver or bellingham in both situations there are two cities on opposite sides of the border with one being larger than the other both areas have tv stations on either side of the border except with the vancouver or bellingham situation a station from the smaller city in a foreign country serves the larger city please reply as soon as possible thanks 
 i have created some templates regarding this situation please take a look at them and comment on which proposal do you think is the best 
 just a headsup i moved your article to 
 thats fine travatore 
 you removed with a comment of the article was published in 
 saw your info thanks let me know when you have time to write it all up so there is some context 
 apparently cocc is in fact blacklisted because of abuse by some users as someone explained to me on the blacklist page i think wwwcoroicocc is eligible for whitlisting though 
 i noticed that you have added nonfree content to 
 fasach nua you know full well that the images were not added instead they were restored from deletions by you all of which were without any form of explanation whatsoever again as per what i and others have told you repeatedly you would probably find that your concerns receive a more positive response if you took the time to engage in discussion rather than just deleting without even explaining why you are doing so 
 the invitation for you to revert the addition of copyrighted material without a claim of fairuse remains open and i would encourage you to accept it 
 please do not misrepresent the situation you deleted material you did not explain why you did not provide an edit summary and you refuse to participate in any form of discussion about the deletions fn im presuming that your intentions are good however you must keep in mind that the behaviour i have described above if taken by an ip or an editor without a good track record would be considered vandalism please reconsider your refusal to explain your edits i am certainly not the only editor to take issue with this problem 
 in addition to reviewing your edits 
 you may wish to review my previous post that is where i specifically stated fn im presuming that your intentions are good 
 hi ckatz could i ask you again to unprotect the dates section of the mos you seem to have protected it indefinitely even though there are no issues that i can see and you were involved in editing it is there any reason normal editing cant resume 
 hello you asked about this a while back and i replied on the dates talk page asking if people wanted the section unprotected following the request there was no consensus to unlock the section especially while the arbitration case is still under way hope this helps 
 just a comment here there is an arbcom case reaching its late stages so normal editing should resume soon in any case and there is an template available to accomplish consenus changes via the talk page continued protection still helps to prevent any of the protagonists at the ac case from prejudicing themselves further 
 do you have a specific airport that the gps code would be in i added it to the template but i really have no idea how it would look and should update the documentation page a bit more thanks 
 ok thanks i added it but then realised that the icao and gps codes are usually but not always the same 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our 
 the data is in paper i wish i could have the time to encode them 
 do you have an online source for their component towns or cities or barangays so i can finish the different district articles 
 which ones do you need 
 the articles which dont have cities or towns yet 
 i will send you a file soon about it 
 please note this is an automatic notification by a 
 we cannot copy content directly from myspace even when sourced the meat of the blog entry has already been integrated into the section its supposed to be in 
 theres a difference between quoting someone and copying the entire blog thats a violation of copyright the article references the blog entry links to it and tells a reader that zach braff has confirmed he will be in N episodes of season N nothing more is needed 
 hello dustimagic i just got tangled up in your 
 sorry thanks yeah i need to subst my message i do that with test warnings but i think i forgot to with my welcome message i will fix that right away thanks for letting me know 
 oh yeah thanks for looking it out i will make the needed correction soon 
 sorry mate the pow function is not implemented in the mediawikis parserfunctions extension or even any other extension the annual growth rates need to be computed by hand 
 exponentiation is supported in one extension but that extension is not installed in wikipedia 
 the article seems to contain too many unverified claims concerning the fact that this is your scope and you are biggest contributor to the article i ask you to help me verify these claims it will be a very big disappointment to see the article demoted due to this problem 
 its not and thank you for pointing it out per our 
 the mos has not been changed regarding delinking of dates and the committee has sat on their collective butt for N months doing nothing with their temporary injunction linking dates like the date a show aired or the date a sneaker was released to the market serves absolutely no purpose these are not historic dates not linking those dates was a good policy my question is how long will this temporary injunction be in effect at some point temporary stops being temporar and becomes policyand policy cant simply be changed the way they did it 
 i prodded the arbcom about this issue the poll on the topic was concluded over a month ago and the results were overwhelmingly to keep the standard as written N votes compared to a combined total of N for the other N options this should have already been handled 
 why are we removing another editors comments how does 
 locke im undoing your action and asking you to please stay out of it if there is a problem either way you are best off allowing the clerks to handle it that is their job after all they will either revert hwvN s actions or remove pmandersons comments i mean you no disrespect but there really is no need for you to intervene 
 thank you i realise that my of the original comments could have been handled better i guess i should have asked pmanderson to voluntarily remove his comments before taking action im learning too 
 im failing to see the logic in this if its up to the clerks then shouldnt it be up to the clerks to aremove the comment in the first place not up to hwvN to claim ownership over a page or section which he does not own 
 im not assessing either hmvN or pmandersons actions as that is the clerks domain neither am i interested in taking sides however in this situation you are clearly a third party intervening where you should not there is enough drama on the pages associated with this matter please let the clerks do their job without muddying the waters 
 locke_cole please note from 
 none of those bullet points applies to removal of comments it explicitly says prior to the very first bullet point that the following items are exceptions to editing another editors comments not removing them outright as you have done and even if it did say remove id still take issue with every point you have listed N we are not discussing an article we are discussing arbitration N 
 hi ckatz could i ask you to consider removing the made by my actions that are in question removed edits that didnt belong in my arbitratorrequested section i then politely pmanderson to move his edits to a more suitable locationuN which he did any actions i did are outside the scope of the 
 i dont feel comfortable removing the proposals given that it is an arbcom page however i have left a comment stating that i feel it should be removed hope this helps 
 i understand thanks for your input at the page though what a mess i cant wait to leave datedelinking issues behind so that i can get back to editing articles cheers 
 it seems like the geonotice for wikipedia takes boston that was added yesterday was broken http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlemediawikigeonoticejs and diffN and oldidN could you please readd it thank you 
 ack fixed now 
 thanks 
 as to my general assertions that a casual review found other cases where you may have erred in this regard i did find such i felt there was enough in what i found that another set of eyes should be alerted to have a look at the record further that the closing of the thread by a user needed to be undone if need be i can do the research to show you where this has possibly happened before but it is not necessary to demonstrate to you that it is important to stay well clear of violating this principle of wikipedia i have already done that with the links above i encourage you to seek outside input from another administrator in cases where it is not blatant vandalism 
 hammersoft i appreciate your taking the time to reply and i have reviewed the above cases one thing that became immediately clear is that this block is in no way whatsoever even remotely similar to the incidents you have referenced those cases involved editors who had been and remained directly involved in the articles in question they had participated in the pages they were content contributors and they used their bit to their advantage the wolfN ip issue here involves the reversal of the repeated deletion of properly referenced material by a singlepurpose ip editor i had no part in the original posting of that material i had not contributed content to the article and i had no prior involvement with the ip my only prior edits to the page involved a few minor style guide issues so to say i was an active editor on the page or that i frequented the page is completely incorrect there is no parallel here at all as supported by the comments at the an or i review wherein at least two other admins have stated that my actions were appropriate given the ips actions i could understand your point if i had actually contributed any content to the article or been a part of the creation process there but i was not again i appreciate your input but we will have to agree to disagree with regards to your assertions 
 the point here is that it wasnt vandalism multiple people in the thread agree it was a content dispute some disagree but theres plenty enough that agree that it is obviously not a black or white issue if it was vandalism pure and simple id be in perfect agreement with you but it wasnt im very disappointed with your answer here do you not see the problem inherent in this behavior im trying to keep this amicable i really am if you fail to understand how serious this is the behavior is going to be repeated id rather not see that happen and feel it would be necessary to follow 
 after a few metres of text have been written at ani on it and you still hadnt addressed the issue is there a protocol that i should talkpage or email you first you know that i think a lot of your writing skills and strategic talent i have said so and im not necessarily against you hereuN not at alluN but why dont you defend yourself on the only topic that matters i have to go to bed soon i look forward to hearing from you i certainly would like to collaborate with you if theres ever a topic or project im open to your suggestions 
 hey are you in to reformatting of the various legislative district articles although wed still leave blanks for political parties especially those preN st century those can have some improvements such as using one table or district instead of separate tables when an lgu is added or removed or changed also we can add results from the N election lets use the american congressional districts as a model and ndash 
 unfortunately i hate the way some lgu articles are appearing right now with election results not that im saying its irrelevant but it appears we are becoming so obsessed with tables rather than real articles themselves i find too much clutter if thats gonna take place 
 heh however vote results seem to be the norm for district articles unlike for lgu articles the old suggestion is still on the table and ndash 
 my position has not changed it will just be tons of article stubs which can be gathered in N single article i dont see the need 
 i was planning for them to be retained in their respective articles only the manner of presentation will be different and ndash 
 if you wont object id be changing the 
 also most of the city articles that dont need the word city in their titles were moved its a good idea to start moving their corresponding district articles to the new names too such as 
 you may also want to edit this article 
 the section N th senator is an analysis 
 is sourced and wed need other special elections specially on the house section and ndash 
 appears editorial like to me not encyclopedic 
 its simplified now and ndash 
 looking at the abra legislative district its really harder to understand it though i know a lot of lists have migrated to that format i find it fine though on the local front it will create a lot of room to monitor the changes in political affiliation which cannot be guaranteed all the time rendering the article outdated i just dont think there is a need to include a remarks column a footnote will do this is the same with the N th congress where the senators would have to be labelled whether they are part of the majority and minority which cannot be paralled in the house simply because they vote for their chambers presiding officer 
 rumoured is not a misspelling it is an english variant of the americanised rumored would be the correct coding for it if it were an actual misspelling on wikipedia when we quote things we use sic for mistakes that appear in the original text there is no mistake in that text excepting the speculation which i shall now remove if you would like me to explain anything further please do not hesitate to contact me friend 
 of course i dig that i didnt want anyone to think it was an error though which is almost circular logic bah never mind i do apologise if what i wrote seemed a little aggressive score for wikipedia though in the removal of speculation hooray 
 the reason that i ask is because i heard that you removed the category N s american television series and i wanted to know why you did so 
 no problem the rationale is that we generally avoid crystalball type categories and tags the series may be scheduled to go into the N s and it probably will do that but until it actually happens for the same reason we dont update episode counts until a new episode actually airs and we list series as present rather than a future scheduled end date hope this helps 
 hi ckatz i noticed your major edit there just one thing user access to google docs is currently supported through mozilla firefox N and newer versions microsoft internet explorer N and N safari N and N beta google chrome N and opera is it necessary to specify the platform for each of these browsers i guess safari version N is for the mac btw i think its no longer a beta version 
 anyhow not sure it was a major edit as i was really just trimming and rearranging to pass the time after reverting the spam link however since you brought it up the express details probably arent needed there either the article was or still is a bit heavy on minute details that are probably better left to either a comparison table or the softwares faq pages (any thoughts on 
 i watchlisted google docs because its transforming my work with international clients i cant wait for google wave which i hope will be less clunky more frequent to refresh and more flexible in formatting have you seen the demos on youtube 
 thanks for taking care of the fake suckpuppetry against alonso or dxfanadan and me btw complete exoneration in spanish is exoneracixfN n completa cheers 
 that was 
 what do you think about the discussion at 
 i have been monitoring commons and it appears the file attribution has now been adjusted to allay his or her concerns that would seem to address the issue 
 this writer suggests that under the fairtax rates could go as high as N per cent 
 thanks morphh i will have to study it some more 
 why did you add a copyvio tag to intoxicating substances act N i didnt see anything on there that would constitute a violation 
 ok i didnt realize thatsorry i am not the one who originally wrote that page anyway i was just trying to clean it up anyway as far as i know statutes in most countries are public domain so even if the page is copryrighted the statute itself is not 
 to be honest with you i really dont know whether this is the official published version of the statute or merely a summary thereof this is a uk statute and i only know a little bit about british law i would have to do some research on the matter to answer that question for you if i find anything out i will get back to you i apologize for any confusion this may have caused 
 any revised wording would still have to reflect the one line concept as that is how the line will be described by the public translink is going to be describing runs as canada line to richmondbrighouse and canada line to yvrairport as this would mirror what they do with the other lines i have reworked the lead to reflect the main or branch or length issues 
 if line means track than we could say that two types of service operate on the canada line however in that case we would run into such terms as express service or fullstop service along a single line if service were introduced from surrey city center to lougheed mall what would this be called millennium line to lougheed mall maybe and millenium line to king george in this case it would be more elegant to simply give the line a new name to reflect its unique route whether we have the imagination to go beyond surreycoquitlam line or simply give up on naming lines and just give destinations only such as coquitlam via new westminster or surrey city via new westminster the former would then change to vancouver via lougheed mall after passing new westminster we could also resort to numbers such as N etc like the bus in bus terminology this would be a route but i dont think this term is used for railways or metro i will do some more research and it may be possible to enhance the line entry in wikipedia cheers 
 i would like to comment to this as this has been been going off like crazy in my watchlist as far as im concerned ckatz is right there is only one line with it splitting up at bridgeport there is no spur line the trains alternate between yvr and brighouse a service does not need a unique name although i would have liked it to be named canada line and airport line the expo line is eventually have a service running from metrotown to waterfront it will not receive a new name even if there was a service from surrey central to lougheed centre i dont see why it should have another name because it does not have its exclusive branch 
 ckatz N +N N do we need multiple consensus over that fact srebrenica genocide was a fact why do we need consesus over that can you please elaborate thank you 
 i was just about to send you a note here but you replied on the noticeboard first could you please refer me to the tv guideline section where it says deceased characters belong in the main cast list in both the info box and the following show summary i only ask because i only see you doing this with 
 again if you could direct me to where it says this and directs us not to remove former characters i would be able to understand it better i am certainly trying to follow all of the wiki rules but i have seen much conflicting info on this none of it official that is why i am asking for the wiki guidelines on this thank you ckatz trista 
 hello ckatz trista here i am at home and logged in on with the user name i plan to be using whenever possible to make my edits on my ip page you had mentioned my comment about you counselling people as if you were an admin i wanted you to know that it was not apparent to me at that time you indeed were an admin as i rushed through your archive and i certainly meant no insult by it i hope you understand there are a lot of people on wiki who are not admins who give good advice and i just thought you might be one of those so please accept my apology as i realise now how insulting it sounded at the time okay again if you can find the part in the television project about listing former characters i really want to read it so i will be a good editor please understand my confusion as i dont see this on every csi page or every tv showso it did appear it was a preference when you replaced vanessa so many times i am more than willing to learn from you as other than this incident your edits are always right on in my opinion and i have never had a problem finding the wiki reference behind them cheers trista 
 hello the article for 
 sorry about that i have move this to 
 why did you revert the arc sections on the sga page 
 the previous version was structured better if you wish to mention the arcs i would suggest integrating them into the existing seasonbyseason format and trimming that down 
 it is structured the same way as the 
 thanks for bringing this up i dont see any deletion tag on these images neither on the english wiki nor on common not sure whats going on 
 i think i understand what happened now and the bot was actually doing its job you received the notice of speedy deletion on these images because you edited those images page by adding the dinosaur approved image tag on them that automatically create a file in the english wiki with the same name than the image on commons this seems to be against some wiki policies and the file were speedily deleted that of course arises a concern for us because it appears that we could in principle not tag commons images with our approved tag not sure how to go around this cheers 
 actually the bot only delivered the message of speedy deletion to you but the images themselves were tagged for deletion by an user the problem is that some images like mine are only in commons others are only on the english wiki and still others are on both one solution would be to upload images that are in commons on the english wiki to be tagged approved 
 hey there although i like the general layout of the phil collins template and think it could work for his singles albums and eventual tours i think the first part with all the names is a bit excessive it gives the appearance that all those people were vital parts of collins career so including 
 hey again just thinking you could probably replace the first part with some of the other collins links in wikipedia such as 
 per the email that the user sent me and my quick discussion with luna i have unblocked the account i will keep a close eye on the user to make sure hes on the right path should things go awry we can always reblock cheers 
 hello thanks for the note unfortunately i didnt have the time to finish earlier and i suspect you may not prefer the rewrite that i have since done the reality is that we are obligated to include what is said about the film even if it is negative as this is an encyclopedia article i understand that it may be difficult for the cast and crew but that is what what is required by wikipedias policies of neutrality please feel free to ask if you have any questions about this 
 abel the concerns i expressed about your edits are based on your previous posts where you have indicated a desire to avoid the negative press as for the article we cannot ignore what has been said about the film if it were only one bad review in a sea of praise perhaps but look at the comments from the major press that we didnt useabout as cruddy as a cruddy little indie can get especially given a cast that should have known better glatzer aims to wring laughter out of this desperation but succeeds only in producing a series of contrived characters and situations that make the breakfast club look like an unfiltered documentary an unusually subdued coogan does his best but this is the kind of pretentious nonsense he usually satirizes mr coogan doesnt seem altogether comfortable with his part which like the story undergoes a number of unconvincing changes without a trace of tempo or one shred of narrative pacing what goes up is not really a movie its the cheapest kind of amateurishness that looks like it was shot with a cell phone obviously we are not here to trash a film but we also cannot selectively pickandchoose reviews that only cast it in a positive light as such i strongly encourage you to discuss future changes on the articles talk page instead of simply reverting otherwise we run the risk of this devolving into an edit war if you remain unconvinced as to the role wikipedia plays in covering material we can certainly seek additional input regarding the article 
 hey there i think its very much improved now i just thought the prior box was a bit excessive but im glad a phil collins template is now there as i have toyed with the idea of creating one in the past i agree that phil collins big band should be added to the list of bands so i put it in i also added a complete discography link at the end of the studio albums to link to 
 thanx oh yeahcongrats on the phil collins article getting the fa status plus can you help me out with this article i kinda rushed it a bit and i feel like i have completely fked the thing up 
 thanks for the kind words it was my first real attempt at a main article so i was happy to see the article approved with little difficulty i fixed up the 
 i notice you have had problems with this user in the past just wanted to give you notice i have started a thread at 
 dont take it personally many hundreds of people are repeatedly trying to add links to wikipedia and it is necessary that they be resisted your edit summary did not establish why the link was desirable and the site does not strike the casual observer as suiting 
 i notice you have recently made a large number of edits to the futurama episode pages mostly adding wiki links while i appreciate the help with the episode pages i wonder if it is necessary to link every word in the article that happens to have a wiki page for example words like puppy or cigar likely dont require a link for most readers also i notice that most wikipedia pages do not add links for every use of the word for example if the word 
 i wouldnt add them back if thats what your asking also i added them because of other wiki users who may be interested in some of the things metionedbut yeah i think i did go a bit overboard with the wikilinks 
 sorry the afd has been open for barely two days and all interested parties should get a chance to comment it goes beyond affecting this one article and gives editors a chance to see how the community feels policy applies to these types of articles see for example 
 i closed it because there was a stong consensus to keep the article im not sure but you reverting it could be considered a conflict of interest but im just assuming something there N votes of support in a row is pretty strong for me to believe that any naysayers will likely be drowned out by more supports looking back i actually should have closed it as a speedy keep 
 i really wish you hadnt closed it again now it can be referred to as a flawed afd result as it wasnt run for N days and the close did not explain how the policy arguments on both sides were weighed when making the decision to keep 
 a nonadmin is usually allowed to close an afd if they are in good standing and the there is an obvious consensus to keep it i dont believe that i should have cited policies as most closures never say which policies were involved if there was more of a close call on its closure i would likely review things further and cite policies i have closed plenty of these debates without problem so i really dont think that there was anything special that had to be done with this one as this one had more support votes than my minimum requirements for an early closure 
 i have amended my closure rationale but i dont agree that this is tainted 
 thank you for doing that 
 two notes about closing afds please make sure you use the template at the end of the piece or else the archive box will run all the way to the end of the daily log it took me a while to figure out what wasnt quite right about 
 ooh forgot about that there sorry for the mishap as i am usually great at remembering those things 
 no worries 
 thats a big welcome back from me and unfortunately from unid please look 
 thanks for the note i have cleaned up the page per your request cheers 
 regarding the results table i have got the same concern for 
 last five years and a seperate main article for results sounds like a good plan question is does that work for brabham which died in N 
 N so its the same problem as for williams from a historical perspective theres no particular relevance to 
 please see 
 blocked edits removed and i have asked for the urls to be added to the blacklist at meta cheers 
 the place to discuss content disputes is on the talk page of the article you may even find earlier discussions regarding the points that concern you 
 could you take a look at the image removals going on with 
 i also just noticed yworo reported 
 regarding that you reverted i noticed that the changes made were not at all consistent with the edit summary one particlarly stood out it was a change from 
 i was wondering if it was a straight revert given the wide range of changes good work on tracking down the older version given what you have said is there any point in me sifting through the changes or should i just leave it for the page regulars 
 i have already looked through it and could only find two changes of value which i have already fixed the vast majority of the changes in the edit reinroduced errors that had been corrected in the subsequent N edits 
 i have replied on your talk page but in a nutshell you have to stop adding the link as the site owner you are in a conflict of interest and as an editor here you are not following the consensus process two separate editors have disagreed with your link yet you continue to restore it which is a real problem you are far better off offering your knowledge on the talk page where it can be properly assessed 
 someone raised the issue of 
 actually forget it its been remedied laters and nbsp 
 hi skully good to be back and i will have a look at the prost article but im still going to be limited in the amount of time i can spend on this for a while so it will be slow nice work on 
 looks pretty good i have put it up as octobers selected article on the portal i will try and have a look at it with an eye to any further tidying later cheers 
 we wish you well but wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a place to promote causes however worthwhile there are lots of people who would like to add thousands of 
 im not sure i understand your objection it looks like you took the intuitive and found better sources 
 no problem im expecting a little resistance but its dirty work thats gotta be done these messages are better then the alternative a complete purge of all youtube links 
 help me out on whats wrong ckatz i didnt need discussion on the 
 can you tell me were these problems are writing style organization and other aspects that warrant the revert so i can fix them 
 seriously im been looking over my article of the xfiles what the crap is wrong 
 as mentioned there are issues with the writing style the organization and other aspects the lead paragraph was much stronger in its previous incarnation whereas the revised one appears somewhat unfocused i have just come online for today and will be able to actually sit down and give an indepth readthrough later on 
 just tell me what you mean with writing style bad grammar lousy writte etc is m one unfocus or the one standing their now lets talk more about this when you have time okay 
 so when is this socalled review gonna happen 
 you are good at reverting but not given reasons for why you revert if you dont give information which can improve my text i can very well just add it again since my one does breach some guidelines the old one didnt 
 with all due respect i have briefly expressed my concerns as well it does take a certain period of uninterrupted time to review and note the full extent of the issues apologies if it is not fast enough but i have a lot on my plate right now however i will say that while your efforts are certainly appreciated i do feel that the rewrite has sufficient issues with it that we are better off keeping the original in place and adapting parts of the rewrite rather than the other way around i wont be able to give it a solid read for a few days yet but if that doesnt work for you than i can assist in calling for a third opinion 
 the truth is if would or had given a list of what needed fixing i would gladly fix it 
 the pages were compared and the immediate impression was that the old one was better off as the current version to be used as a base the revised lead was very problematic and some of the reordering also appeared to be that way there were also quite a few references that were removed as dead links whereas the usual practise is to tag them as dead links while retaining the information 
 i will probably ask the users at the televison wikiproject 
 rt and metacritic have established notability as aggregate review sites and as such are considered to add value to article content from that perspective simply put wikipedia benefits more from the use than the site does the case is reversed for individual sites that have not established notability independently as they receive far more of a boost from being mentioned here than wikipedias articles do by including their content while i can understand your concern at having your site rejected in favour of a competitors you have to remember that we are not looking at it from the same perspective 
 thats a fair contribution to two fas now well done 
 just to second that congratulations of getting prost to fa hes probably one of the three most important drivers in modern fN history great work 
 would you like to help improve wikipedias coverage of topics related to the national archives and its incredible collection this summer the national archivesuN which houses some of americas most important historical documentsuN is hosting me as its wikipedian in residence and i have created 
 it doesnt seem like there is anything here worth merging which isnt in other articles already in which articles what is your knowledge of the soviet system 
 hi you removed a link to the world futures studies federation giving the edit summary rm el which i dont know what that means but the organisation is a consultant to the united nations ~ 
 mail is only for really confidential communication if you have a problem with a specific article you should comment on the talk page of that article or as you have done you could ask here if wondering about what a specific editor has done please read 
 hi skully thanks for joining us reviewing has been in a lull recently as much of our energy has been focussed on finishing things for 
 hello again our 
 please put your ideas on 
 i removed most of the boldface lettering from the article and what do you mean by the referencing is insuficcient 
 how do i list the references in different areas but make it so that it doesnt show up as there being N references when there are only N 
 but i went through and put the new ref group syntax in 
 hey i havent done an explanatory footnote in ages i just gave yall the idea and now you do them too lol that said splitting them out works really well so thanks for that 
 noticed you removed it as a source from 
 sorry for the delay in responding as i have been offline for a few weeks (i have also replied to this matter at 
 hi skully i have been keeping an eye on your edits over the past few weeks and i think you should be a admin is it alright if i nominated you to be an admin 
 i have gone along and nominated you but before you are listed you need to accept the nomination and answer three questions at 
 please do not vandalize pages as you did with this edit to kosovo war if you continue to do so you will be blocked from editing katiehN N N august N 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or for getting three fN articles to fa and for much hard work around the place 
 i will admit to helping with them but most importantly you provided the drive to actually push them through each stage of the process 
 hi again please see my request above of august N many thanks 
 sorry didnt see that note i will take a look at the page cheers and thanks for following up on this 
 full quote from me which i stand by in its entirety i get it that you dont agree please dont belabor it further col warden has an extreme ideology that appears to view deleting articles as something akin to murder bye 
 probably moot at this point but balis right and wscs off the mark giving him a hard time imho ++ 
 whew i was hoping i wasnt bothering you as you seem busy btw if you have any suggestion as to how to address the N odd edits that were made that are referenced in the discussion that would be great as well 
 thanks might you have any suggestion as to how to address the N odd edits that were made referenced in that discussion the editor has been asked to revert but has not done so tx 
 if theres consensus regarding the format it shouldnt be a problem if people wish to restore the previous version 
 btw nikola how do you feel about the adminship now 
 now i feel very fine about adminship thanks for asking i wont let you down this time 
 redone 
 or your 
 thanks for nominating this image which i originally uploaded to wikicommons hopefully we can find some more good fN images to add to the two featured ones 
 yes thats a good ides as the 
 i will go and start a discussion 
 i have undeleted the page as you were right it shouldnt have been deleted as the rfd was only for non notable asteroids thanks for spotting it 
 now that is great service thanks for addressing this so quickly cheers 
 dont waste your breath responding to him i dont see a collaborative future with him uN 
 sigh 
 any thoughts on my revisions of the critics reviews so far im trying to make them fuller rather than soundbites that could be splattered across some commercial for the film also i have to agree with inurhead about undue weight i think it would be most appropriate to keep it to only varietys derek elley for a negative viewpoint what do you think uN 
 straw arguments dont make you guys seem unbiased try another tactic go ahead and delete everything blank the whole page for all i care you are only destroying wikipedia and invalidating the integrity of your own contributions to other pages 
 those links have been there for some time and you are removing them claiming to do so according to wpel your repeated claim that their inclusion needs to be justified simply does not fly in that context but applies only to disputing them when they are put up in the first place i have told you that i see nothing on wpel to justify your deletion and therefore have restored them i submit that the fact that i agreed with the removal of the link to the prisoner appreciation society not only shows objectivity on my part but proves that i have examined both the wpel page and the external sites i hereby demand that you quote something specific from the page which you have claimed supports your deletions that actually does so or drop the issue 
 you are incorrect in presuming that there for some time equates to a right to be there the links fail the what not to include section and are not necessary given the presence of professional sources 
 i made no such equation what i did was point out that once something has been in place for a significant amount of time one who wishes to remove it must justify the removal if it is justified this would be done quite easily and i find your extreme resistance to making any such attempt quite telling blankly asserting the links fail does not establish as fact that they do in any way shape or form whatsoever i repeat i have examined both the regulatory page you cite and the sites in question and find nothing in the former that justifies deleting the latter if you are unable to quote something from the page which disqualifies any or all of those sites from inclusion you have no grounds or right to remove them i again demand that you produce such a quote 
 under 
 as masem point out above fansites need to be written by a recognized authority meaning as a minimum sufficient notability for biographies until six of one has its own wp entry its not notable so im removing the link to the fansite page which provides no information that isnt available in betterreferenced form elsewhere 
 suggest this discussion could be more appropriately conducted on the 
 agreed 
 it looks like something from a fairytale but its probably not clear enough right 
 you seem to be not aware there is a group of people who remove informations about drawbacks of soviet system some of them were involved in this removal they call me antirussian is 
 hi phill i noticed your recent edits to 
 in the meantime i have restored the constructor links in 
 hi there i know its a notable milestone however i dont think that it belongs in notes i think that the notes section under classification should be restricted to information direct to the race classification not trivial facts 
 i understand what you are saying about the users and the ease of use but when its there to me it seems completely out of context i mean drivers get their first points all the time why would the reader need to know this in the results section if they are looking in results they are after the results not extra information i always see the notes section as a place to put in information that either helps the reader interpret the results or important information relating directly to what happened in the race the very reason the note section is there inside the classification section is for the extra race facts not trivial ones also the 
 making this about particular references is clearly a red herring i was objecting to the masses of leading to a very very strong 
 i have gone through your points at 
 redone 
 how is 
 the fact that mgm is broadcasting repeats of its own production is not notable in fact one would expect them to do so keep in mind that the series is in syndication on many networks and wikipedia is not a television guide 
 dear dave souza thank you for reminding me that my views on the peppered moth were purely personal i would like you to know that when i tried to check out the note noN on the internet it said no such page any longer existed best wishes janeyjo 
 thanks for the headsup i will have a look 
 it is indeed thank you for that information good to hear from you from brief description it sounds far too deep for me and i didnt even manage to read all of verbose analysis am not much of a novel reader but did have a look at the 
 also i am very sorry about our differences earlier in the year and i apologise if the comment i made about you personally insulted you 
 if you can find the thing out of the autosport magazine about the white tyre markings that will be great thanks 
 added it to article as seen in thanks if there are any additional problems leave a message on the fac page 
 N your knowledgeable answers at the reference desk i guess a lot of the volunteers there just answer whether they know or not or else pretend the question was slightly different than it actually was a question they do know the answer to
 you are welcome what also goes wrong on the ref desk imo is that there are too many people answering questions and also that these people are the same regulars that then tends to generate long discussions among the regulars 
 hi there just thought you should know that blanked his block notice like hes blanked every warning against him for edit warring previous 
 thanks for the note he seems to have left the most recent one in place cheers 
 an rfc has been made in regard to this dispute and mdash 
 in short the post is being reverted because it does not meet wikipedias manual of style and introduces excessive detail and trivia into the article i will try to add some links for you to read later this evening cheers 
 the link is simply unfit for inclusion your assessment that it abides by all guidelines is erroneous please feel free to familiarize yourself with our 
 morphh this is something that has been nagging me the past few weeks it seems to me to be an example of one of the things that wont come down much property tax will disappear and thats about it any thoughts is this something about the fairtax that should be tweaked 
 thanks morphh knowing you are pretty busy i posted the question here as well yahoos ask answer if you have a yahoo account you might post a reply there are a couple of replies from people who obviously dont know what the fairtax is about on the other hand dont worry too much about it unless you have signed up anonymously i will say something when i have time 
 i appreciate it morphh btw i saw a response elsewhere that sounded a lot like what you might have said which was not bad for the limited space allowed i do think the fairtax could do a lot for the country and i do think it is irresponsible for people running for the presidency not to familiarize themselves with it 
 yes i agree i wasnt clear when i talked about things being cheaper i was typing on the fly with no editing a dangerous thing for me to do i am heartened to see any move by anyone to look into the fairtax if even one of them speaks well of it afterwords it could make a difference and if any democrats got on board that would be great i saw a newer version of the fairtax book with the new afterwords but i havent seen the fairtax book ii i will be looking forward to it i probably am singlehandedly responsible for hastings profits on books 
 hi ckatz iuN m curious why you reverted by N his or her edits were factually correct and there was no explanation for the revert thanks uN 
 this doesnuN t matter anymore thanks uN 
 i got the wrong edit with twinkle 
 hey thanks for the note no problem at all i have done that before as well cheers 
 could you explain your reversion of my edit to 
 ah sorry thought id commented on that the planet articles dont use astrological symbols in that manner so they were reverted from the lead sentence sorry for the inconvenience 
 again we are not a directory service many quality sites do not have links specifically because we try to avoid giving preferential treatment keep in mind that this is not a knock against your particular site but instead a reflection of the established consensus with regards to links which we try to keep to a minimum furthermore there are several issues that complicate this most notably that you have repeatedly arestored the links without seeking consensus to do so and that you are adding the links despite having a direct conflict of interest in doing so given your relationship with the site you cannot add links to it and would have to convince other editors of the sites merits in order to see if they feel it warrants inclusion 
 it was not me that ip vandalized several of my pages thank you for the help their entire contribution history is all attacks at me i dont know what i did but it isnt me thanks for the help 
 the text benefits the companies you have listed but not the article i think youd be hardpressed to argue that pickled productions is anywhere near comparable to apple fox and chase bank 
 hi as someone who has contributed to an fN article that has achieved fa status i would be grateful for your comments on the max mosley article which i have nominated for fa i know you havenuN t contributed to it before which is why i think you would have a impartial view point at the moment no one from the fN portal has commented many thanks 
 hi thank you for your time i know its a long read glad you thought it was suitable for fa have a good easter 
 the show debuts this friday so its not in production and we have a source that says it will debut on october N N and we have a source that says there will be N episodes so that info should also be in the infobox i dont see why it should not be in infobox also it should not have in production in or first_aired as that is for the shows debut date it should be in or status see 
 also 
 this comes up every so often sourced or not the convention is that we only update season and episode counts in the infobox after an episode airs 
 again 
 no we would put N the following week N and so on look i understand your confusion as the doc isnt too clear but the established convention as used on all series articles is that we update only based on aired episodes that is why changes prior to air are reverted immediately as there are too many variables that can affect a scheduled airdate will it air at that day and time realistically of courcse however we have no way of knowing if an unexpected event will occur and disrupt scheduling so we wait 
 i am not going to edit war and i am not being disruptive as i am reverting your edits per 
 listen i dont know how many times i have to say this what you are proposing is contrary to the established practice for the infobox if you are not convinced by my explanations please refer to the recent discussions at the television project where this came up a few days back with regards to the cleveland show as with your case there were references indicating a planned run of x episodes however despite that the convention is to only list aired episodes in the infobox with the other details going in the body copy just N other points raised include the fact that while N episodes may be planned for they are not all actually produced as of yet if the series is cancelled during its run several of these episodes may never even be scripted or shot 
 let me know if that sounds weird 
 i noticed your question on N uN es talk page you need to add ly at the end 
 no trouble conversely im a lot more comfortable with french than italian its only a very rough rule of thumb but you will often find that where in italian you pronounce all of the letters in a word in french you often dont pronounce the last letter theres tonnes of exceptions though 
 hi thanks for the edits which have improved the page however i am confused as to why you think that some of the external links were irrelevant the muckers are fans of the football team blackpool fc and therefore links to blackpool fc are surely totally relevant the other link which was to another football club fair enough but links to the team that the muckers are fans of should be there do you not think thanks tangerines N N february N 
 replied 
 the links just seemed out of place since the article isnt specifically about the football club as for tidying it up not a problem i will run the article through 
 best wishes 
 hey thanks for the question unfortunately in this case it is a site that appears to have been spammed across just about any article the sites people could get away with there were over N links to the site when i first noticed it many of which were spammed by an ip in N and a singlepurpose editor in the past few days many of the links were added as references to basic information that should come from more reliable sources while other links were used to replace existing links from government sources hope this helps 
 i have reverted your additions to 
 in response to your question the source that you cited seems good the text added to the article just needs to be paraphrased the best suggestion i have to do this is to read the source set it aside and try to recreate what it says in your own words paraphrasing will also help to keep the content concise and to the point the thing is that you cant use any of the existing sentence structure unless you put it in quotes even if you got permission to use the content it may not flow well with the rest of the article also if you got permission they might require that it is posted unedited which is impossible to maintain here mufka 
 give reasons for spammed link 
 hello please do not restore the link to the procon site links to this site have been added en masse by singlepurpose accounts and ips such as 
 please give reasons why especially this link cant be used 
 and even it its difficult for you try to be polite even in your edit summaries 
 i fail to see how this exchange is impolite if anything your replies to date have been far more provocative than mine i have removed these links as an administrative action one that was begun after noting the suspicious pattern in which they were for the most part added there is no reason for you to issue warnings and make spurious claims regarding politeness as you have done furthermore keep in mind that the spammed site was tagged onto the line prostitution in germany is legal along with brothel ownership there is no reason why this text cannot be referenced from an official government source 
 the N th and last time please give reasons why especially this link cant be used some linkspam is no reason for this link you didnt reply to any of my answers and questions 
 you are apparently ignoring the explanations i have already provided the indication that there has been a concerted effort to spam this site the fact that the information in question can easily be sourced from what would be a more appropriate source anyway and the assessment by a second admin that site is not suitable as a reference 
 think youd be able to find out the top scorers for the four earlyN s seasons that are currently blank in the above article 
 sure i can probably work out ellis total from by clicking on each league result for that season but i will do that another time 
 i changed the category title to from blackpool so you will need to change it in your user page accordingly 
 yeah i tried to keep it orange but the background of the arms is white so it looked pants i will try and get the orange back in there 
 cordially cat yronwode 
 i have commented on the talk page but i will add here that the job quote cannot be used to speculate about his job security just as we cannot use the creepy comment nor can we speculate about cbs and their policies or lettermans status with regards to those policies simply put a lot of details with regards to this matter may well be better suited to wikinews as we have to look at the bigger picture to determine what is news and what is encyclopedic 
 the job quote was not used to speculate about anything he said it i am reinserting it youd better have a better reason to cut his full paragraph right before the last sentence than that we are speculating given your adamant removal policy of such important material i am now going to return this matter to the topics own talk page discussing it with you here is going nowhere cat 
 catherine the use as you added it implies there is an issue with his job status there is no evidence to suggest that and we are not here to speculate imply or any other such task if you are adamant about the line get consensus on the talk page but you need to do that before restoring it 
 thanks 
 morphh i was wondering if there was already a rebuttal to this flat tax so i wouldnt have to redo the wheel 
 never mind i went ahead and took a stab at it 
 i didnt want you to do any writing i just thought there might be some areadymade counterdebates lying around someplace i think if i do it myself i will learn it better though but i have thought a possible point having to do with cost of living in various parts of the country cost of living will vary it costs more in new york or california than oklahoma or wyoming suppose we have average state cost of living figures instead of one national figure i suppose some will then go on to suggest cost of living figures for paducah texas vs houston texas but wed have to draw the line somewhere 
 hi ckatz i noticed that you removed the website proconorg as a source from the article 
 i agree with your assessment this site is a tertiary source with unknown quality control and usually no named author 
 well it isnt always so bad i restored it where it was more or less accurate on one point in 
 problem is the site has a demonstrated history of being spammed over a period stretching back at least a year in such cases it is desirable to avoid using the site at all from what i have seen the text it has been used to reference can all be replaced with more appropriate more direct and nonspammed sites 
 i understand the specifics above but got here from a similar edit and tend to agree with john there are many instances where procon is a melding ref for both povs in the general arena where pro and con are so evident and exclusionary this site tends to place them as part of the whole and says so i also somewhat question the passive usage of being spammed what does that mean that some are citing it more regularly on wikipedia is that a valid reason to delete a ref and replace it with a facttag it might be seen as lessthanadequate agf 
 i see procon as a wikipedialike source it is someones compilation of things that are interesting to them the reason we shouldnt cite it much is the same as the reason we arent supposed to cite other wikipedia articles most of what i can see there is reasonable quality and well intentioned but in almost all cases we can ourselves cite the sources that procon cites 
 again by being spammed i mean that there are several ip and spa accounts whose edits consist solely of adding links to the procon site on a host of articles when i first discovered the links there were well over N of them many were in the external links sections added one after another by the same account others were tossed into articles on text tha tcould easily be sourced more directly or even used to replace more direct sources are some added by wellintentioned editors in all likelihood yes however based on what i have seen these are a tiny minority of the total number of links compared to the huge list of spammed links assuming good faith is important of course but when an accounts entire history involves nothing other than adding procon links and when those same format links appear throughout other articles agf has its limits in the face of a definite effort to spam the links 
 with respect to the ips its not a question of more than i would like it is instead the fact that several ips and accounts came to wikipedia for no other purpose than to add dozens and dozens of links to the procon site furthermore many of those links were added as external links in a manner contrary to what is permitted under the external links guideline or used to replace existing references that in some cases were to more direct sources it is a simple reality that any time you have a site that is being spammed by singlepurpose accounts or an editor whose primary role on wikipedia involves promoting or using one particular source you have to take a very close look at the site in this case the site itself is questionable as a reference source any material they post without explanations of where they sourced it cant be verified by us and any information they post from referenced sources should really be sourced here to that primary source 
 hello fyi i have restored the request for a check on the ip let me be perfectly clear i mean no disrespect at all to your position as a clerk at the cu page ordinarily i would support your assertion that this might be perceived as fishing and as such would not even have made the request to begin with however as the admin who has had to oversee a large portion of the ehc matter i can speak with authority in stating that this individual who has been banned from the community has a clearly defined pattern of block evasion facilitated by use of multiple ip and registered sock accounts as such i have restored the posting with the request that this application be judged by a checkuser given that it involves a long long history of abusive behaviour a simple review of this individuals contribution history his sock account lists and related incidents will demonstrate how these socks have been used in attempts to control article content disrupt formal wikipedia procedures and actively target wikipedia users through extremely abusive behaviour on and offsite while the ip block at N may prevent him from using accounts from that location he has a history of linking in form other ports with these sock accounts 
 sure no harm done reading the title of this i thought you wanted me to perform a check for a moment i actually saw this on the irc channel when you reverted it 
 regarding 
 my contributions to the article have been mostly cosmetic or largely focused on the notable people section i havent lived in england for four years and im not all that knowledgeable about the inner workings of the town itself i just keep an eye on the article for vandalism purposes i think you are better suited to make any changes than i am 
 theres no limit to the number of images you can add to an article you can always add a gallery section to an article (see 
 just wondering if the newspaper is still called the blackpool evening gazette and not the blackpool gazette 
 thanks 
 the problem lies in the fact that the material is unreferenced you may say that it is true and it may well be true but wikipedia requires sources that can be verified by readers if you can provide proof from 
 actually you are the one who needs to stop your repeated efforts to add wurelated material to articles where it does not belong the class of vehicle is relevant but the make is completely irrelevant to the story as evidenced by the news article you have linked to note that your terminology strongly suggests a pov on your part one that cannot form a part of an article 
 per since you are apparently the protecting admin i will state this explicitly to you first please unprotect 
 incidentally i could add another N or N articles about the incident which have since been published its ignorant to challenge the matters worthiness to be included 
 you are more than welcome to open discussion regarding the matter on the articles talk page however i would point out that you are making several presumptions in your statements that are not grounded in fact first and foremost please do not presume that anyone who does not embrace your perspective on the matter is trying to cover something up or that they hold an opposing view with regards to wu simply put an article was being repeatedly changed by ips whose edits served only to further one and the same purpose that is to add material only tangentially related to the subject of the article secondly note that noone is challenging the matters worthiness to be included in the wu article where it belongs however the focus of the controversy is not that wu specifically drives a yukon but that he drives a suv when making statements about environmental issues the make of the suv does not matter for that matter the fact he drives an suv is irrelevant to the article about suvs and as such we dont add details on wu to that article either beyond that you were repeatedly adding the material despite being advised it was not appropriate to this article a pattern that was proving disruptive to the article hence semiprotection if you can achieve consensus to add the material here it can certainly return but keep in mind that you would have to convince others that this abstract reference to a yukon is more relevant than any other cultural reference to it 
 i dont mind you reverting me at all providing that what you say is right but i am pretty much into ultra cultur myself and i have absolutely no idea who that guy is or have i ever seen his image on football matches i will check it out right now cheers 
 i think we should put it back but in a different way so it is not a mere list of websites which is why is was deleted in the first place and we should filter it out so the list will contain solely the groups that deserve to be in it cheers 
 oops sorry i have only just noticed your question to me i think you posted to my talk page at the same time as someone else and i only saw the other persons looks like you worked it out for yourself though 
 actually i was away for the weekend and didnt realise there was more than one new comment on my talk page upon clicking the link 
 another lie i have not been repeatedly adding the material i added it the first time and restored it once your accusations would be more persuasive if they werent based on lies 
 if you have concerns discuss them on the articles talk page so that all editors can participate as for your actions i must say that your decision to go through my recent contributions and look for problems with them is an interesting course of action it may not however help you in your desire to appear innocent in all of this 
 did you see this sample that you describe as fiendishly complicated i will open the page for comments by the end of the day today i am still editing it but try to read it before you say it is complicated 
 sorry didnt realise the page wasnt open for comments yet i will add something explaining my reasons anyway 
 i will take your comments into account as i edit i am going to remove your comments made before i opened discussion you can restate them after i edit if you wish 
 ok good luck with the proposal 
 please revisit proposal N at 
 let me know what you think 
 i have restored some of the links that you removed confirming theatre listings and officially published theatre reviews for which there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the source and no other source available 
 did he get back to you if so is there a way i can see his comments or that they can be made available to the public 
 btw i just wanted to add that contacting him was an impressive step for a wp editor to make it shows serious commitment to the article and the encyclopedia 
 this is an integral part of the character revealing his name to jd and therefore is not speculation or guessing the current information about janitor revealing his name to jd shouldnt even be in the article as it is misleading information it makes people think the characters name is in fact glenn matthews unless you have actually seen the final episode which until the dvd comes out not everybody has dlakeN N N october N 
 hello thanks for the note you raise some valid points and personally i dont really care either way however the important consideration here is that per 
 i think you can move it back now 
 i was just browsing and found this recently added article 
 in my eyes 
 i have tagged it accordingly 
 as the admin that insists on a full discussion on the future of the 
 fyi its not an article its a redirect page that you have proposed for conversion to a disambiguation page so far the serious arguments seem to lean toward keeping the redirect the N ip is just a disgruntled ip that is hounding my edits and another editor has already commented that the entries you have proposed arent especially necessary myself i dont care either way what the page is as long as proper procedure is followed that is why im acting in an administrative role there rather than as an editor with a particular preference 
 i assumed 
 sure ckatz we are all lawyers picking at the exact name of a wikipedia entry well if we are lawyers then forgive us for looking at the evidence no ckatz claims are unsupported by the evidence she is the only editor who advocates reverting to a redirect ckatz has insisted on doing so following at least five editors who have moved to reinstate or improve the disambiguation page no one but ckatz has advocated a redirect 
 most if not all the editors are newer editors with not that many contributions i personally agree with the redirect design no ones going to look up dog sex to find a professor
 wikipedia is not a meritocracy the number of edits a user has should not trump the points they bring further you point to the fact that no one would use 
 i didnt mean that way i meant that users that have been here longer and edit regularly tend to know policy also may they search dog sex postion but feel free to criticize me all you want
 also i wasnt refering too you
 if the professor is the notable author of a book entitled with a wellknown chapter about bestiality called sex and the single dog of course a researcher might wikisearch 
 all anyone needs to do is to look at your contribution history which parallels mine funny how you just happen to edit articles i have edited in many cases in exactly the same order i have edited them in funny too how that pattern appears to be transferring itself from your ip account to your shiny new registered account (i could of course just be paranoid im sure it is just a complete and utter coincidence that you chose to edit 
 laughably disingenuous every edit of mine is worthwhile and useful if an edit is warranted should others avoid making it because ckatz might object for purely personal reasons 
 actually i have never said you shouldnt make the specific edits more to the point if you had come across the articles in a purely random manner or through a normal progression of editing i wouldnt have anything to complain about the troublesome factor lies in the way you are obviously monitoring the contributions list of an editor you have had a disagreement with and then following that editor around the project to edit the same articles you can attempt to dismiss this with more spurious claims as you have done previously but a simple comparison of our respective contribution histories will demonstrate my concerns regarding your activities on wikipedia 
 would ckatz pretend that was a total coincidence if 
 you may want to look in at the conspiracy theory controversy now raging at the bottom of that page best regards 
 thanks i have looked at it from time to time and have now added my tuppenceworth the idea of careful secondary sourcing rather than opinions would do a lot to improve the article 
 i am intrigued by your comment that argentines is to be preferred as per what argentines call themselves what argentines or argentinians call themselves is argentinos or argentinas and when they are speaking english they will use whichever english word they have been taught the locical extension of what you seem to be suggesting is to call spaniards espanoles there is discussion although it never really reached a conclusion on the talk page about this issue and those adjectives had been left for nearly N months after that discussion unless you have irrevocable evidence that only one of the adjectives or demonyms can be correct it seems reasonable that a mixture remain good work otherwise on the article 
 i cannot consider a conversation that you have had with one person from argentina as canonical it is not necessarily wise to take a snapshot of a wiki page as an authoritative statement on linguistic style but if you consider that valid is there any reason to prefer the content of 
 hi texasandroid would you be so kind as to userfy the article for kurt oldman i have seen in above posts that you can put it in a sandbox is that correct i would like it to go into my sandbox so i can work on it and hopefully bring it up to code with new references the page was deleted N N october N texasandroid deleted kurt oldman uN e doesnt indicate importance or significance of a real person can you please email me at littlepiemusic gmail com instead of this post thank you

 thanks for the comments about the west lancashire league article actually it was my intention to add more information to the new section on clubs progressing from the league eg the year they left where they went etc i may still do this regarding N i will update the divisional members as soon as i get the information 
 hello ckatz i was wondering if you could expand on your rationale for declining the speedy deletion of 
 the categories have already been vetted through a 
 ah but them becoming empty makes them elligible for speedy deletion regardless of them being kept via a previous deletion discussion are you saying that no category after being kept via cfd can become elligible for cN if so i dont think the wording of cN supports that it says anything involved in a current deletion debate not a previous one also such categories for N N etc are also more or less guaranteed to be populated does that mean we should create them now as well i thought the cN criteria was there to prevent premature creation of a bunch of categories like this

 im going to do an awful lot of reading in the next few weeks to improve some of our british articles as many of them are very compromised 
 i have to agree with this user also a nation is a group of people english people are a nation just as british people are if this contracts with a source you have on what a briton is then you need to supply it and then we will have a reword 
 i also agree with you on the 
 my bad i didnt understand your statement at first thinking better it seems a good way to warn people not to edit during the match altough the is not for that is for major edits in the whole article 
 i am okay for that as i stated in 
 seems we have reached a agreement we will try the tag and see how it works great idea 
 im not sure which article you are talking about i deleted a lot of additions of the razzie templates that were added yesterday none of the razzie templates were in use until a new editor added them so im waiting for the templates for deletion page to get straightened out and im going to nominate them i would venture to say that razzies are the only total agreement ever reached at 
 i dont have much of an opinion on the inclusion of photographer credits with the image in articles i have seen it mentioned that the credit requirement is met by it being posted on the actual image page sorry i dont really have much else to say about it i think if the photographer is notable a mention is certainly valid 
 apologies for causing a disturbance there but i was under the impression that colour used in group boxes for teams qualifying by right of the thirdplaced compareoff so to speak is a yellowy colour which i cant remember the hex for but could look up while i admit that i was hasty in my description of my edit and when i made the edit i hadnt yet realised about the thirdplace part still we dont know that mexico will qualify outright in N st or N nd vis a vis we dont know whether we should use green or yellow in such a circumstance i thought it more practical and orderly to leave the colour blank until we actually know where they finish 
 thanks for the speedy reply my point was not so much that we dont know mexico are through i acknowledge that they are its that being the kind of guy who spends his life on wiki as a codemonkey i am under the impression that the established practise for competitions with such a situation as regards thirdplaced teams in the groups the correct colour in the boxes is a yellow colour which you can see the basic idea of 
 in this you removed a reference noting that it is a faq based on usenet posts not a reliable source however in this particular case the issue has been debated quite a lot and there is wide agreement that talkoriginsorg is a rs for example see this 
 hmmm thanks for the tip glancing through that archive it seems to support the use of talkorigins as a rs when the cite is to a particular article and the author can be verified however the page i reviewed is a faq with no indication as to where the material comes form if you have a chance to look over the page in question id appreciate your thoughts on it thanks in advance 
 yes i see what you mean that particular page looks like a typical personal website with no particular reliability i have seen several other talkorigins pages that were by a particular person and were supported with references ( used at

 thank you for your note unfortunately wikipedia has some very strict guidelines with respect to the use of external sites as either references or external links the tvonmedia site does not meet the requirements of our 
 please see the preceding note which explains why the urls are not suitable for inclusion 
 i decided it is best for you to undo the edits i only did one tv on media is a neat web site i have been reading it for years i feel it is just as good as any web site out there regarding tv shows on dvd if anything you should at least leave my edits and to think i was going to donate to the wikipedia foundation i am glad i kind of didnt now jay rogers 
 it is unfortunate that you feel that way but our guidelines on external links exist for a good reason and they are based on years of discussion and debate you are certainly welcome to contribute in other ways of course 
 just wanted to drop a quick note saying welcome to 
 thanks for your help today we should watch for more of the same from this user 
 sorry to vent at you my frustration is with the system or culture and not you personally rest assured that i am not questioning your integrity or motivations 
 while it may seem confusing you need to understand that wikipedia does not treat fictional works as being in the moment a series is viewed in its entirety and as such we list all actors who have had main character status at any point during the run of the series we do not use former or similar subsections and likewise we do not write about characters who have died or otherwise left as being in the past tense this is a standard across all fictional works 
 also doesnt editbotsports break a wikipedia rule about having a name designed to confuse its not a bot it was created and made one edit i dont have the ability to trace ip addresses of users was this done and was there any similarity found 
 they worked around the same time as far as i can see there was only one revert personally editbot should be blocked per the username violation but i warned them for now they only edited once and bots usually have many edits by day one their one edit summary is concerning though a checkuser wasnt run because there was nothing indicative of a sockpuppet the dead giveaways usually include similar edit summaries working against an editor and other odd behavior if anything does start popping up that is suspicious let me know and i will look into it 
 thanks for the quick response please check 
 if its a positive response i dont want

 hi there is obviously more to this than using five instead of seven words making a blanket existential statement about such sets involves an ontological commitment that will rub many readers the wrong way and if the fact about cantorian infinities can be stated in a less combative fashion all the better

 before i saw your comment i left a similar remark at the talk page anyway feel free to contribute there trovatore started a thread 
 the best approach would be to follow the instructions at

 hello tangerines i didnt revert your edits you must have made them while i was editing as there was an edit conflict when i saved my changes which is why it looks like they were reverteddo you want to do what you have to do and then let me know when you have finished so this problam doesnt happen in the future cheers

 can you help me out with this this editor seems very persistent in making the dates mdy despite several other editors wanting it to be in the canadian style of dmy

 most of your edits on argentine football have been good we really need to sort something out for argentine football the coverage is really recentist hardly any of the great players from before the N s have articles also people keep adding and removing players from the current squads without using the players in and players out subheadings and adding seemingly made up players the argentine primera is miles behind even 
 sorry to intrude this is an important issue i am all for creating wikiprojectargentine football let me know how can i help also want to thank both of you for your work with argentine football 
 as to your recent edits erasing any semblance of major part of the

 and here are some good source docs the article is mighty thin on the facts his on his conviction on all counts the recent by the court of appeals and on the decision cheers 
 also i think that that info most certainly belongs in the intro as N the intro is small and can handle another sentence and N this qualifies the information in the intro and the reader should be able to walk away from the intro w or a sense as to the current state of play

 userbox looks good this is coming on quite nicely if you can think of anyone who would be interested in joining you could give them a shout on their talk page keep up the good work 
 i posted your new userbox to my page nice job advertise it in the arg football project page for newcomers to use it if they wish 
 please provide explanation that justifies of an external link i suggest continuing this discussion on the thank you 
 i have provided links to the relevant policies and guidelines on your talk page in a nutshell wikipedia is not a directory service the simple fact that a link exists is not reason to link to it 
 thanks i understand but the link provided primarily covers the area for which the subject of the article is notable (see 
 what do you think 
 im glad you agree but feel free to argue your case if you ever disagree mate i think there are very few players with wikipedia articles in english that havnt played at the top level i think we could always tag average primera players as low until the day that there are multiple articles on players in the lower league at least then we can determine which articles are more deserving of attention as it is now 
 agree or no 
 i have reverted these the source you gave did not verify that numerous instances of moved signs had taken part merely that there was an intention to move some signs in county durham not the same thing at all if there are numerous references on the countrywatch site you should include one which exactly verifies the claim you are making if you cannot find one or more that do so then the supposed fact should not be added 
 sorry i got mixed up with the websites however rather than use weasel words it is better to use the exact figures and make the claims be accurate i hope i have now made the appropriate changes i have made the changes regarding the claim about N which is not backed up by the cited source 
 i typed in an answer and didnt see your later edits to the message the claims you seemed to be making were encapsulated in the reversions you thought should be made that you thought they needed reinserting suggested to me that you accepted them sorry if that was a misunderstanding 
 thanks for your messages i do want to apologise and withdraw any statements i made about you using weasel words and making substantive claims in that article rather than merely trying to sort it out i acted rather hastily and so i need to apologise my only explanation is that i have had a number of wrangles with some countrywatch advocates who distort facts and edit in a non npov way i have been away for a while and came back to see the recent edits and jumpedf to a conclusion i now see is wrong once again my apologies 
 i was considering making an article on his career at blackpool since he is the clubs longestserving manager with details on each season such as the teams league and cup performances as well as his signings and sales reckon it would pass notability 
 but would you just go into detail on his years at blackpool in his current article or make another article entitled for example

 ckatz please could you explain why you reverted my recent edit to 
 i have rereworked that section and would also appreciate it if it could remain stable until we resolve this your changes there are problematic in that they suggest the southern ocean is still a work in progress when in fact it is an active concept in use by the iho and other world bodies any changes would need to reflect that fact which is evidenced by the ihos working groups other marine organizations and even the cia world factbook all of which use the southern ocean terminology given that the oceans project has already seen fit to implement the southern ocean it would help if we could seek consensus for the best wording on all the ocean articles before making changes of the nature you have done to date 
 and also the use by other bodies such as the cia world fact book see also 
 active concept in use by the iho and other world bodies could you please provide a diff or source for that please not the southern ocean talk page standard of i read it in britannica my school teacher my atlas thanks 
 reply there have been as many threads in the past that have shown gross inaccuracies such as the article cited above 
 where was it stated that the cia publication isnt considered a reliable source its certainly in widespread use as a reference source in many articles across the project and i cant see any discussions at 
 your comments and thoughts please 
 i agree that the resolution of this lies in finding a way to present all aspects of the matter with regard to the iho id disagree that that text should be completely removed from the lead we have to consider the fact that they are the defining body for these matters we certainly need to present conflicting viewpoints but we also cannot merely lump them in as just another viewpoint i think you have put forward some good ideas though and will try to respond to them in more detail later today 
 ok then i think the reference to iho in the intro should be something like the 
 sorry but what how exactly is it pov they originally defined the southern ocean in the N nd edition removed it for various reasons in the N rd then voted a motion to restore it in N they have announced their intention to publish it in the upcoming N th edition and it is in use by them and by other reliable sources your rewrite strongly suggests the iho does not officially endorse their own plans which is not an accurate depiction of what is going on at all while the N rd edition is still active pending the introduction of the N th the iho has clearly demonstrated their intention to move forward with the reintroduction of the term and other reputable international bodies have acknowledged this and are proceeding in a similar manner our wording must reflect this reality not obscure it 
 its pov because you are presenting the N definition as a done deal it isnt and its clear that the iho wants that to be their official definition but its not the intro must succinctly reflect this showing both sides of the story perhaps the following wording is better the 
 whatever you folks come up with there is and will a steady steam of news stories running like this http or or wwwabcnetau or news or stories or N or N or N or N htmsectionjustin i am very sure that the average journalist is not going to stick to any arbitrary N degree story whatever you two might sort out most journalists are inherently geographically challenged and lazy and because of that alone a lack of both sides of the story will be to the detriment of wikipedia as the curious will see the sea shepherd story and if they are not careful they are going to find a wikipedia article that tells them that whales and lives are at risk in an ocean that does not exist take care 
 well i have been bold and made the amendments as discussed above hopefully they are acceptable to all but if not then please discuss thanks 
 i have restored the previous version for now while this discussion is moving along the text is still not ready for implementation your version still has issues in that it strongly suggests the iho doesnt support its own concept which is not the case realistically we need to research the status better we know the southern ocean definition has passed a vote and we know the N th edition publication hasnt been ratified the question is whether the lack of publication changes the status of the vote does the iho consider the southern ocean to be official at this time again we need to hash this out probably on the so talk page for greater input and then have an rfc to get more opinions 
 i have had one more go at reworking the text if you are still not happy then we will take it to a wider debate but im reasonably confident that you wont object too much to this one i have removed all reference to official and unofficial definitions instead referring to latest published and more recent definitions 
 driveby comment i like the most recent version as it expresses the ambiguity well a related debate has occurred a few times over whether 
 thanks franamax i have just updated the atlantic pacific and indian ocean articles using similar wording also hopefully acceptable let me know if not 
 i have noticed you are currently active and that is the sole criteria for this message i need a completely neutral party in a debate to take a screenshot of a wikipedia project and upload it would you be so kind as to do this should you decline please do so explicitly so i can pick on another random victim thank you

 i thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve its purpose is there a wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert 
 sorry for the misunderstanding i usually forget about the edit summary but will think about it in the future and about the tag someone should verify if it is really needed as it was placed in february N though article of that size definitely needs more than N references

 i see that you are involved in editing the hooliganism pages i am going either to expand section on polish hools or start a new article anyway i know a lot about this phenomenon but major problem is lack of english sources what would you suggest greetings 
 i do appreciate your help good job i will try to find sources and asap i will expand the article on polish hools i have seen a lot of this stuff with my own eyes and frankly speaking i could write an article without checking any sources btw green street hooligans is a good movie but polish lads had a lot of fun watching it as some situations are totally unrealistic greetings 
 will you do me a favor and add those groups with references i am still having problems with these technical things greetings 
 no problemo will you please look at 
 thanks this article still needs a lot of work i would like to add more info on major disturbances including lower divisions also i will add more info on alliances between firms btw if you like this stuff you should check some flags of polish fans a lot of them are great 
 btw here you can check movies of polish ultras here flags of polish firms browse all pages as this is the forum enjoy

 uhhok sorry but policy is policy 
 im growing very concerned about this 
 since you have evidently not returned to wikipedia and the investigation period on these particular articles is over i have opened a discussion at 
 your actions at 
 sorry but i really do not appreciate such unfair accusations especially since they do not accurately reflect the true nature of the situation i can understand if you disagree but from my perspective this was simply a matter of choosing the best path to avoid an undesirable outcome as you are aware a move discussion was held that led to the outcome that is presently in place keep in mind that this move discussion was closed by an administrator with far more experience in these matters than you or i if you have an issue with his decision by all means take it up with him or reopen the discussion as i have repeatedly advised you to do regardless of my own perspective on the matter my actions are based solely on maintaining an existing consensus the alternative doing nothing and waiting to see if you would cross the line with respect to N rr was not a viable option in my opinion i would much prefer to try to allow the situation to cool down rather than see an established contributor move into a position where he ends up with a suspension of editing privileges this is possible in situations such as

 stuart thank you for the note and for correcting the matter the text was probably initially reverted because of the external links that were added wikipedia has fairly stringent standards for external links as outlined in the

 hey caknuck i took a look at this users edits and they actually do appear to have been valid edits as their unblock request states the text being removed probably should go per wpblp and none of the images are acceptable per nfcc if the user agrees to discuss edits before reverting in the future would you be willing to unblock them thanks for your time 
 done 
 thanks i will keep an eye on them to make sure they dont go back to edit warring 
 as will i if theres any indication of this or if they start deleting content without explanation we should immediately block for at least a week 
 i keep running into you anyway if you need i do see potential for a filter to be devised regarding the harassment you noted at 
 thank you for your note unfortunately the link has been removed because wikipedia is not a directory service and we do not exist merely to list other web sites you have said that execcomp is the leading place for compensation information who exactly has identified it as such what does the site offer that would benefit wikipedia readers and how is that benefit greater than the boost execcomp would receive from being listed here 
 hi carlos im not new to wikipedia but i cant say im experienced it has come to my notice who in the falles article there is a box under the name of catalanspeaking world i seem to think this is unnecessary and it gives a catalan hint to falles i have spoken to the user who created this and to others who are around none of them will listen to my claims and just talk down my suggestions at the end of the day they just give their personal opinion over mine as the only people who are dealing with this are against the removal of this box i can see no way of doing what i think follows wikipedias rule and the reflection of reality my arguments are that this reference to the catalan speaking world should be a link to a category at the end of the article this way it is still included as part of the catalanlanguage world but it doesnt make people who have nothing to do with it think of it as a catalan tradition or have anything to do with catalan i like to think that st patricks in ireland could be included in a englishspeaking world box but this would be irrelevant i hope you can help me out regards 
 i just think this box shouldnt be a box but a category to be added at the end of pages as other languages do not have their world box like this i think englobing other regions or countries under the same name creates the possibility of cases like this where valencia doesnt consider itself catalan but is constantly included as such 
 im going to move this conversation to 
 youd have to wait until he makes a firstteam appearance of course theres nothing stopping you making his article in your sandbox and then moving the information over when his time has come 
 is it still understood his last name is mitcheley not mitchley 
 i really dont know i have never been involved in such a dispute if people want to change the article they can add to the talk page and maybe that will spur some conversation i hate to be such an article hog but my thought is that these two users keep checking in on the article hoping that it will be unprotected so the edit war can flame up again maybe im completely misguided though if you have any questions please contact me at 
 eh i decided to unprotect it at the first hint of edit warring i will protect the article if you have any questions please contact me at 
 im curious about your unexplained deletion of the link to the 
 the harsh edit summary was a response to you not acknowledging my query 
 there is no need to put into 
 ok no worries about the categories my mistake howver this also it is usual to refer to the fylde rather than the fylde with respect i was born in bispham and have lived here all my life i am fully aware of the local name and how to use it 
 well in my experience whenever i see fylde in any publication it is almost always preceded by the rather than the we will have to agree to differ on this 
 try this for more general info on resolving disputes at wikipedia 
 not sure how to procede myself try 
 unfortunately vandalism is not the only problem admins must deal with being disruptive is a much bigger concern as you have found out anyhoo good luck and all again if anything comes up i or anyone else can help with let us know 
 weirdness some of them appear to be unrelated for example the pantaloons guy others seem to be intentionally burying some questionable edits in amongst rather inoccuous spelling fixes this is weird i am going to bring in some more admins on this one 
 the issue was closed as it was determined that there was most likely no connection in the interest of avoiding besmirching the name of what appears to be a decent editor i have removed the links to the discussion that was formerly here 
 hi ckatz one of these accounts is blocked and the other appears inactive so the point may be moot but i suspect 
 thanks and good catch i looked at the contribution the user page and other aspects of the account and your assessment seems bang on please let me know if you come across other similar cases this user seems quite persistent cheers 
 hi again just a followup i think the users ip was probably N judging by the contribs 
 whats the deal with removing the category 
 understood 
 you cannot write text about your own work and reference it with your own pages it is a 
 ah i see where the confusion is now i posted new evidence to back that stupidus maximus is a sock of guildenrich sulmues responded trying to defend him and i responded to sulmues response theres no need for a new spi both the old and the new evidence point to stupidus being a sock of guildenrich would you be so kind as to restore the previous spi 
 whoops thanks for the heads up 
 no problem though its still screwed up would you be so kind as to restore it to its original version cheers 
 i would rather we work to fix this one up as this setup is much better the original one should have been archived and a new one set up so i basically did just that 
 why should the original one be archived there is nothing wrong with it in fact the way it is now it is completely messed up half the evidence is gone and it looks like sulmues is the accused party sorry but i disagree 
 fwiw i agree with athenean the original report was never finally processed and then people just continued adding more details to what remained the same case the original behavioral evidence is still crucial 
 i left a note on the page which i will strike i will also remove stuff in the archive to prevent any disruption sorry about all of that 
 thank you theres now also the new development that somebody found recent ips that clearly belong to the sockmaster a previous cu came out as inconclusive because the sockmaster account itself was stale but with this additional data a new cu checking the sock account against the known ips might be worth it do you think it would be possible to request one 
 yes as i see you already have 
 why are you reverting all of tonyN s edits they are great productive and necessary edits what exactly about them do you object to 
 please see the detailed discussion regarding this matter on tonyN s talk page tony had noted his intention to modify his script to avoid the counterproductive removal of beneficial links while cleaning up overlinking but the script changes appear to have not registered with the system as such the long list of changes continued to introduce more problems by removing beneficial links as it is far easier to redo the valid scriptbased changes once the script is repaired than it is for other editors to manually edit each and every article to repair the errors the appropriate course of action is to undo the problem edits until otnyN can implement his proposed fixes 
 well i didnt see any overt errors with the two i reverted back maybe 
 no problem and thanks for asking id thought i was adding comments to the changes but apparently i wasnt so your questions were certainly justified yes the problem lies in the useful links such as the nbc one you have mentioned that are erroneously removed along with the legitimate changes i have restored the friends version but have left the sttng changes as per tonyN s version after doublechecking it appears that no network info was lost in the shuffle thanks again 
 kind regards 
 better and better i have withdrawn the objection still needs more to get my support i have written a long list at 
 do you want to do the report i will if you wish in the meantime i will block the latest rash of spas 
 i have now opened a discussion at 
 you say nothing specific about whatever personal objection you have i have no problem restoring the tv network link this is rather a waste of two peoples time isnt it 
 unless you are planning on ensuring that the problems your script is introducing are all dealt with problems that are detailed on your talk page than your actions are merely creating extra work for other editors who then have to clean up after your changes in addition you have yet to address the same problems that were introduced into the previous batch of edit you made a few days back 
 as i said i am prepared to readd links to network names in fact on second time through which you are forcing me into i am discovering linked items such as wine and human do you areally want to dilute our wikilinking system with these why are you readding them why english these reversions simply ensure that readers are very unlikely to click on anything you appear to be trying to bring to a head this personal agenda you have been writing at length about on my talk page both currently and in the recent archives apparently other people are objecting to what appears to be destructive intervention i am trying to improve these articles you appear to be intent on dragging them back down 
 i am not at all trying to embarrass you but it is plain to me and everyone else that this is a wppointy exercise by you to stop the work of gnoming editors who are trying to improve these articles do you areally want to ruin the wikilinking by diluting it with utterly useless links such as english and television it beggars belief all you had to do was to raise the network name issue it would have saved me and everyone else a lot of trouble 
 tony as i have clearly and repeatedly outlined on your talk page what you have described as a second pass was in fact the result of errors introduced in the first pass i clearly explained my actions on your talk page i clearly outlined the rationale behind them and i even offered to help you may have good intentions but if the script is introducing new problems at the same time it is correcting existing ones then measures are needed to rectify the situation i did ask you about this a day or so ago when i posted your recent edits to dozens of television series articles have stripped out links to various television networks links which are certainly relevant in articles about series produced by and for those networks unfortunately you resumed use of the script without addressing the problems please note that the articles are certainly not going to suffer from a temporary delay in processing whereas it is unrealistic to expect other editors to have to check over every article to clean up introduced problems 
 that you have been following tony around and reverting all his work while you appear to be in discussion with him about your concern about one particular aspect of the work the linking of television networks there are other valuable component parts of his edits which you doubtlessly do not object to yet you are engaged in blanket reverting as an admin you will not need to be reminded that what you are doing may be considered 
 since we are apparently doing warnings you should note that false warnings are frowned upon and id also add that you are a fine one to speak of stalking when you seem to appear on pages shortly after tony does in an apparent effort to tagteam him one of the reasons why it is important to research events rather than just leap in with fake unsubstantiated warnings is that it helps to avoid posts that make you look foolish even the most cursory of examination of my contributions list freely and easily accessible through my signature in addition to the usual methods would demonstrate thousands upon thousands of edits to televisionrelated articles especially to the main articles for individual series it is hardly stalking when tonyN s actions tonight caused my watchlist to light up like a christmas tree 
 and thank you for adding the link to cbs at ncis which is on my watchlist had i realised you frequently edited tvrelated articles it might have made me think twice about improving the wikilinking and dashes on them lest it upset you however they need to be brought up to modern standards at some stage so best now i do intend to move through more of them so please let me know if theres anything more that you want to raise as specific issues 
 ckatz it appears that you reverted within about a N minute period a series of els i had added to various historical articles on watch companies note that some of these els had been in place for well over a year in each case your revert was made with the highly prejudicial comment rm spam from repair shop site per wpel this behavior might appear to some to be stalking i asked you to explain your reverts on the talk page of one of the articles but no explanation was forthcoming my edits were not violations of wpel and were not spam i would respectfully request that either you engage in a calm and civil discussion of your reasons for the reverts or please stop searching out my edits and blanket reverting them 
 did you make a mistake on protecting

 the reason that i notified you was because you were or are one of the major contributors to the solar system ft consider how much work has been put into creating and expanding that ft i figured you would want to know that one of its most important assets is at risk for being demoted i have attempted to notify as many people as i could think of though so far only

 hi sorry to interrupt new users only get the move tab after a while certain number of edit or time on wikipedia something like that 
 i apologise for our edits getting crossed i would actually point out that my revert was timestamped before your post to the talk page 
 i certainly appreciate the note thank you and likewise for vocalizing my frustrations while i obviously disagree with the changes you made consensus could certainly go either way however my bigger concern is that we exercise more discretion in changing guidelines and policies than we might use in article space 
 you have a point about the potential disruption to fellow editors my edit was actually inspired by and i actually didnt think the merger would be controversial as it was a bit of simple copyediting where nothing of substance was changed the insertion of germane although substantive is unlikely to change behaviour overnight 
 one user was attempting to add sourced material the other was repeatedly reverting it out claiming they were making it up conducting a hoax deeply partisan slandering the subject etc etc i came along after caracharoth 
 not a problem its good to know someones keeping an eye on these things he did helpfully leave me a N rr warning just before you did and just before making his fourth revert which i found quite amusing 
 you have stated that the new template makes things more complicated but you have not explained why it is in my opinion less complicated and less errorprone please explain on the articles talk page rather than simply reverting outright 
 your note summarizes the problem it is your opinion that your method is better at least two other editors disagree per the longestablished 
 it is considered bad mannered to place warnings on pages of established editors you have still not explained yourself and you and now becoming a vandal by performing unexplained or at least unreasoned deletion 
 hi im trying to find a way to make the intro a little more neutral as of now its only a repository of N months old antileno proconan point of view if you can help me make it neutral that would be awesome 
 its actually not too bad i have tweaked it a bit and moved some text further down hopefully that will address your concerns as for the new coke link the two are really apples and oranges im afraid changes to hosts rapid cancellations and the like are not uncommon in television whereas the new coke debacle was something unique in terms of corporate icons and product marketing 
 calling fentanyl a sedative ketamine a barbituate or odessa a russian city is just plain old writer error it has to be documented you say oh but it is see pages 
 i have explained this on your talk page but in short it has nothing to do with the accuracy of your comments instead it is the fact that you are the one making the observations generally speaking we do not note continuity production or other such errors with regard to television series and other works of fiction thee only exception is if said errors become notable in the real world through the observations of

 in reply to this edit summary whats with all the notability challenges apparently you dont think that parliamentary procedure motions automatically count as notable they are rather important to the conduct of business apparently nothing of the sort to be honest the notability tag was a mistake as was the footnote tag we all make mistakes at times and i made them in those tags however all the other tags are still perfectly relevant i was not questioning whether the articles should be created or not if i was doing then i would have placed a deletion tag on the articles and not tags to improve the articles 
 sorry about my tone i will try to be more chill about that kind of thing in the future 
 hey for what its worth if you want to comment here im giving you a heads up 
 i tried emailing you a while back and just now remembered that you cant receive email is that intentionally turned off also if you are interested in commenting here and here if you are interested havent been on much and when i have its been dealing with the vandalism of ttn 
 you have probably i was wondering if it was notable enough for inclusion in the blackpool article im going to mention it in the ms riverdance article anyway 
 id say that it is big enough to form its own article so i will create it suggested title is fine but dont be too strict on the definition of blackpool lytham fleetwood would be a reasonable area of coverage what the article would benifit from is more research offline we have dates or years so a trawl through the old local papers should provide a lot more info does blackpool library have copies of old papers either in the flesh or on microfilm the blackpool gazette may have an archive too 
 would you take a look at the blackpool article there was an edit which removed over N k of material i tried to fix it an seemed to make a mess of it have managed to reinstate the infobox but not sure if there is other material still missing though 
 sorry to disturb you since some days someone writing under a dynamic ip address keeps changing the history section of

 hallo ckatz sorry to disturb you again but the revert rate increased a lot i think that we should contact an administrator and let at least semiprotect the page best regards 
 keep up this work 
 you are welcome 
 hi sorry but i dont think this guy is going to accept your logic or mine better to let him have his playground he will find that anyone with the tools to delete will eventually overrule him bad loser time thanks 
 even better he thinks theres sock activity going on according to his latest edit summary and i bet he thinks you and i are one and the same however i dont go around talking to myself thanks 
 sorry but the second comment in particular was not helpful at all it is rather frustrating to see proponents of mass delinking continually reject ignore or treat with contempt any objections that are raised against their actions then raise spurious complaints about those who raise the objections 
 thanks for the reply you seem confused on the one hand you seem to dissent from the consensus guideline that is 
 hi ckatz you have just reverted my smal addition to time travel on notability i am truly confused why is it done it has reliable references to scientific papers which are also based on previous many years research can you kindly explain what is wrong 
 hello you should post your thoughts on the article talk page to see if other editors feel it is suitable for inclusion after reviewing the text and the related article there does not appear to be wide acceptance for the theory do you have information that suggests otherwise

 thanks for a quick response i agree with you that there was something a bit off with wilderrs edit including the point you mentioned and it probably deserves a followup in fact the inasmuch portion really makes no sense from what i understand the soviet univion did not sign that treaty period i am going to reduct that phrase out of the article regards 
 ah i see that wilderr has just put the inasmuch phrase back in no sure what is going on here regards

 as you may know wikipedia is not a repository for user created images if there is a target article youd like to supply for this image please post it here and i will be happy to restore it so that it can be put in the article if you simply would like to have it restored so that you can retrieve a copy of it for your files it can be temporarily undeleted for such purposes as well

 hi tangerines i see that about a month ago you removed my edits on 
 ok thanks for the explanation i was responding to the same point which had been made over and over again but obviously at different times i will keep your advice in mind in future apologies for bringing up something from a month ago but i havent used the account i opened some time ago that much so it came to my attention just recently again thanks for explaining your actions 
 brian 
 simply put repeatedly removing valid issue templates is not kosher the article is interesting but not encyclopedic in tone and that is not a reflection on the subject but instead on the way it is currently written we are not here to present flowery prose about a subject we are here to deliver clear accurate properly sourced information in an encyclopedic manner with respect to verifiability simply saying everything is true and verifiable along with a long list of books and sites doesnt help a nonresident to verify the claims saying the subject is different doesnt mean that we can dro the encyclopedic style (id also appreciate it if youd skip the silly vested interest claim it makes no sense given my geographic location and serves only to distract from the real issue thanks 
 you ought to be aware that you have been namechecked at 
 no worries if i were you id just ignore it it will go away soon i suspect 
 thank you for your note i see now where your confusion lies you appear to be misinterpreting the expressed concerns as an argument for not including the article that is not the case what needs to be done is that the writing and areferences need to be brought in line with wikipedias standards copyediting serves to rework the writing style layout etc to make the article match other entries peacock terms are overly promotional words and phrases that while appropriate for promotional literature do not belong in an encyclopedia article finally with regard to references you have provided a list of books and links however not all of those entires meet the standards of our 
 tistru noone is suggesting the article should be deleted it requires cleanup and the tags are there to draw the attention of skilled copy editors as for the references it is simply a case of taking the sources identifying which ones meet the 
 im not sorry for accusing grant of this but im sorry he forced me to have to involve innocent users 
 this is one of the weakest and mealymouthed apologies that i think i have ever seen here 
 fwiw i can understand your anger here tangerines and am sorry for having had to checkuser you you have done absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever here yet your name got needlessly dragged through the mud 
 hi would you mind if i asked for a reason for recent revert 
 i think you are misunderstanding the purpose of the main article tag it points readers to an article that expands on the content presented in the section 
 what on earth have you done to this page i was in the middle of expanding or rewriting it as well as adding a picture and not only have you changed it you have knocked off the second half of the page including all the references 
 ok fair enough i didnt see how i did that but when i looked at history and saw another name in among mine i assumed you had done it 
 just spotted the spaces you are referring to sorry i have lost them but they are only visible in the edit do you really need to remove them iv finished for now anyway i might add a bit more to her early career on another day a couple of minor adjustments i made to you infobox i dont think shes at all known as an actress or as a solo artist but im not too worried about that if you want to keep it cheers and sorry for jumping to conclusions but it was a bit of a coincidence 
 chris from your comments on both the comicbook projects page and on aquaman i gather you were a bit upset at the page splits please know that i had no idea creating new articles for different versions of a core character would percipitate the reaction which it has i was unaware of the specific naming conventions and still feel ultimately they would be best served as individual articles but gladly differ to the consensus i hope this difference in view point hasnt strained relations between as since i still appreciate our joint contribution on multiverse and look forward to continued collaboration regards 
 no we are fine i have made much worse mistakes remember this though before you sign up for 
 as for protection it probably wont happen unless the adding is persistent and disruptive as protection isnt used as a preemptive measure but you can try otherwise you might just have to keep reverting as unverifiable unreliable information maybe leaving a quick note with the adder to explain why you have removed it hope all that helps and let me know if i can help with anything else cheers 
 as i mentioned above i think the weekly format is probably the better layout as it provides a summary for each show as the series progresses rather than just listing the information and fits in much better with the overall layout of the article 
 hi i notice that you 
 ok thats fine david suggested a section on cultural references and that would certainly help to justify a separate article 
 wow thats quick work and good too i will take it off my watchlist now but keep up the good work 
 yesvery good work what i think it needs next is a discussion of differences in the movies from the novel i added two phrases which should of course be unnecessary but given some of the objections which are raised around here 
 wrt your complaint to ohconfucius on my talk page you clearly do take offence at campaign etc i dont want anyone to cause offence to anyone but please be aware that your language contains words and phrases that might give offence too and that you tend to personalise usually with reference to me this should stop on both sides if at all possible one of the problems i see is that you dont appear to engage in substantive issues but you take offence even at the last two suggestions i know can you at least acknowledge that these are the appearance to some other editors if you were more forthcoming in discussionuN in terms of the technicalities the nuts and bolts of the issue rather than who changed what whenuN i think there would be more opportunity for productive engagement 
 tony you say you wish to have productive engagement heres a good starting point please stop misrepresenting the people who disagree with you for example you have repeatedly announced to the community that i want to link everything i cannot comprehend why you insist on doing that especially since i have told you that is incorrect many many times i have asked you over and over not to keep making such misleading statements and perhaps most telling i do not actually do anything of the sort im sure you would find it very frustrating if i had been repeatedly telling other editors that you hate links and wont rest until articles are completely in plain text how are we supposed to move forward in such an environment 
 haha no surprise that youd be rooting for jodie cant say i blame you as shed be in my top two as well still id have to go for sam as my nancy id give her a bit of oompahpah if you catch my drift uN 
 fit as she is though i think jessie will probably go out tomorrow before she performed id have said rachel was the favourite to come in fourth but since she got a standing ovation today she might sneak into the final then it will come down to sam and jodie in the final two trouble is i really cant see jodie playing nancy as dickens described her so sam probably will win uN 
 hi ckatz not sure if it is considered improper but i wonder if your recent block of wasnt a bit too mild a couple of days ago they got unblocked from a one year block conditional upon good behavior which specifically involved not redirecting their talk page to main space they have been violating that rather emphatically cheers 
 not improper in the least thank you very much for pointing that out the block should probably be adjusted accordingly cheers 
 ckatz is there a way to get sodapaps to leave me alone i have decided to follow the advise of various editors including you and just ignore him but he continues to badger me you can review his comments here and 
 more of the same today and 
 alright i will leave inamakas and kristi noems talk page alone though a number of those posts are in my defense as inamaka has opened up a sockpuppet investigation on me yes what i posted on his talk page was out of line but i wont apologize for defending myself on the sockpuppet investigation pointing out where he has lied not assumed good faith and shown the same indecency to other editors serves the purpose of proving that inamaka has a history of improper behavior and unfortunately for me i wasnt going to put up with it now if you can close the sockpuppet investigation i wont have to deal with him anymore until that happens i will continue to defend myself on that page and call inamaka out if need be if he cant handle that then he shouldnt have started it 
 borough have their own article which goes into more detail about that specific franchise i kept the early history of borough very brief in the panthers article to avoid the suggestion that the two teams were the same and hence reverted the mini sections 
 i created the blackpool borough page mostly because the history of both clubs was extremely complicated and having too much borough history on the panthers page made it unnecessarily difficult i dont think there is anything on the borough page that would be particularly relevant to panthers or vice versa 
 with regard to the article i will edit it again and try to find a better wording that makes it clear that panthers are a continuation of the club which split from the old borough side 
 hi there i noticed you reverted a lot of refs that were added by a spam account i started a discussion at the reliable sources noticeboard to see if these are actually considered a reliable source or not im not strongly for or against you reverting but they did seem to support the material in the article so i thought i would ask what other people thought feel free to stop by and join in 
 it would be helpful if you could assume good faith rather than making spurious claims please actually look at the edit history where you will note that my contributions primarily involve removing spam links placed by individuals trying to use the article as an advertising opportunity 
 you have to consider whether or not the incident is relevant to a global audience and whether or not it is 
 please note that the pacific is not a documentary it is a television show fiction based in fact is still fiction and as such is entitled to a level of dramatic license if this is indeed relevant to a global audience could you provide an english source while nonenglish sources are allowed it does indicate that no english newsoutlet cares or sees it as a big deal tilting this issue to only a minor audience and giving it undue weight by making it look like a major controversy while from what you type in the section is not at al a major controversy and nbsp 
 it sounds like itd be of interest to me and pools wikipedia articles is it prose or statisticsbased 
 thatd be good i can always check that they concur with calleys stats though im sure they will

 of course we remove sources that no longer verify the information if it isnt in the internet archives then it can no longer be verified the source in question was never a concrete source to begin with it was a scrolling timeslot calender at the end of each year it started over it hasnt been able to verify the season N air dates for N years the onus is on the person or people responsible to verify the it aired a day earlier in canada that season without verification the average reader wouldnt know if the source ever stated what it claims

 tv series continue to exist as creative works even after production of new episodes ceases in a similar manner we would not refer to a book or a film using was 
 then i shall revert myself on an article i previously made the same kind of edit onuN 
 dear ckatz i believe you are behaving in a very autocratic manner and your actions are unreasonable and very narrowminded you have removed the links that i added to some articles published by myself on scribd and asked me to desist from such edits while i appreciate your efforts as an administrator on wikipedia i dissent your such actions my articles quoted substantively from some reputed sources i believe that you went ahead without a minute of thought or after going through the articles this is totally uncalled for and against the spirit of wikipedia i would appreciate that you think about it for sometime before posting a reply 
 you cannot post links to your own opinion pages that is a clear violation of wikipedias guidelines and policies 
 thank you very much acalamari ] 
 you are welcome 
 hi acalamari after consideration i would like to not to be a rollbacker so could you remove this feature from my account its only one click without confirmation dialog so you know i will use edit feature to revert vandalism and misc issues many thanks anyway 
 done if you ever want it back just let me or another admin know 
 sorry to be the bearer of bad news but it didnt take them long to return to their old tricks N undid my undoing of their altering the peter gabriel discography page i almost reverted it back but thought i might be breaking some N revert rule so i left it alone then they made seven edits to a featured article page 
 wow he had a real meltdown there it looks like the admins shut him down before i saw your message but im going to see if i can get an investigation started into the the jmanN N theory thanks for letting me know i like getting involved with this adminy stuff 
 it seemed like watching a tornado tearing through a field the comments on the ip talk page are disturbing and indicative of a lot of unresolved hatred i was just about to update you that the ip is blocked when i saw your reply im glad i contacted you if you enjoy getting involved in this stuff since i neither know how nor really want to be in the middle of a big deal is there any evidence to link jmanN to the ip thanks again jaga 
 ok i put a message on the admin noticeboard i will post here what the result is isnt is all so weird i mean for a peter gabriel fan to act like this i really enjoy his music and would think his fans would be more mellow that this fellow 
 i know what you mean maybe they just picked the page at random or something by the way what could serve as proof that they are the same jman logged in and edited 
 darn i wish id noticed that before my report that really proves it well the admins put a comment on my report saying ip block adjusted so its not anononly which i suppose means all activity from that ip will be blocked which is but a partial victory because the ip was blocked for only one week so i bet we will have another chapter in this saga before its all said and done when he comes back i will use your esanchez example to try to shut the account down for good and get at least a one month block on the ip thanks much for your vigilance he probably would have got away with at least some of his edits if it werent for you 
 im mixed up in this too but hats off to you for knowing what to do and having the guts to do it i guess theres a record of all this brouhaha for anybody who wants to investigate but im grateful for your intervention 
 i wont edit while in use but thought id let you know about this ref if you hadnt seen it cheers 
 no worries if you have firefox you can do rightclick > this frame > show only this frame to give you the frame url not sure about ie but theres probably something similar cheers 
 hey i noticed you added 
 oh also 
 nicely done pain in the arse but well worth it no 
 he still claims his goal in goal was a shot not a cross 
 not so much with burnley fans because they have likely been several times but i wonder how many visiting fans came once never to return what with our high standard of comfort offered which forum did it appear on 
 never mind found it 
 also mind checking the result on N december calleys book has it as blackpool N blackburn with williamson scoring a hattrick the khaki years book has it as N with williamson getting both of pools goals 
 please do not add the tag to 
 the general rule i follow is this if the article discusses anything that is not mentioned in the text of the decision itself it needs additional references or footnotes otherwise additional references are generally unnecessary i hope this helps

 can you provide a link to the previous sockpuppet case sorry but i have closed so many i dont recall this one without a link 
 its not about relevancy its about the number of articles you added the link to (see 
 i know you are trying to be a good little wikipedo and revert supposed vandalism but pointing out an article was plagarized isnt vandalism its trying to bring academic honesty think about that the next time you autorevert things trying to be a big and bad wannabe mod 
 i reverted this edit by you if you think thats a model of how to point out that the article is plagiarised think again if you want to do it properly you might want to investigate the template 
 hi europeN my dear friend have a happy new years and let us remain as brothers thanks best 
 i was just wondering if you have accused doctormasterN of being a sockpuppet why has nothing been done to be honest i have always assumed this user was a sockpuppet of 
 i just realised i already asked you about this but you never replied 
 oh thanks i did see it and i did reply but i did nothing about it i obviously forgot about it and on looking again i assumed you had not replied as i expected you would reply on your own talk page so i apologise 
 and i see you have started an investigation now so thats good 
 i removed the spam tag from this article as it seems to be relatively neutral and not advertising like at all 
 sorry for not signing a brief lapse im usually much more careful 
 i would also like to know if when using twinkle the users talk page automatically pops up because for me it doesnt and it slows down my response i hope you dont mind my questions thank you 
 i am still sometimes unsure whether something has been done intentionally so my warnings may be a little inconsistent until i get a better feel of how things work thanks 
 im not sure about where it should be located to be honest id ask at 
 how about starting 
 it seems we have a disruptive editor betty logan whos reverted edits N times despite you i and another editors consensus i warned her explaining my position and she continually removes the warning from her page id keep a close eye on the article and i think a temp editing ban might help thanks 
 while we are at it maybe a sockpuppet investigation is in order a newly created account seems to have it in for williamsburgland and illazilla the two editors who opposed on 
 it is very suspicious how this terminatron suddenly appeared on the scene reverting yours and illzillas edits isnt it and obviously looking at that pattern i have to admit im a prime suspect either that or someone thought theyd give me a helping hand to get a ban the fact is i have been involved in bigger disputes than this before without resorting to socking so i think maybe it might be a good idea to run a checkuser on both of us i actually think ckatz might have approved of my solutionuN a budget range as done on some of the other film articles and even if he or she doesnt would probably agree it was a legitimate attempt at finding some middle ground 
 didnt even notice and while i concur with betty on checkuser run i do not on anything else no attempt was made to communicate or find middle ground its only now that she has been called on on edit warring that she is interested in solving this dispute amicably 
 ckatz im very sorry for bringing you into this i did not know it would get this out of hand i fully support a sock puppet investigation for both of us to get to the bottom of that issue as for the tN article and bettys removal of content i have said my piece on the talk page and will leave it to consensus 
 i will leave tN related discussions on the appropriate page i brought this up to ckatz because he or she has a background understanding of the issue and i as i told you i wanted to report you for removing an edit warring warning without following the proper channels 
 i can remove whatever i want from my talk page provided it was not left by an admin you were actually breaking the rules by repeatedly reverting on my talk page 
 hi a bit presumptions to revert an admins reverts but it seemed to me that the article is in brit english so day or month format is also appropriate 
 thanks for being weak and having lowered standards with me 
 while i am not miffed i am beginning to get frustrated 
 as you state above i am well known in my field for that reason an inordinate amount of my time is spent unproductively answering inquiries from bloggers students and others wanting basic details often prefaced by a statement such as pardon my request but i looked for you on wikipedia and did not find you the two pages to which you referone for myself and one for my N bookwere created to fill that need 
 as to what happened to your wikipedia article check here
 banhammer is armed and the safety catch unlocked 
 looks like yours went off 
 one wonders why they never stop even when warned hes now got N hours to think about how to contribute productively thanks for tagging in 
 stub assessment is based on the stub tag at the bottom of the article change it if you disagree i didnt read the text past porn actress and so my assessment is necessarily arbitrary 
 thanks fixed 
 so you can change the names of the links contribs instead of edits etc 
 its me again sorry you said i can only seem to click on the extreme left hand side of the search box it was happening to me with internet explorer and i have fixed that problem now copy the last version of my 
 its alright at least you are trying telling me of the fixes 
 i have responded at 
 you might be the person to answer 
 thats nice but you are obviously not reading edit summaries 
 i will get right on that 
 i see that in may you were close to getting an updated toolbar for ff N however ff N is out did you end up getting the beta working and if so did you need more testers or can i test it for you 
 yeah or its pretty much done i was just having problems getting a version working for both N x and N x or N x i have been busy but i still plan to finish it when i get a chance 
 thanks for the pagemove vandalism fix 
 no problem happy to help cheers 
 ah i see you have had to do it a second time any chance you could salt 
 anyway after that he changed target and removed the statement that hagia sophia was converted into a mosque when mehmed entered the church and an ulama pronounced the ritual invocation to allah he pretends that this is clearly pov although this pov comes direct from the slavic chronicle and is reported uN among others uN by runciman and mxfcllerwieneruN he also removed the adjective immediately from the sentence about the conversion since he said that the ottomans needed obviously time to refurbish everythinguN i reverted these changes and answered again but he insisted telling that this is pov and that he wants to change the sentence writing that hagia sophia since N was used as a mosque yesterday he changed again the sentence about the conversion the whole discussion is reported in the 
 in the meantime cplakidas made a proposal to end the dispute which for me is ok what do you think about it anyway after reading carefully the comments of this guy my impression is that he cannot accept the conversion of hagia sophia into a mosque through the procedure used by mehmed but this is what the sources tell us cheers 
 thanks actually i gave up ( the conversion into mosque will be written as pov of the authors who i mentioned to you i think that the opinion of this guy is that hagia sophia always remained a church thanks anyway 
 or as you cleverly called it tv overseen is actually used on a i was unaware she is the leader of a fan club it seems a reputable website with editorial oversight its part of 
 the overmind site appears to feature a large collection of blogs that anyone can sign up to contribute so im not convinced we can use it as a reference source in the particular case of brittany frederick she does not seem to be an authority on reviewing the technical qualities of bluray discs but instead a fan who is ecstatic that her favourite show is now on bluray 
 allright thanks for restoring the review from bluraycom dvd release sections have been criticized for containing just a list of special features thats why i added some reviews would you have any objections for using it for interviews she has done some interviews which i planned to read and add to the article if something interesting came up and nbsp 
 i guess it would depend on the quality of the interviews her blog on the bluray seemed to gush so id be cautious in what she writes about the people as she may have just asked a lot of soft questions 
 good point about the dvd sections by the way i think if we develop them further to include interesting points perhaps about how the presentation differs from the original broadcast for example if it is the only place to find hidef or if the director uses the release as a chance to do the version he or she actually wanted to do originally than we can make them more valuable to the reader 
 the questions asked seem fairly straight forward some of these i plan to add to the production section like how miller became the showrunner for the second season and that mccreary didnt come back for the second season because they couldnt afford a N person orchestra indept reviews would be ideally but unfortunately those type of articles are not that widely available as far as i know the only different thing about the broadcast and the dvds is the enhanced audio mix and nbsp 
 hiplease mark the pages as patrolled after you have patrolled themcheers 
 there will be a button at the bottom of the page saying mark page as patrolledyour friend 
 hey no problem 
 i understand the protection imposition but please note its not been just me whos been removing the nonrs promotional or commercial links which are not valid sources for population claims this kind of thing has been going on in chinatown pages for a long time now one editor a while ago kept on changing the respective san francisco and new york or manhattan chinatown articles in a similar fit of my chinatown is larger than your chinatown rivalry the same kind of problem underlies the undueweight article 
 those two pages are semiprotected because of significant backandforth edits from ips it should not affect you as you are a registered editor 
 hi i have semiprotected the article for one month due to the excessively disuptive editing by the ip 
 all part of the service its regrettable as we get a lot of ips who edit footballing articles and do so responsibly but that kind of disruptive editing is not acceptable 
 get in 
 well 
 i am going to contact the new claimant and if i get a specific reference to a pedigree plus other information will go ahead and put him in an article or two myself years ago there was another male line descendant mentioned as a possible claimant an accountant living in england and he can be mentioned too we will see what if any relationship they might have 
 thank you for care this new claimant have only freeweb pages with minimum informations and without any reliable references 
 thank you for your vigilance he may not be wealthy or very experienced online either of which may explain a few things 
 i did remove the hatnote about water fluoridation i just dont see the particular need or justification for such most fluoride is not used for 
 good point hadnt thought of that thanks for mentioning it cheers 
 fluoride anion took a beating today now water fluoridation is a 
 hello jojan thanks for the nice comment on the chart it is nice to hear that the article originator likes the addition if youd like to support it a bit further and thereby maybe bring a bit more attention to the 
 i voted in your favor 
 hi avenue i was hoping to extend on your good work to get the nz article 
 hi aircorn i have noticed your recent work on the nz article and im glad you are keen to improve it i wont have much time to help in the immediate future (i think other things like 
 thanks i did not even realise the catlins was up for review i will see what i can do to help over there 
 the way i phrased that was a bit sloppy sorry i just meant that the catlins far was a higher priority for me at present not that you should feel any obligation to work on that first 
 no bother it looks like you have it under control but i will keep it watchlisted 
 re your edit summary yes there is indeed reason to remove the full section actually multiple reasons 
 sorry i have to disagree with certain aspects of what you have said while i can appreciate the issues you have identified this is not a trivia section but a section about the characters presented in a series most welldeveloped articles about series will incorporate such a section which is why i felt that the wholesale deletion of the material was not appropriate as you may have noted by now i have started trimming and cleaning up the individual entries to remove commentary and focus on facts i will need assistance from editors who are more familiar with the show in verifying some details from show content 
 that being saidwhy was it reverted i am quite new to this and it seems to me that i located an error and rectified it only to have it reverted within hours did i miss some protocol 
 not that im accusing you of vandalism 
 thanks for the advice on editingi wasnt aware what the edit summary box was for and will use it in future also i would like to compliment you on your bmp rewrite i was clicking around on your user page and found what i thought was your rewrite and noticed a couple of errors that i found you have already fixedonce i found your rewritespecifically with regards to its amphibious capabilities anyways thanks again 
 i agree with you on this one megapixie re the 
 see discussion on your talk page 
 with respect to your edits and i will continue to 
 please join the discussions instead of just reverting 
 actually you were the one removing them it would have been best to stop when you were initially reverted instead of removing the names repeatedly 
 french isnt an official provincinal language of pei or bc so the provincial names shouldnt be in french until a provincial source is provided 
 the section in the infobox doesnt say official provincial langauges it says official languages in canada both are official 
 in that case english should be added to 
 the article has recieved a rewrite and i have given it a serious beating with the npov hammer you might wish to take a look at it again and see if it deserves a keep on vfd 
 see 
 why dont you add something about it to one of the articles under 
 see 
 the only change to the page from two days ago is changing colombia to columbia your comment doesnt make sense in like of that change 
 excuse me the change i fixed was to link the terms separately in order to avoid using 
 hey i cant see the history page of 
 there doesnt seem to be anything to see there were no edits to that page since N april 
 athenean wrote interestingly the file zappajpg was recently deleted an attempt to cover ones tracks perhaps i would be areally interested to find out who deleted it and why 
 making edits vanish without a trace would be extremely difficult to do uN only full 
 i was not surprised that the collapse was reversed but i was taken aback that would be the reverter we have our difference but this passage i tried to collapse is but 
 oh stop being such a prig your hide was rather selective in that it covered over the rationale please try and be a bit more objective and a bit less censorial cheers 
 oc your hide was unwarranted and also rather selective so too was your post at an or i especially since you chose to ignore the incivility and sidetracking perpetrated by some of your compatriots on the linking page however i do welcome any outside attention that the an or i post might bring to the real problems on that page 
 hello this message is being sent to inform you that there currently is a discussion at 
 thanks for the notification i have responded there 
 in where did you move the information on action in sociology 
 good spot i have created a new mini article 
 please make any changes you see fit you have to admit that its a lot easier to find the actual links on the page now good luck 
 actually i had some time on my hands and i reshuffled a little please make any further changes as you see fit thanks 
 while you are at it checkout cpmN for and editable item 
 any chance you could take a few photos and post it on the pages about darlington and dig out a few dates for the building i came across the article whilst on 
 thanks i appreciate that 
 interesting stuff thanks for taking the time to type it out we will have to see what happens on a completely different tack i did a lot of collaboration with a guy on here who was N very helpful and N unusually knowledgeable he got banned over some silly issue an outrage really given the amount of useful and eloquently phrased material he gave to the project id like to get in touch with him but obviously cant as an admin are you in a position to say find an email address 
 thanks i knew youd know something covert 
 nope never come across those neither must really get back to my work but thanks for the tips i will have a good look at them later on 
 thanks 
 hello thanks for posting i have since restored a mention of the organization minus the overly prsounding parts if you can find thirdparty analysis or commentary on their work it may warrant expansion please feel free to let me know if you need assistance or have any other questions thanks again and welcome to wikipedia 
 however i would still recomend using a somewhat smaller as described in the link above png image or at least use gif instead of jpg jpg is probably the worst possible format for somethihg like 
 i saw your edits to the page of the 
 hi rorkadian thanks for the friendly note it pained me to remove those names because i thought it would hurt some feelings but i knew the list wasnt in line with wikipedia guidelines 
 im sorry you thought removal of links constitutes vandalism i of course disagree otherwise i wouldnt have done it the reason was i was editing 
 thats fine thanks 
 hi ckatz i dont want to revert your edit again on 
 no shouldnt end that way i will post to the talk page and we can see what the result is fair enough 
 sure that sounds good thanks 
 hey thanks for your great work on the article someone will have to upload the wwi photos to the commons too 
 no problem thanks for the great photos the wwi photos are a bit iffy some of them i have seen on various webpages could be post wwi i think the mN was used into world war ii without definate sources it is difficult to say if there are pd or post N i will keep an eye out for some photos with more definate attribution keep up the good work 
 well at least those where soldiers wear austrian uniforms might safely be used dont you agree 
 probably im going to go with a tentative yes 
 noticed you removed the prod on 
 no objections i should have been clearer in saying that a redirect would preserve the work done so far formatting userbox etc that a deletion would eliminate thanks for doing the redirect 
 while you have cited certain aspects of the blp policy please note that you err in saying that it is your page wikipedia pages are not the same as personal pages on a subjects own web site and the subject cannot dictate what information is and is not displayed also this request is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have presented some of this information such as your place of birth in your own books finally while they may possibly be room to accommodate your request any such request would need to go through the foundation so as to privately verify that you are actually who you say you are 
 i don not now how you think an official german patent could be faked but i think it is allmost impossibel if you are in doubt you shouldnxbN t start aresearch with something like google google give you just mainstream ideas not the worst think if you want to now whats up to date on the billboard charts but this is something different i came up with this idea while i saw a N drawing af a german fighter project to me it looks area ruled but i did not found any hints about a german invention then i saw the name in 
 can you site something reputable either another website or a publication that i can fact check this in otherwise this looks like it might break 
 i will reword the article slightly to reflect the information one thing 
 can you comment on that 
 as indicated in 
 however as per past discussions the encyclopaedia uses the international iho terminology as evidenced by the respective articles it would be confusing to have the newly added navbox using a different term from the articles i have reworked your note to reflect what the related australian articles use would it help with your concerns if we put under the indian ocean entry 
 actually i went ahead and tested such an entry i then reverted it out but you can see it 
 i found that whitcomb invented the 
 which would seem to support them not being winglets however i dont think the case is closed on this one im looking for some sources that cite whitcomb as the inventor 
 the name of N winglet inventor was fw lancaster 
 on the family research council page there appears to be consensus about the inclusion of the splc designation as a hate group in the article lead yet warnings are being issued for edits including info on this designation are being issued for disruptive editing and vandalism why 
 one you need to let others make that call as a new editor you will need to work to avoid being considered a 
 it appears that others have made that call no one is currently disputing wording similar to what i added and a supermajority of those who discussed past wording support wording similar to mine it makes sense that new editors would faced increased scrutiny but the scrutiny should be based on the content rather than on the fact that an editor is new considering that my content simply provided a slightly expanded explanation of the splc hate group status that is already noted in the lead that the discussion on the inclusion of similar wording is hugely in support of wording such as mine and that no current editor is actively disputing such wording i do not understand what the issue is i should also note that the frc page is not the first page i have edited and nor were my other edits in the same topic area perhaps i am mistaken but it appears you basically are saying i cant edit the frc page because i am new everyone is new at some point and i certainly hope most new editors do not face what i consider to be undue burdens to editing 
 whithcomb again was named as inventor of the supercritical airfoil please have a look at http or or wwwdlrde or dlr or luftfahrt or dokumente or forschung_fuer_die_luftfahrt_einfachpdf in there you can see ie a plane with wing end plate but search for xfcberkritisches profil there was research going on N by dvls ka kawalki leading to subsonic profils very similar to the supercrtical profils invented later question did whithcomb probably found the secret nazi aerodynamic files 
 ps i just reorganised this section a little have a good new year 
 on behalf of 
 nice surprise thank you tony 
 hi ckatz im not too bothered about this but you just deleted nominated this as cN but there hasnt been an afd afaict 
 it appears to closely resemble 
 ah i see i had noticed that afd but didnt realise it was essentially about the same thing out of interest since i 
 first of all i was pointed to the fact that my previous article 
 it has been revised and redone quite substantially amounts to an acceptance that it is a reworking of the same article not a new article even though its ostensible subject is different yes it was rewritten and expanded but the rewriting did not address the reason for deletion a fact which editors who come here to write about a subject dear to their heart often fail to grasp is that notability is a property of the subject of the article not of the article itself no amount of rewriting an article will turn a nonnotable subject into a notable one 
 first let me say thank you for taking the time to look i will try and contact famspear or bdN though primarily wiredtape is a processes and procedures site it also needs and has place for editorials and information articles such as articles explaining the terminology behind a procedure or valuation of a companies i hope you feel these are more up your ally 
 hi megapixie i have moved the information from 
 thanks 
 if i can help in any way 
 thanks for the offer would it be ok if i ran the structure by you before i put it in the article i think i know how to draw it based on your description and some research i have done 
 looks good the point is always where to put the charge in the organic molecule 
 right you are uN i assumed that they were pompoms because i looked at the 
 belfast would originally have had pompoms also but was refitted and reconstructed in the N s and has been repainted into her wwN colours despite being in a more modern guise 
 since i wanna go to bed and you are the only admin i know up right now can you protect the article for 
 semiprotected for two weeks can be extended if the problem returns thanks and sleep well 
 aha thanks and what that ip was doing wasnt edit warring or content disputes that was sheer vandalism just put in sarcastic form just letting you know since i read the description you filed it under uN 
 noted and i have updated the rationale cheers 
 next time delete your request at rpp too p 
 wikipedia isnt a business directory please read 
 probably its likely some were created before the guidelines were implemented that doesnt mean they are immune to deletion just that the deletion requests should be submitted via 
 on another talk page i found an image comparing the fN or N to the mustang i think this would be a good addition to the area rule page two updates though first it should real fN not fN another would be to add a sample curve for the searshaack body which is essentially a half cigar you can find that on google easily enough thanks 
 okay but im basically making the area under the curve up give me a few days cheers 
 in retrospect maybe that image of the comparison of the fN before and after would be better as it is both illustrative and historically interesing i will have to see what sort of licensing it has 
 wants to interview three members of the solar system wikiproject since there are only about N of us i thought id check round to see if anyone was interested 
 sure why not maybe it will get some more regulars involved 
 heya i was wondering if we could have a N in front of azolium cation and display it once only also since you have drawn it perhaps you can calculate the formula and mw and enter it in the chembox thanks 
 sure but where should the N be and how large should it be im pretty inexperienced with drawing salts 
 if bkchem has brackets perhaps you can use the bracket around one cation and subscript N in chemsketch it is the polymer tool 
 i checked it does my original files are on an inaccessible computer right now but when i get to it i will make the change i guess i will just put a bracketed cation centered on top i will drop you a line when i update it 
 first the thanks i apreciate your help with the picture of the soviet battlecruiser kirov i had no idea that it was in the public domain that was a very pleasent suprise and now the question would you mind taking a look at 
 be careful assuming that everything on fas is public domain not everything is good luck 
 hi thanks for starting some articles i was getting a bit worried that id have to write them all up myself i dont suppose you are planning to do more including some on the surface fleet either way if you could dig up some pictures for the surface vessels that would be great i dont know where to look for pictures that arent copyrighted 
 nice thanks for the headsup lets both work on the articles if possible 
 i was wondering why i couldnt edit the list of micronations article to correct the alphabetical order was i blocked 
 the problem lies in some of the language used as it was nonencyclopedic and rather loaded as well several of the references used were unacceptable as they were from blogs and or or opinion pieces i have now reworked the material to bring it into line 
 just noticed that you reverted my addition of a section technology as in technology behind the show chuck back in N the information i provided was simple to understand clearly written factually based and linked only to other wikipedia articles please explain by contacting me directly 
 thank you for your help seems my wording was not the very best 
 i have already replied to this request at 
 hey was wondering if theres any chance that you could slightly reedit the univision framing image so that it reads univisium instead of univision storaro changed the name of the format shortly after he realized the name was already in use by the tv network univision and all subsequent interviews with him refer to it as univisium i have corrected the article but the image still retains the old name thanks 
 done let me know if there are any other changes to the film images or new images cheers 
 i noticed you again emptied out countless categories containing the word organizations (using 
 and your talk of the community when you rammed this down everyones throats a month ago without a single piece of consultation and until our engagement late last month i think you had N talk page credits to your name over your entire wikicareer is amusing to say the least 
 i have no idea why you continue to bother with categories oic the entire process for managing categories is fatally flawed and quite simply corrupt and there is nothing that will fix it save root and branch reform until then you would have more chance of reasonable discussion with the wall participating in the process only legitimises it 
 nah its a bit more complicated than that 
 hiya im not sure why you made reversion on the 
 in fact i see several places where you have reverted edits that werent clear vandalism please can you start using undo rather than revert in such cases 
 please see the 
 im unsure as to why you believe the two sources i cited were for promotional purposes i know im new here but they point to a wellresearched reliable article and i adhered closely to wps guidelines re pov spam external links etc i have undone the reversions and await your response with kind regards 
 the promotional aspect appears because you appear to be connected to the articles given that your account name is the same as the reference name you chose if this was simply a case of using your own name to name the reference then please disregard however the site you linked to clickheredummy does not constitute a 
 careful you just created the lcm page twice i have redirected the new one to the older but you can switch it around if you want 
 thanks i came accross an old browser window and i noticed it wasnt saved so i saved it not remembering id decided to change the name at the end of writing the article thanks again 
 sorry forgot about your request until now but i have made some comments specifically that common topline is the preferred method for multiple aspect ratio extractions not centered extraction i have also left some references that should make it clear however make certain to notate in the image the extraction method used as there is no strict standard thanks 
 i should get a chance to fix it in the next N hours i will see if i can fit in both methods into the same diagram 
 please could you confirm your interest in being interviewed by the signpost 
 thanks would you be able to answer 
 could you answer the questions please 
 hey wondering if you might be up for the challenge of doing up another graphic dont know if you have been to 
 i will take a look im not an admin though cheers 
 i know its a small thing but i think an encylopaedia should have the exact info yours 
 we would need a definitive source to illustrate that the period is in fact considered a part of the title abcs official schedule does not incorporate the period as part of the title i have reworked the lead accordingly 
 ok fair enough i will try to come up with something 
 thanks for the info 
 it is both 
 id love to work with you or another editor to make sure this of course is done in a matter in line with wikipedias practices im beginning a page privately in my account to begin with since its my first thanks alex 
 the site does not appear to meet the requirements for an article and there have been more than half a dozen accounts created solely to promote this site unfortunately yours appears to be yet another one 
 we have both said our piece on him but moniN has poked out a fairly stong work and this is a monatge of a wide variety of old sources a number tie in with velxeN zquez thus me here im mentioning this as you were always extreamly sharp at making connections and tieing things together and would be invaluable in an article like this so in other news all quite no other news preoccupied by dxfcrer but thinking of making a pass at bacon 
 i will check it out 
 although not nearly as nice 
 yeah those are not as good let me know if you can xbN 
 i have just been trying to trace some changes to the nbsp section of mosnum and came across the diff surprisingly fails to show the introduction of a of nbsp text please be clear that im not making any accusations that this change was done by you without consensus just that im mystified how it doesnt show up i can see mosnum was a mess at the time of your edit sandygeorgia there was a discussion that nbsp were never considered as necessary or desirable do you recall such a discussion 
 ah that edit that was when i transcluded part of the guideline so that we could lock it unfortunately what was revealed afterward was that it can make the diffs rather hard to read because you seem to end up with a mix of the diff from that date for the material in the page you are reading and the diff for todays date from the page that is trancluded edits seem to disappear from the history even though they are clear in the actual page content 
 thanks for the explanation 
 nsrN thanks and thank you for working on the actual content that part can actually be useful too 
 i reverted this since now the sentence made little sense and seemed to reverse the meaning of the original sentence could you explain what the idea was its possible that it made the same statement as before but just in a overly complex manner 
 climate change denial as it is used in the article is about disinformation campaigns created by people with a hidden financial interest in keeping the status quo where as your sentence seems to say that it is a campaign trying to show science as having hidden financial interests have i misunderstood 
 thanks 
 i have fixed the formatting for you and transcluded the request in the list of deletion debates started today 
 thank you for your help i really appreciate it 
 at 
 yeahi dont have photoshop do you 
 how about the black areas if its a bright white jet it is going to be ff ff ff thoughts 
 well with the exception of the rivets these are smooth areas painted over in white there is no texture to speak of and in the sun extremely little variation in the coloration of the fuselage in short i think its fine and representative of the subject of the photo 
 im not really sure that let the reader guess is all that satisfactory though if i didnt know anything about the publication and came across that article for the first time one of my immediate questions would be why did publication cease in N annuals dont just stop after over half a century for no reason i do think we need if at all possible to add some sort of explanation was there any sort of announcement made in the hindu or article noting the end of publication in any other indian newspaper 
 thanks for your reply not selling enough copies would seem plausible certainly its a shame that indian cricket is such a difficult title to search on 
 see the list of episodes which describes how the nine episodes intended as a seventh season were merged into the sixth season you are doublecounting those nine episodes 
 i was in the process of adding 
 done thanks for the note cheers 
 i would be more than happy to unfortunately examinercom is blacklisted by wikipedias spam filter so i thought i would merely list the title to the interview 
 thanks for the quick response fyi the regs for sourcing material for 
 i am concerned by your edit of course its fixable but it is also unsourced and a 
 these pages were all turning up on my new edit filters and i was only doing the minimum npp work to nuke the very bad stuff i didnt put enough time into the false positives which appeared in the edit filter logs i have now fixed that aspect of 
 thanks for the explanation and the fixup if you could edit filter out the unreferenced article creations think it could solve the autoconfirmed to create rfc issue that seems to have polarised editors cheers 
 oddly enough i didnt know about the rfc until looking at cent earlier today using an edit filter will allow finer control over the thresholds and other implementation details and it can be gradually implemented 
 if oprah is on that list and her show isnt over yet theres no reason why all my children shouldnt be on that list
 thanks i have fixed the oprah article the category is only applied once the final episode has aired 
 it would be nice if show log were one of our configurable options i like having as much screen as possible to look at the diff so i uncheck show log at the beginning of every session 
 godd idea if this isnt already done i will do it added to google code bugs 
 this is fixed in the next version 
 sweet thanks for the update 
 the decision to delete or not will be up to an admin not me you should add inline citations to establish 
 the decision whether to delete or not isnt mine i just tagged the article so an admin can review it i tagged it because there were no references of her 
 good hello if you have a moment could you take a look at this 
 thanks im familiar with the bmp and brdm series but this is new to me thanks again and thank you wikipedia for teaching me something new cheers 
 is there a way to edit the name to bring it into line with the other sov afvs 
 please explain how the larmenius charter is itself a selfstyled order of chivalry when it purports to be a document related to the actual knights templar 
 it can be argued that the larmenius charter served as the starting point for the creation of fabrepalaprats order without it the order would not have been founded and since its not a genuine templar document it fits into the selfstyled category 
 it can be argued is not the same as is i can argue the moon is made of green cheese but plenty of reliable sources will prove me wrong so is this speculation or fact 
 lets say its factual that the larmenius charter and fabrepalaprats order were cognate and that both fit into the selfstyled category and that the majority endorse this 
 note that while pages may sometimes initially be posted by an agent or other such representative once posted they are subject to the standards expected of all articles there is no ownership permitted and articles cannot be rewritten to suit the desires of the subject or their pr representatives 
 i negotiate for a living when there is something controversial that is covered in other arenas that is going against established norms and practices it is the first thing taken off the table i urge you to consider taking a truly neutral approach as i did and remove the rt scores unless you wish to research and insert the same information into every other directors biographical page 
 im presuming that you are oneandthe same as 
 then you should include the entire critical response from the films page it contains all the negative scores as well as quotes from bad reviews middling reviews and positive ones either that or leave it all out and stick to the facts about mr glatzers life that you link one positive review is irrelevant to the reader who is unlikely to click on N different articles 
 well the first link is to the rt page which includes all of the reviews by the way the fact that his film had such an exceptionally low critical reception is certainly a relevant fact about mr glatzers life one that is certainly more notable than the release date for the dvd 
 thanks for your help with the images when i uploaded them i followed what had been done for the photo of 
 im also curious in the general case when is it acceptable to photograph and post a copyrighted image i posed the question on 
 the one that bothers me most is the main picture in 
 but why dont you participate and say what you have to say after all i dont want to monopolize the article 
 i have restored the changes with the rationale noted in he edit summary it may not have been clear but my edits did not remove all of your changes some were kept some were reverted and others were trimmed for brevity noone will doubt your efforts 
 thanks for the note i will look into the matter and let you know where to apply for the change please feel free to leave me a reminder if you have not had a reply in a week or so in case i am busy cheers your translation was not a problem by the way i hope mine is also acceptablemerci pour cette note je vais xeN tudier la question et vous laisser savoir xeN qui sadresser pour le changement sil vous plaxeet nhxeN sitez pas xeN me laisser un rappel si vous navez pas eu une rxeN ponse dans une semaine ou deux au cas oxfN je suis occupxeN cheers votre traduction nxeN tait pas un problxeN me soit dit en passant jespxeN re que le mien est acceptable 
 i do not have a strong opinion one way or the other 
 ok cool 
 hi ckatz thanks for your feedback and edits could you clarify your removal of recently posted content on the 
 the information about the award was in fact retained however it was reduced to the essential details that relate to the tower and moved up a bit the other material was more related to your company and was not needed please keep in mind that as an employee of the company you do have a 
 megapixie i left some more q there pls ansrwer them you have answered about logo with rational but no source but i mentioned there term theft please clarify that one toothanks 
 i left message 
 same thing with if they redistribute the image as part of another work they license that work under the creative commons attributionsharealike license or a compatible license can you please bit explain to me i will be happy for that 
 please visit 
 hiya sorry about that i hadnt looked at your previous comment regarding the waterloo road cast thanks for changing it but surely its pointless having cast there that havent been in the show since N not moaning just saying thanks tho 
 no problem i appreciate you taking the time to reply wikipedia articles treat a series as a complete body of work instead of a collection of individual events essentially we document the entire run instead of being in the moment an actor who serves in a main role is thus always represented as such and is not relegated to former status hope this helps 
 hi i dont know that we have spoken before but you came to my attention somewhere and id like to get a few more people looking into this basically i want to nominate 
 thanks for your help there i will be spending the next few days putting some of that into the article by the way i actually spent about a week in barnstable around N years ago nice place the only downside to the whole trip was our decision to drive there from boston on a friday afternoon in july
 if only you had planned the trip this year i would have told you to turn around and never come that weekend if you have any other questions feel free to ask as i apparently know a ton of useless information about the state 
 please clarify a bit regarding on this image 
 that imho would be replaceable fair use the image itself isnt being commented on criticially and it isnt essential to the article but not everyone agrees on this interpretation of policy see 
 placing you in violation of N rr i would urge you to undo your last revet and remain engaged on the discussion page if you choose not to do so i will be forced to escalate the matter you cannot convince anyone of the strength of your arguments via revert indeed if anything it simply clouds the issue with a strong desire to put another person into a very small box and kick it around the room 
 i would say that it is really a mistake to resort to heavyhanded threats like that not only are you somewhat misrepresenting the situation but it unnecessarily adds tension to the discussion please note that you are the one who removed the longstanding text that is in fact supported by the reference because you erroneously thought the link was dead and you are the one who repeatedly deleted text three times after that while i may have restored my attempt at compromise a second time my subsequent edit involved rolling back to the existing consensus version so that we could discuss the matter on an even footing honestly the best and most proper approach on both our parts should have been to properly respect 
 my apologies if you thought i was heavyhanded i simply asked you to revert had i been what i consider to be heavyhanded id have simply asked you to revert wait N hour and report you to anew note that i did not do that but instead came here privately to allow you to selfcorrect trust me had i felt the need for provocation we wouldnt be talking here now even though you chose to forego that gentle reminder i am going to still work with you in discussion to resolve the problem this despite the bit of good faith that you have lost here 
 thanks i just noticed this little rollback link in my histories and was wondering what that was for i think it will make things easier 
 you are welcome just remember its for vandalismreversion only good luck 
 or styleverticalalign top bordertop N px solid gray or i hereby give you this award for dealing with 
 was previously nominated and contested via nominated via for futher discussion thanks and mdash and nbsp 
 thanks for the info i hope this could be more constructive than previous attempts but unfortunately it seems its not having a good start 
 please discuss this with me further i will revert the edits on N mar N if i receive no response 
 i am going to revert 
 you reverted my changes in the article and requested for sources but i dont get for what sentences sources are needed could you explain 
 hi im disappointed that you removed my image about postal commemorations of 
 i didnt think the stamp really belonged there i will give it another shot 
 nice it looks much better that way im glad you decided to keep it thank you for your patient effort and precision 
 among other things the hip is too big should be the length of the sacral neural spines and more rounded the caudal verts are way too skinny and the pose of the forelimbs makes it look like its playing the elbows out which was not possible the hands also should be completely vertical 
 well the thing is skeletal diagrams arent art they are schematics so theres virtually no room for interpretation in a wellstudied specimen compare any bone you like to hartmans and if it isnt pretty much identical it needs to be fixed a few more that pop up as i look at it the feet need to be more columnar not flattened he scapula needs to be broader and the femur should probably be a tad longer the neural arches on the sacral vertebrae should be taller the pubis looks pretty off did you base that on a different specimen might just be variation this is more biomechanical but the shoulder girdle and forelimbs should probably be brought posterior a bit so that the scapula covers up the first rib i think thats about it except maybe the posture of the tail if you notice the joints between the caudals are slanted on yours whereas most skeletals and mounts i have seen have them vertical the slanting is necessary to make the tail curve at the base in yours but its likely the tail just couldnt do that oh and the skull looks a little too elongated you might want to squish up the posterior end and shrink the orbit 
 what did you use as your original reference i think scott copies his bones directly from published figures in most cases you could always go that rout for the problematic elements in yours i believe he has a tutorial up somehwere but i cant find it 
 also i wonder how much you can actually mimic a copyrighted diagram aside from the black outline the bones themselves are a known data point with no artistic interpretation i wonder how people deal with things like graphs etc seems like that would be more a parallel 
 re what is the justification for the blacklisting pd is banned as an editor but is there reason to believe those pages have been abused 
 re the above damian has repeatedly used ip socks to edit the sum of logic page he has also indicated through his actions and his posts that he has no intention of stopping this behaviour or to stop trying to get links to his site 
 ah thank you my apologies for not reading upwards i will need to be less trusting 
 well done on the image i have one critique though the bh perf is wrong its N from middle of the sides to the opposite top corner i dont know why its defined like that but that is how it is thanks 
 okay i must have used a bad source then i would agree that deference to kodak probably is best thanks for that 
 good daytime may i ask you to help with proper english grammar in the 
 great thank you for your work some minor remarks considering the article i have added links and some info to the nonobvious facts and in trivia item no N about finnish museum is not so trivial finnish forces captured a lot of very rare guns which are now in museums but dN was not so rare such as tN light tank for example but finns cannot capture it in good conditions or buy it in peace time later and now how we can request reassession for aclass 
 as for the trivia item in question i dont find it interesting enough or special enough imho it should be removed 
 even with your reworded sentence the opening paragraph gives the false impression that this is something that is more than likely to happen whereas from what i gather there is very little hope of it actually coming to pass has been introduced fails to convey the fact that there is little support and i feel this is slightly misleading 
 the problem isnt the importance of the bill or how much people talk about it its the fact that the lead gives the impression that this is it the problem is that for those with little or no knowledge of us politics has been introduced makes it seem like the matter is settled as for state the facts the intro is pretty long and gives an exhaustive description of its popularity but fails to convey that this is still a minority opinion this may be blindingly obvious to americans but us aliens have no frame of reference here 
 or styleverticalalign middle padding N px or for helping against the edit warring on 
 no problem 
 i will investigate through the television project but the convention is to avoid years furthermore we would not use season one but instead season one 
 is there any consensus on whether or not the year can be added to the section headings in television articles 
 greetings there is a debate at 
 yeah i left that note back when i thought a show of consensus would improve things now i guess nonfeeding is best thanks and ndash 
 i asked him to give me his permission to use suN images taken by him on wikipedia and he accepted thats all i dont mind if you change the copyright tag into a proper one im not an expert on image copyright tagging 
 but we are not going to modify the image right why we are supposed to modify it this is becoming really stupid if the permission of the author isnt enough to post an image on wikipedia no offense 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or some of the stuff on 
 thanks i was just wondering if anyone was ever going to run into that and appreciate it 
 wouldnt an tag be acceptable for him and for us is there any solution to keep the image on wikipedia 
 ohh ok thats it looks like we will have to find another cockpit image again how are the images supposed to be modified 
 i noticed you fixed the first sentence in the newfoundland and labrador it sounds much better and was wondering if youd be interested in rewriting the introduction for 
 thanks for the feedback im glad that the tweaked version works for you id be happy to take a look at the intro you mentioned over the next few days please feel free to remind me if i forget cheers 
 just giving you a reminder 
 thanks check out the rewrite and let me know if it works for you cheers 
 i should have mentioned looking in the talk page at the assessment of the article that was done the person who assessed gave some tips and said the lead needed to be expanded with more information i wasnt sure what to be putting in though 
 simply put it is not suitable content the page is intended as an overview of the concept not as a site to highlight specific businesses however you are encouraged to contribute in areas where you do not have a direct conflict of interest please feel free to ask if you would like assistance in doing so cheers 
 the above editor is indefinitely blocked by arbcom who have made no comment on the preferred state of the userpage i suggest that you request guidance from that body before changing the page i would also note that you edited through protection where you should have found consensus before making non controversial edits for the sake of clarity i am the admin who placed this protection to stop exactly this sort of edit warring and have reverted your edit 
 feel free to revert if you must a few thoughts though one it is most certainly not uncommon to blank or otherwise remove that sort of information from blocked or banned users two the edit in question can in no possible way be defined as an edit war alison changed the material someone else reverted her goodfaith change it drew my attention and i removed his contact information i think a more appropriate question would be why it is necessary to keep a series of links for a banned user 
 kohs is blocked indefinitely per the notice on his page not banned indefinitely blocked editors may return providing they are deemed to be able to be useful editors again the page has was left in the state it was following the arbcom decision and it was the subsequent edit wars that lead me to protecting it of import more than the unilateral decision to remove the content was that your action was made through a protected page where it is expected for there to be consensus before making a controversial action 
 note that an indef user who no admin will unblock is effectively banned especially when one factors in that kohs was unblocked and then reblocked several times there is also nothing out of the ordinary in blanking offsite links from the pages of such a user after all the external links and sites were a definite factor in the original blocks 
 there are those admins who would unblock kohs if he were to undertake to comport himself according to wikipedia practices kohs was blocked indefinitely again because after a trial he declared himself not bound by wp policy practice and guidelines some of the links he desired to be allowed were a symptom of that rejection but it was his rejection of the conditions that allowed him to resume editing that was the primary reason for his editing privileges being withdrawn 
 maybe an mfd would be appropriate and nbsp 
 probably although my participation would be to question what leverage any community consensus would have on an arbcom ruling 
 did the arbcom rule on his user page i see that the arbcom provisionally suspended the community ban back in N but given later events it looks like that ban was essentially reinstated whether banned or blocked it seems like the community is still allowed to discuss deleting the user page we have deleted user pages of unblocked editors before and nbsp 
 quite what i am saying above is that that would be the aspect i would include in the discussion informing rather restricting the breadth of any review i would welcome the process because then the prot can be lifted 
 on the issue of whether the user is banned or merely blocked see 
 hi this is a friendly notice that i replied to your response at 
 hello again i have emailed otrs and received the ticket number could you please respond at 
 please thank you 
 thank you so much enjoy your barnstar uN a 
 so at minimum the sentence at question clearly overstates the case by implying that employers benefit taxwise from hiring illegal aliens regardless of how they are hired 
 and as for editing the article you are welcome 
 i have attempted searching for pdusgov images on defenselink without success so can this image be considered fairuse or not thanks 
 i have replied at my talk lets carry on there 
 i have also pinged courcelles no major rush but if you get chance to reply thanks 
 thanks i will check it now 
 oh mickey and minnie why do this and betacommand have to come up at the same time someone send me a simple straightforward vandal i can just block sigh an afd takes N days and saving a good article takes a bit of research which takes time betacommand on the other hand has shown that he can take out external links faster than a speeding bullet hes also an admin which is a separate can of worms if you dont know what thats about take a look at 
 good advice as always anonemouse i know i tend to fly off the handle when a group of afds come up and i have been trying hard to hold my tongue in this one i will forge ahead in stoic calm for another day anyway however i dont know about dis i must take exception to that mickey and minnie crack pixie and dixie maybe they are both guys arent they 
 sorry wasnt referring to you just a general mouse expletive 
 salright 
 cute uN 
 sounds like a plan uN 
 all right its monday i looked at a bunch of his nominations he really is nominating stuff worthy of deletion a few so clear but not yet unanimous that even i had to support deletion on them i only wrote keep on one or two i was amused by dekkapais supporting deletion despite the nominator on a couple and one where dek was supporting ebprN defending one of his porn star articles from deletion come on guys he is rough around the edges but clearly means well hes gotten better since the first days i think he will be a valuable wpp member and that frankly is worth a few marginal articles that will never be more than stubs 
 i concur he seems like a decent guy now that its all settled down uN 
 you have undid with edit summary resolve in talk page actually i believe the issue is resolved the user is a new user he has used the undo button and then followed by suggestion to summarize and add his earlier addition the text he has added now needs copyediting and formatting but it is basically what i adviced him to do can you self revert if you have no objection to the edit contentwise 
 fair enough as long as theres someone on top of it as it needs a good copy edit cheers 
 megapixie thanks very much for your efforts adding the pdaustralia template to the images in this article re the small refs though fraid i dont see the usefulness of this change nor does it appear to be a requirement some do it that way some dont my preference is to change it back but thought id discuss it with you first as i appreciate all your other work on the article cheers 
 mate i think you misunderstood me i agree fully with pdaustralia pls check my original comment the only thing i disgreed with was the small references nothing to do with the images cheers 
 hi although your edits are in good intention please do not undo my edits to nicolo giraud i am trying to help undo the damage to wikipedia caused by an editor whose affect was undetected for N years because of the use of very subtle means of eluding the system thanks for your understanding 
 uh no stop destroying a featured article 
 your 
 many thanks 
 thanks if there are any other problems please let me know 
 thank you 
 you may be interested to know that 
 thanks for your support it made it the set of five is complete 
 er my mistake i meant perhaps it would be best to simply rename it shishi as you suggested 
 yes the concept of shishi predates the N s i only came up with shishi because the article was originally specifically regarding the shishi of the restoration and i had only read redirect shishi when i left the message 
 i see that the image from operation pegasus has been deleted by yerself even after i attributed it to captain shores work i know yer response even before it transverses the tiny synapses of yer peasized brain then why didnt you attribute it then it would not have been deleted i love it the logic of wiki editors they will point out your anothers mistakes but will not correct them if they are found at fault it is up to someone else to correct them too i suggest that you go immediately to my users page and comb the other N aclass articles for similar lack of photo attribution you can then delete all of the images that i am sure users of wiki will not need maybe i should delete them myself save you the strenuous effort i already have hard copy of all the articles so what do i need wiki for my publisher is waiting best not keep her too long sayonara 
 the 
 you mean of the historical figures there should be a picture of iemitsu somewherealso do you recall if matsudaira nobutsuna is in this manga if he is i can get a picture of him as well 
 no i dont and if i were to upload scans from the manga it might not be allowed since it would break copyright rules i can contribute historical information and not much else

 evening orderinchaos how do i create a sand box my userpage isnt cutting it anymore 
 go to your userpage and then in the mozilla or ie bar at the top which has the enwikipediaorg url in it just type or sandbox after the end of the name then when that page comes up click the start this page text and voila you are in it you can call it anything really i have got the only requirement is it must start with userwikistarN or 
 i hug you orderinchaos 
 i have responded on your commons talk page and on the image deletion discussion page 
 hi i noticed you changed the 
 as far as uN fN auN eN uN bN goes i think it should link to an article about said posts and how they became ceremonial after a certain point and perhaps a list as well including not only the provincial ones but the nonprovincial ones like nui no kami genba no kami and so on i changed it because well despite the fact that governor of ise is what ise no kami means it wouldnt quite be correct to say that he ruled over or was governor of ise the tuN dduN d hisamatsumatsudaira ishikawa and others ruled over parts of it title in pretense yes but i think that when an average reader reads that they are not going to think that they will first think something like oh what a powerful lord to have controlled not only fukuyama but a whole other province as well itd be like saying that 
 ps isnt this called the ritsuryuN d system or something like that also i dont think that kami and shugo are the same far as i know kami was the imperial governor whereas shugo was the later ashikagaappointed provincial strongman 
 ah yes all excellent points you are right i should have realized that kami is an imperial title while shugo is appointed by the shogunate and that masahiros appointment as ise no kami is separate from the actual rulership of the daimyo of that province alright 
 that being said i think that the article to expand with regards to this issue would be http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or kokushi_ bob t wakabayashi had an excellent article on this point titled in name only which i saw on jstor while i was still in college also perhaps this would be the correct article to link such titles as ise no kami to 
 ah nice thanks for pointing that out i dont know when i will have time to start editing again in earnest but i shall try to keep 
 regards 
 i dont know how the lack of knowledge about the photographer is going to help us to make a free picture of a vehicle that doesnt exist anymore i also dont understand why that picture cant be considered a historical image btw i dont know why you think that using text only is going to be better than using an actual picture pictures and illustrations always help the reader to better understand the subject of the article or a part of it regards 
 ultimately the article will still make sense without the picture come to think of it you can use this logic to any article on wikipedia the only question is would it make the article better also i cropped out the vehicle from the picture as you can see so im not using the entire picture regards 
 hi i went to lordameths talk page to leave a message and just saw your post and compared the article in ja and en and added seemingly the more popular name because the article name is in ja wp unfortunately i do not know much about him but i am willing to help if i can whatever btw what kanji do you use for your name uN feN uN aN uN feN uN fd 
 uN eN uN uN bbf thanks for your prompt response hmmight an initial translation of the japanese wiki article be a good start thats what i did for his enemy 
 regarding the hsN article i have revised the text so that it is not a direct quote of haworth i think though your comment about fair use is off the mark try googling the text i quoted it is already available on the internet and has been made so by a commercial organization thus i hardly feel badly about having quoted it on wikipedia with its original source indicated 
 the link you quoted is interesting but i have to say at the least it is somewhat vague for example one could contend that since people use wikipedia as a reference work that nonprofit educational uses might cover the quote in question but as the article notes nothing is written in stone 
 for me the colours are problematic but they are plausibly useful in ways i havent fully considered yet are you aware that there is a group who focus particularly on a range of issues having to do with succession boxes there appears to be an ongoing discussion about colourcoding across the breadth of articles to be found in enwikipedia i myself have no views on this subject but i am mulling it over in the back of my mind at this point im only offering you a headsup along with the deserved acknowledment of your having taken a tentative step in the right direction 
 hello ooperhoofd and thanks for your comment actually 
 my question becomes relevant in that context will someone please give me one example in which an understandable interest in standardization was not sufficient to overcome the reasons for a specific nonstandard succession box one would hope that there would have been more than one illustrative example 
 i understand your question to be are there examples where the standard succession box is not the best choice there is a longstanding disagreement about which article should be linked to from us representatives boxes (discussion here 
 i hope this somewhat answers your question was there anything specific you were wondering about and ndash
 i must add that i have myself been removing such templates for quite some time and have adopted a specific format for both representatives and senators samples of which one can find in the succession boxes for the united states presidents my versions look essentially the same as the old ones with some redundant text having been removed link modifications can be performed on these newer simplified templates much easier as editing a template is a very different thing indeed from simply editing pages 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the 
 it might be a topic around 
 its a possibility but still leaves the problem that the terms are us army jargon maybe a transwiki to wiktionary would be better 
 addendum looks like someone else has had the same idea 
 anyway im inclined to delete this from the borges article but thought id ask you first in case there is a good explanation im missing 
 its difficult to think of a categorization that would capture the similarities between works analagous to the glass bead game what would appear natural and convey the subtle differences between these and other works N N nov N 
 why you delete this photo 
 seriously didint think so cause he is a and take a lot of pictures the only one that he have in this license is from britney spears really have a lot of copyright license again the only who donxbft have is the britney pic thanks and please answered me on 
 in this instance im persuaded that 
 thanks for apprising me of this discussion ooperhoofd perhaps letting the idea simmer for awhile would be bestafter all as you said you are busy until early N perhaps at that time it will be appropriate to approach the issue with full force and attention 
 i have responded to your comments on the fairtax article im sorry to hear you dont agree with my opinion but it seems that kbsN and looie have provided very reasonable explanations of their proposed changes whereas it seems to be that you appear to be opposing them based upon you having to find new sources if you wish to find another mediator in the cabal or another mediator over at the committee you are welcome to do so once again my apologies but being a little more courteous towards me in future might get you further kind regards uN 
 i dont think its right to call me a moderator of the discussion im simply an outsider as a thirdparty i have no more control over the article than anyone else i appreciate your concerns and im aware that i well and truly fucked up on this one so im probably going to step out of the dispute and allow someone else to take over should you need it thanks for your comments though and i hope we have solved the bad start we seem to have had with our introduction uN 
 you did good 
 at any rate thanks for your question and keep up the good work 
 photo by max smith will be fine thanks for asking good luck 
 i wonder if this way of reconsidering your edit has any resonance 
 anyway yes theres really no doubt about what the artist is trying to convey 
 i have been wondering about kameisama and his relationship to the 
 i believe that the mention of kamei oki no kami korechika on 
 yes i think a lot of text came from mitford i agree the article needs an overhaul and what you said about kamei sounds like what the japanese wp was saying i have always wondered about kamei sama and now i know there was at least a real person with some connection to the ronin its become clearer thanks 
 a few other daimyo connected to this whole chushingura story 
 this is an automated notice by 
 tag added 
 to me this sounds a little like a midN th century version of something vegemitelike 
 ooperhoofd interesting point you bring up therefar as i have heard tofu dregs are what you feed animals as far as sake dregs go i have never quite heard of that before might be vegemiteish though and yes i had vegemite a couple timesnot something id care to repeat again but its a fascinating social concept that says something about aussie taste although your quote above curiously reminds me of the book i read about the 
 i saw your article because i try to keep the victorian dab page under control one thing i forgot to do on that article that i saw before was to fix the headings in a heading only the first word and proper nouns are meant to be capitalized in the interest of learning something {who would know one day id ever teach someone something on wikipedia haha see 
 just another small note when you want to write another comment on a users page related to a cooment you have already written dont use the tab key or go out several spaces as this is code to create a box around the text type a colon before the text and it will be indented if you want to write a third comment two colons fourth comment three colons and so on happy editing 
 i have moved 
 ok i violated but i am a new user who has yet to learn N per cent of the rules by redirecting while i am actually writing an article means that i lose what i have not already saved i was having difficulty with controlling my sandbox so i tried another tactic which apparently broke a rule one day i might be an expert like you 
 i waited N minutes this time before moving 
 sorry i slashed in the wrong direction thanks for the explanation 
 hey peter i made a series of edits this morning and then went to work so no i didnt see the talk page and just got this message i get yatwo people named thomas hazlehurst my suggestion then is to make thomas hazelhurst into a

 thanks i appreciate you posting the relevant passage i also apologize for being a tad overzealous as far as this article is concernedfor my part im going to input all the print citations i can get my hands on in order to get the article to an improved status again sorry about jumping the gun 
 it is actually the river unk as strange as that name may seem 
 firstly lets check that we are talking about the same clun the 
 i have begun a 
 the 
 ooperhoofd thanks for apprising me of this situation i must confess im not that familiar with the genroku earthquake but what you are talking about with regards to naming conventions is a valid point to bring up for discussion this is something i particularly like about your work on wikipedia in that you seem to like to bring things up for discussion and debate and threby get people thinking about the issues at hand i look forward to how this pans out in the coming year 
 please accept this unanticipated token of thanks for that barnsenu award this artwork represents a plausible description of what i like about the wikipedia project and what i like about your recent belowtheradar contributions 
 dear ooperhoofd thank you very much for this gift indeed the whole concept which i like about wikipedia despite all its inherent problems is that it brings people together people of all sorts in progress toward a common goal of spreading and sharing knowledge i am indeed grateful that i have had the opportunity to participate in this endeavor which is i daresay unprecedented in human history and gives some glimpse of how cooperation and teamwork can forge new worlds of understanding i am also grateful to have the opportunity to work with someone like you best wishes for the season and for the coming year 
 please dont put references to these on major pages souch as countries like 
 id go further even as a railway enthusiast i dont agree with adding links to the locomotives from every article that a locomotive is named after this information isnt relevant enough to the article to make sense the fact that a locomotive is named barbados does not mean it should be linked from that 
 thank you for removing these links i have already removed them from australian articles happy editing 
 i agree on this these links make no sense if the

 i know how to make a ref thank you thank you also for giving me breathing room in order to complete said article 
 i thought i was reverting vandalism by restoring that section my mistake as for the name im sure even you will note that the ki of kuki only has one minor difference with the ki of demon hence my assumption im sorry for being incorrect i will leave said article alone from now on thank you 
 no worries i probably didnt log in when i did the changes before yes the name thing is slighthence the confusion its unusual most native readers of the language dont know about it either 
 you may recall that last year i said that i planned to move 
 thanks for letting me know ooperhoofd good to hear that this got resolved without much complexity looking forward to more progress in the days and weeks to come 
 or thanks very much for massive expansion peter 
 great job the manxman is one of my favourite hitchcock films so i was glad to find out more about the author i have two suggestions to make though maybe you could make a brief mention of his mother and of his religion but again well done 
 now wait usertadakuni creates article 
 ha ha ha good one guilty as charged i guess both for that and for 
 reason during the past year my primary focus has had to do with 
 hi peter thanks for your note i moved the four articles you mentioned because i noticed them in 
 hello again peter i found an american contractor today so i set up 
 who knows how this will unfold 
 ooperhoofd as always thanks for apprising me of these sorts of things tenmei would certainly be an interesting name change and considering the words meaning i can see its attraction regardless of your course of action i hope i can keep working with you here best regards 
 im dying to know what this is 
 hahaha me too maybe it will be an article sometime ^_^ N N jun N 
 this seems worth pondering maybe templates could be developed into a useful tool for parsing the sometimes obscure nature of pre
 at any rate thanks again for keeping me posted 
 i dunno thought youd be interested 
 tenmei thanks for letting me know about this new article indeed i am interested in harold bolitho his works have been an inspiration to me as well as an impetus to learn even more on the topic its going to be difficult for me to be N per cent into this right now as im having computer problems but with any luck i will return my full attention to this sometime next week best regards 
 on a related matter i see you have referenced the new historical atlas of cheshire by philips and philips i have been trying to get hold of that for quite some time only having the older one by dorothy sylvester however im happy to see that you used it to name the old domesday hundred runcorn was in there are a few articles on wikipedia that lump in atiscross and exestan with the newer names and im shorly going to start editing them to make clear tN hat the names and the hundreds changed over the years 
 hello again and thanks for the comments i will try to dig out the atlas but the last time i tried to enquire at the records office they had run out but i will give them another go i was in chester last tuesday but as it was mainly to take an eager young son to chester zoo we didnt have much time for anything else however i will think about a special visit and see if i can track a copy down somewhere as i like the place and am rediscovering it after we moved comparatively near from where i have lived in the past after my retirement when i had been absent from cheshire or nearby since N amazon and wwwbookfindercom havent had a copy of the new atlas for as long as i have tried to get it i have tended to reply on my copies of the first two volumes of the victoria history of cheshire and the old sylvester book for maps like that but they can be limited thanks for asking for my first name it is david and i think it was once on my user page but after a series of stalking incidents i have removed most of the personal information on the advice of the wikipedia admins as it allowed someone to access and post personal details of myself and my mother best wishes david 
 thank you so much for fixing the vandalism ill get the rest but thanks for the attempt by the way i know who did it so im going to get them banned 
 you are welcome glad to be of help 
 having said all this do you advise me to deal now with the religion and transport sections along the lines you suggest which might make it unstable for ga assessment or wait for an on hold to deal with it then my interest in all this is as a member of 
 you can leave the sports sections as they are if you think its best 
 i vaguely recall you asked me something about lists dont quite remember anything about context i thought of you when i stumbled across this 
 im not even going to try to think about what it would take to reproduce anything like the 
 my tentative first steps in creating a family tree are probably good enough i tried to think of something not too difficult and the first thing that came to mind was the imperial line which came to an end with 
 i wonder what your first impression will be i wonder if you will be persuaded that this graphic is ready for metastasis or does the gestalt still need a little bit more tweaking 
 tenmei sorry i havent been able to get back to you its been something of a tough week as far as the general layout goes its good but in terms of technicality i think it could use some tweaking especially with regard to the chain of commandall stuff i will go into greater detail soon thanks for letting me know and thanks for taking the initiative in making this first diagram 
 no rush not to worry when you get around to it this is certainly not an urgent matter not really all that important when you think about it just a small step in a constructive direction 
 i will not be watching this page so please leave a or other note on my talk if you reply 
 hmm apparently about half the past year of closings has been off i wonder if that should be fixed it has been a really long time since i have read it so i guess i am really rusty there thanks for noticing that though and keeping me from fudging stuff up more 
 hi tadakuni you placed kagemoto in categorysamurai but the article was already in that category did you mean something different eg categoryhatamoto 
 oops my mistake yes i did indeed mean categoryhatamoto thanks for catching that 
 what about incorporating the term side branch this term is used in reference to ichinoseki in goodmans japan and the dutchgoodman grant kohn what do you think 
 tenmei i think that it might just belong in the clan members section since muneyoshi was born into the date clan and adopted out also i think tamura muneyoshi is more suitable since the tamura of ichinoseki were independent daimyo even though they adopted in and out from the sendaidate over the course of the edo period also i have heard collateral branch or cadet branch frequently used to describe relations like that of the tamura to the main date kind of like say the aizumatsudaira to the tokugawa or the sadowarashimazu to the satsumashimazu 
 oh wait unless im misunderstanding the connotation of adoptedsorry 
 what about incorporating the term side branch this term is used in reference to ichinoseki in goodmans japan and the dutchgoodman grant kohn and goodman may have seen that 
 good point certainly would sound better than collateral which in an age of 
 for me adoption is a difficult term to grasp in the premodern japanese sense of the word 
 just to let you know 
 actually no he wasnt he was an administrator that had loads of sock puppets that he used to swing votes round in his favour he got desysopped and banned as soon as it was found out 
 fascinating i learn something new about wikipedia every day 
 hehthat was the reason why i chuckled peter p in the us i have never heard of runcorn 
 yea his six puppets 
 thanks for the revert 
 yeah that was a particularly bad piece of vandalism especially since shes so young { and #N

 anytime guys sophie you might want to consider removing the link to chzz as they followed the link from your pages sonia i think i might have had it worse my mom was sitting behind my screen and when i scrolled down saw it and rapidly scrolled back i hear what was that i had to explain why i was viewing animated porn on two talk pages at least none of you had it happen twice in one day by a user and his sock

 hi peter i vardy you are off to such a great start on the article 
 thanks for your comments i have had N successful nominations to dyk in fact every nomination i made succeeded this made me suspect that the threshold for success might be rather low its good for the morale to be on the main page but i wonder how many visitors to the site actually bother to scroll down and read the dyk section rather than going for what they really want as regards the 
 thanks for letting me know yes feel free to list me 
 is there anything that im supposed to do i have not been involved in one of these so far as i remember 
 not quite sure myself at first i thought every party should create their own subsection like mine and i even created the headings for you other N then tony sidaway who was an arbcom clerk for a long time took those blank sections away saying everyone should create their own if you have something to say you should probably create your own section but note that for now this is supposed to be the time when the arbcom decides to take or not to take this case so this really should be about that if you have something about betacommand that i havent written please do write it while your block of bc was probably notable i dont think it will make the difference to the arbcom taking or not taking the case so if you just want to defend yourself then you probably want to build your statement in a user subpage or something then put it on the evidence subpage if and when the case is accepted (btw dont be scared because tony thinks your block was spectacularly inappropriate or whatever he wrote though he is an experienced clerk so i will trust his word for the procedural side the impact of his statements on recent arbcom cases have been 
 i have left a reply at 
 thanks for your message peter i was being semiserious about having a uk wikipedia as i think it is getting a bit tiresome dealing with the blinkered and smallworld nature of some of the decisions that are made by force of numbers of usa editors who know little about local conditions in the uk and try to impose some foolish consistency at the expense of distorting sometimes the situation in the uk as described in the articles they say should change to conform with usacentric guidelines of course there are some extremely good and sensible usa editors and i have also benefitted from their input but i do wonder if the extent to which they are drowned out means it is becoming safer to cut and run 
 if you are struggling finding any info particularly about maps and infoboxes always feel free to ask me and i will see if i can help also specific infomation about the uk place infobox is found at 
 just thought id also let you know that i applied 
 regarding i agree the statement was poorly phrased what it seems to be referring to though is a phenomenon i have often watched in disputes where an editor assumes good faith of one party by imputing bad faith to the other if editors want to live by the spirit of 
 i do find it kind of amusing to see you think you can claim to be among the audience after so vociferously claiming affiliation with the people pulling the strings amongst the backstage workings 
 just to be crystal clear where i stand when i approached jimbo wales to the effect of asking him to remove editing priviledges from someone that someone was not a new editor much later arrived than myself but a much more senior editor in far better standing than myself and furthermore in asking jimbo to consider whether that editor should be barred from editing wikipedia i made a specific stipulation that should jimbo feel it useful each and every word i used in the email was his to use as he saw fit attributed to me claimed as his own or whatever none of it i claimed private or priviledged communication this i think very much illustrates a highly divergent perspective from one you seem to have been blessed with i hope you see where i am coming from 
 im afraid thats not very clear at all i never used irc not on any channel i did join a list called cyberstalking because well the name should be obvious i wouldnt wish that on anyone a lot of things have been said about me and attributed to me that i never actually said or did its like looking at a caricature of myself to read it but if im unwelcome i wont bother you again i apologize for the interference 
 well your first posting is amazingly vague there above and now you are referring to irc and to cyberstalking though i have not mentioned either what are you really trying to say i wont enter into shadow boxing matches but i will not in anyway let anyone think that your and my situation are comparable i may have decided to have not pressed issues where more forceful people might have done so that does not make me somebody who has decided to be an onlooker rather than an actor so i think really trying to fish for sympathy from these quarters is not something you are well advised to pursue that much i can say without hesitation

 i notice you have added a default sort key to many uk church articles this seems to be to improve the ordering in 
 thanks for the message i was of course trying to make sense of the national sorting which did not make sense im not sure how to limit the sorting to just one category can you advise please 
 instead of adding a default sort key you add the sort key to the individual categories like this 
 i plan on continuing to work primarily on okinawan topics for a while i also have some material on the kantobased toshima clan and their 
 interesting stuff you have mentioned by the wayid like to keep helping in little ways on the okinawan stuff however i can also im glad you have got a book about tsushimahan i feel like thats another domain that no one pays attention to by the way a random question who ruled the oki islands i read that it was matsue but was that always the case

 hi peter i vardy you are off to such a great start on the article 
 your thoughts on the matter and suggestions would be most appreciated uN uN duN uN fuN 
 lordameth thanks for all the help lately i really appreciate it as far as what you are saying here goesi like the idea of a table because its so systematic but i must say that if you could turn it into prose that may be better thing is though if you go beyond just stating the xxxx mission composed of yy envoys led by prince soandso was sent in gratitude or congratulation for the investiture or succession of king or shogun soandso and actually go into just a little bit of detail about something anything that sets that mission apart then youd solve the problem of it looking overly formulated just add a little bit of extra detail so that it sets each mission apart from the other i mean for example if i were to come into possession of a record of all the times that 
 hi peter the current article is somewhat under the guideline minimum words and so is unlikely to run can you expand it i have added an image from 
 thanks for the very good image i have expanded the article and hope this is sufficient to qualify for dyk 
 excellent thanks i wonder if its worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page as N xN is really very small 
 sorry i dont know how to do that can you help thanks for your support 
 i have cropped and brightened a touch and uploaded to imagemarton church cropjpg use whichever you prefer in the article but i think the cropped version works better at N xN cheers 
 thats great many thanks 
 maybe you can help me out with this terminology question im working on a list of those entombed at 
 lordameth sorry i havent gotten back to you yet on this one my guess is that the others might be either a second wife or queen or a secondary queen if that makes any sense the only thing i can compare it to in my head is the idea of a daimyos or nobles wife the main or legal wife is seishitsu uN bN uN baN and concubines are sokushitsu uN uN baN sorry i cant be of any more help than thisi will give it some more thought or poke around a bit more though and let you know if i find anything cheers 
 once again keep up the good work cheers 
 done although i will be honest i just added the three most used sites by myself when i want to look up any information about the league instead of veryfying the wikipedia content with those three sites i do not use them to update the goal scorer list because if you investigate those closely then different sites will always give different results so how do i know it is right well i have a huge excel sheet in which i add each and every goal scorer in each match played once you have the list its no so much work to update it every week i even have more trouble with keeping the length of the columns the same 
 okay thanks by the way it doesnt matter how its done as long as the sources are good to go 
 or 
 thanks yes i had seen it the standard at dyk seems to be going up at the moment its hard to get anything under N characters in i had a poke around at the medieval church paintings website and it looks like a useful source and i have found thornber a reliable resource on my local church 
 ah you beat me to this one i live not far away so might well be able to provide photos if theres anything on the interior thats of interest 
 the church website says the coat of arms is currently being restored which might be a pain for photos at the moment 
 you have been sending a lot of articles to 
 jedijbp first of all if someone blanks your userpage as you did mine you too can revert it simply go into history and click undo on the most recent edit anyone whether registered or ip editor can do that secondly what you did is blanking what i did is nominating for deletion there is a difference thirdly if you were looking to type things up perhaps you could have used something (like 
 i have set up a 
 i have suggested 
 if you could inform me of that id be much obliged 
 i do use it can you let me know about the barnstars too please cheers 
 while im not really a fan of rendering daimyo as an english word i do know that 
 i agree with lordameth however for the sake of consistency im gonna go with what you said fgN thanks for writing 
 thanks to both lordameth and tadakuni 
 so glad you raised this issue with vox humana N see my comments in march at 
 i am maybe misinformed all i know is that an admin once told me that the format i use is correct i am happy to be informed otherwise given that from what i have seen the church of format seems to mess up categorising
 i agree that an admin once told me does not reflect proper consensus however as i have not seen such a consensus on this titling issue i have had to work by what i know having seen how the church of format messes up titling i would use it only where the dedication of the church makes the st saints church place impractical additionally if the church is dedicated to st mary magdalene the church of format should i think be used but i think that where the dedication is to st mary the virgin st marys church place would suffice however many catholic churches pose a problem holy paraclete church placeor our lady of lourdes church place sound rather clunky again i would say that the church of format should be used on such nonstandard dedications what say you 
 oh by the way try to avoid article possession syndrome in effect when you press that save page button you give your contributions to the whole wikipedia community you dont own any articles and neither do i 
 vox and peter thank you both for all this yes i too am much more comfortable with a general style of uN st saintuN s church townuN for the article title and i will embrace that approach (subject only as you say to us being alert to those more unusual dedications where local use has determined that the uN church of st uN uN style is the more elegant title eg 
 ok thanks i hadnt requested it as i use twinkle for most antivandal stuff but i appreciate the vote of confidence thanks 
 you are welcome 
 please consider the format edits at 
 tenmei good idea thanks for your improvement 
 thats decent of you id love to replace it but that file is currently on that list maybe i could when the vote has finished 
 a projectwide consensus would be useful as consistency seems the most important thing here do you feel up to raising the general question at the talk page of the naming conventions article 
 hope you have a good holiday im sure this can wait until your return st vs st is potentially a trickier question as several guides to uk english usage favour no point where the abbreviation ends in the final letter of the unabbreviated word while as far as im aware us usage would always use a point for any abbreviation consistency on uk churches should be attainable however and redirects are a cheap fix 
 thanks as always for this firstrate contribution to wikipedia 
 fgN many thanks for participating in the peer review of 
 as to the cheshire portal its certainly in a sufficiently good state now to highlight there i will suggest it formally in a minute by the way what do you think of my 
 i wouldnt worry over much about the image copyright issue its no more problematic than N per cent of similar images and at worst a fairuse rationale could be supplied 
 hi dave i have added a version of the criticism section you wrote to 
 dave go ahead and edit as you see fit i see the subpage discussion as more or less closed now as most of the issues aa raised are dealt with the thing to watch is to be scrupulous about using good sources and sticking closely to what they say when dealing with 
 hey dave look out for the scott articles i sent you three altogether 
 thanks thats excellent lots of bedtime reading 
 a query of my own do you think theres any point in trying 
 thanks for the encouragement i will try and pluck up my courage for my firstever attempt at the ga process and also for pointing out the broken link the sale notices are sad the place used to be the best restaurant within N miles of here and ever since that closed the place has been on the market more often than not i keep hoping that the national trust or similar will buy it and open it to the public as everyone seems agreed its a very significant building but they never seem to show any interest 
 courage has been thoroughly plucked up picking up off floor might be needed in a few weeks i dont quite know why i have never tried before to a certain extent i still feel that N informativebutbrief articles are better than N ga and a lot of my early article work was on immense topics that would need a N person collaboration to get the article anywhere near comprehensive as to the novel it progresses in fits and starts and i tend to edit wp when its going badly cheers 
 i note you have gone for it too lets hope in a few weeks we have two more gas for the cheshire project 
 heres the first test fgN what do you think my only real issue is that i cant seem to get it to display a caption in the same box as the image in the way that the family name template does 
 incidentally in looking at the japanese article on 
 fgN looking forward to your contributions to 
 i would draw your attention to the thread at 
 i removed some of the tags but im not positive hes notable enough to survive an afd i think you have done fine work on the article though and i certainly wont be nominating it for deletion 
 i need to concentrate here i thought you were mr poor hang on you are i give up when i get ed poor and uncle ed and uncle g mixed up it really is time to go home 
 introspection is good you are a fine writer 
 oh ok thanks you too 
 i have suggested a new shorter and punchier hook if you could look it over that would be great cheers 
 i have added it though i have had to lengthen it again slightly to include the pictured we shall see if it stays up there i dont think much of the quality of the current batch of suggestions but there are huge numbers of them so someone might well think leycesters too esoteric to feature 
 hi eequor i noticed you have done a cleanup of the categorization of carcinogens and made categories for each of the iarc groups i have no problems with this particularly as i dont want to get involved in the perennial categories vs lists debate i am on the look out for comments and suggestions for the coverage of carcinogens in wikipedia articles and so i wondered if you had any at present i encourage the use of the iarc classification as it is international and because the assesments are published the ntp and eu classifications are also used in articles 
 at the moment that doesnt add information however if we could tweak the templates to deliver html popup boxes that would be a real improvement especially for the shorter articles 
 oh and mdash thats what they are meant to do actually they should each produce a popup message if the mouse is held over them N N august N 
 so they do i was just too impatient to notice thanks i will try and sort out the rest of the bunch 
 regarding the carcinogens i was wondering how iarc group N ought to be categorized is this group notable enough to be classed under the real carcinogens and are there chemicals in the group that should be treated as potential carcinogens N N august N 
 im glad you like the longer version in 
 or 
 oh dont mention it dr vardy im glad you approve of the hook thank you for the nice little article 
 heh cheshire churches should feature on the main page every day 
 hi tadakuni firstly congratulations on your adminship im certain you deserve it i am seeking some advice i am currently up at rfa and 
 my apologies for the delay to be honest with you i think what helped me win in the end was that i have an established strong history of good substantial editing i also have a history of erring on the side of caution and asking for help when i need it i could have very easily failed but the bureaucrat who reviewed my case decided that the benefits outweighed the risks i suppose at any rate id say just try even now to start getting into project space stuff i took my rfa as an opportunity to do the same best regards 
 or 
 well done 
 my advice is not to sweat the conflict of interest business too much yes its an issue but focusing on it will just lead you into a personal conflict with that user and wont help the article instead focus on making the article broader expanding it rather than contracting it then after you have covered agile cmmi thoroughly it should be clear just how big a player dalton and broadsword are and how much space to give them in the article if you want someone else to advise you or help take a look at the contributions history of the 
 thanks roger wilco

 nice edits on hinduism the columns look great 
 thank you 
 hi i have nominated 
 hello peter im having problems with some of the information on the st marys church page from the its most unlikely that the site of this church has been a place of worship since the N th century because it was originally just a chapel of another church the yew tree isnt mentioned in domesday book and there are more kempe windows at hucknall church in nottinghamshire it would also be well worth checking the civil war sabre story from the same source 
 thanks for nominating the article i started about 
 thank you for the note dr vardy that was a little disappointing but its okay i look forward to seeing more articles from you on uk historic sites at dyk happy editing 
 i have added a book source ref for the domesday priest in a spirit of extreme cheekiness i have also added the old chester city arms to 
 ok i inserted the word national that should be an end to it 
 i am sorry that i cannot give you a more definitive answer but i wish you luck in expanding your article on this interesting historical figure 
 regarding 
 im not going to decline the unblock request because im certain there would be wikilawyering about involved admin but i will comment that you are misunderstanding the reason for the block its not about one incident its the latest incident in a long series of disruptive incidents to my own personal knowledge the disruption started more than a year ago see 
 i know its not about one incident and and i understand that this block is based on my own actions im just saying that now that i think about it 
 it has taken you N days to acknowledge consensus regarding your block by stating things like now that i think about it and by your strikeouts above upon further consideration i dont think more discussion at this point is necessary you have been advised to come back in more than a few months more discussion now is only likely to lengthen the time until any unblock request would be considered because the 
 that does not explain how your rfa oppose concerns have anything to do with this issue that only explains your position on whether i acknowledge consensus of my block uN 
 your belief that there is no connection between the two is central to the problem in rereading that oppose i see little difference in your activities between then and now there are two wikilinks to you not getting it regarding closing your rfa back then same as not getting it here about your block i made specific mention of your tendentious interactions with a single editor that didnt stop until a series of rfcs were opened and modified repeatedly you are now doing the same thing trying to modify a block i also mentioned that you dont display the temperament expected of an admin in watching your talk page and your frequent appearances at ani since then as well as my own interactions with you i have question that your temperament is suitable at all for contributing to a project in which the opinions of others must be considered technical ability is one thing doing things that concur with what a group believes is appropriate is quite another despite a large amount of 
 doing things that concur with what a group believes is appropriate is quite another id like to know what that means or did you mean dont concur with what a group believes is appropriate is quite another uN 
 the whole sentence technical ability is one thing doing things that concur with what a group believes is appropriate is quite another you display the technical ability you do not display the ability to do things that concur with what the community believes 
 but doesnt reporting and enforcing policy violations concur with what the community believes uN 
 the fact that you have been banned and are currently blocked should suggest to you that perhaps your understanding of what the community believes is imperfect at best there are as ever avenues for you to appeal your block that dont require any intermediary my suggestion to you is that wait for a few months maybe experiment and learn in another online community and then lodge an appeal with the arbitration committee 
 the only way to appeal to arbcom is through the ban appeals subcommittee but at this point or any future point i would be in no position to contact the subcommittee uN

 thank you for not acting like its the end of the world if wikipedia decides to go with something that actually sorts itself and where its harder to categorize someone without his or her knowledge (i have had at least one person tell me that he or she had no idea that he or shed been listed on wikipedians or x 
 i know that you have had some bad experiences with runcorn at fa in the past but do you think that you might be prepared to consider 
 copyediting is one of the skills offered by this group so being a guinea pig in trying this idea out may produce results quicker than waiting for the loce which seems to be permanently overloaded with requests 
 you know why { and #N 
 haha thanks at least you arent a sock of someone this time around so it is honest 
 whoops nevermind wrong barnstar there 
 its a personal preference of mine though to slightly reduce the text size in tables they always look a bit in your face to me otherwise nice article well done 
 thanks for that i intend to make brasseys list into tables in due course im a bit new to tables and am very ignorant about them i agree that the text size is in your face how do i fix it now 
 i changed the first table so that you can see how its done i will try and have a good look at john douglas in the next day or so 
 dunnit applied the same to the douglas tables which also look much better are the images ok or should we find a better way of displaying them 
 i think the images do need some work yes but it depends on what you are trying to achieve are the images supposed to be in a single ribbon down the right hand side or in separate ribbons related to the tables on the separate subject of the tables i notice that they dont all match in terms of their column widths 
 early stages as you realise and a bit experimental my first idea was to put the images if and when i found them opposite the relevant table ie separate ribbons that may or may not work i will also look at the column widths in due course i just wanted a comment on whether things were progressing in a reasonable direction i think in time there will be so much douglas stuff that it will merit a separate list thanks for the comments to date 
 my motivation for getting involved in wikipedia was to make local history easily available to everyone im no historian or geographer but i felt that if people could connect more easily with their past and the history of the place they were living in then they might respect it more sorry i almost started to unburden myself on you there 
 im bringing this up again as you seemed unpleased with this last time i added a tag four months have passed and theres still no more references i have put up a tag in the hopes that it will find some take care 
 sure 
 for example im puzzled why you removed the pubchemncbinlmnihgov link from 
 or congratulations and the coveted top pictured slot too 
 congratulations great to see cheshire hitting the main page again cheers 
 the pubchem link is now available near the top of the drugbox 
 thanks i didnt notice that looking at the diffs alone that whys i urge you to start using edit summaries it makes life a hell of a lot easier for the 
 in the stub note you just wrote there appears on my screen a purple word that looks sort of like st^b i suppose this is supposed to be ipa for stub but why here 
 yes apparently 
 hi i was wondering if you could take a look at the buckton castle article and tell me what you think id like it to be ga standard its a short article but theres only so much that can said about it and i think this is nearly it im coming to you because you got the 
 hello just back from a N day holiday in london exhilarating and exhausting i have a lot of nonwiki catching up to do but will certainly try to have a look in the next few days cheers peter 
 i have placed some comments on the articles talk page which i hope are helpful as a matter of personal interest where are the other two ringworks in the historical counties of lancashire and cheshire good luck 
 thanks for the help i have not be able to completely address all the points you raised for example a current state section would be woefully small as there really isnt much to say but what you suggested has improved the article especially the recommendation about the plan by ormerod i will put it up at 
 i agree that the article is better now good luck with gac lets hope its a reasonable assessor 
 your updates are still very unproductive you are updating N month with N article change at a time is there a point to this this is not helping the wikify project we like to be able to track our progress each dayseeing an update every minute isnt helping that would you please drop your edits down to one edit per day to update all the months at the same time thanks 
 not while i still have to move articles that were tagged during october out of september 
 we dont need to know that you dont need to update to let us know that you moved one article from september to october what we do need to know at the end of the day is that we have N less in one category and N less overall those are things that matter to us not i did one article 
 i had looked forward to seeing the depressingly huge september category become smaller on a consistent basis finally and was most displeased to see it growing by leaps and bounds i couldnt see who was doing and didnt know who to yell at to make it stop i finally found who was doing most of it and am now going through his or her user contributions page to correct that i love seeing september get smaller even if its only one article at a time the articles have a greater chance of being noticed in a smaller category anyway 
 thats great that you love to see them get smallerwe all dobut we dont care if one article gets done at N and then another article gets done at N what we care about is how much progress did we make in the last N hours if you feel want to track it on your own id suggest creating your own subpage something like 
 just to be clear the otherwise its depressing edits apply only to those edits that were improperly dated actually it was more like really really annoying right now im correcting something that was really really areally annoying to watch go on im just trying to shrink september down to its true size this is really just people watching 
 cheers 
 please merge and edit the two articles as you see fit the source i cited andrews discusses two main causes of anticoagulantinduced skin necrosis those being warfarin and heparin induced thanks again for your help 
 hi peter the reason i hadnt tagged this one is because i have hardly begun to work on it i have a huge amount of information that i hope to add as soon as i can get my head around it aiming for a dyk as my 
 ps might i suggest that you link directly to the database subpage rather than the index page for quicker reference 
 i agree about the links but when i clicked on the links on the index page the address did not change so i was not sure how to get the direct link to the page can you advise i ask because i have made similar links on some other cheshire pages and i should like to correct them best wishes peter 
 discovered how to do it 
 i was surprised to find such a wellknown house as 
 is it necessary for you to remove a wikification tag then report it on the template this being N minutes after you updated it to let us all know that in the last hour we gained N in october and lost N in september what is your rationale behind that 
 i dont know i just wanted to 
 or 
 congratulations the portal is certainly not going to be short of dyks next update you seem to have a knack of getting the pictured slot which keeps on eluding me 
 thanks actually a lot of getting the pictured slot stems from your advice to me to go to 
 i think the main page dyk generates more traffic in the N uN hours than the portal does in a month so its definitely worth slogging away at them just featuring on the suggestions page gets a few seasoned editors looking the page over as well which often results in useful edits 
 as an aside i have been wondering about suggesting that the portal ditches doing a monthly featured biography as we are currently very limited in highquality articles with a free picture that have a strong link to cheshire in favour of doing featured place featured article and featured picture the article slot could of course include biographies if good ones turn up i believe one of the geography portals that is featured or at featured review uses this structure though i cant find the one i was looking at now what do you think 
 regarding what to put on the portal lets use what seems appropriate if there are not enough biographies lets use what is available 
 oh and 
 now 
 by the way 
 thanks for the news i had assumed that as it had become expired that was the end of it so successful after all thanks for your input the more we have of cheshire dyks the better 
 a whole set often get expired just because theres a backlog as there is today they remain viable until they are removed from the page totally its not unheard of for items as much as N days expired to be selected 
 in fact i note the headings just been chanaged from expired to expiring to reflect this 
 i see you are from pittsburgh too great that pittsburgh has a growing improv scene i miss it sometimes seems like a lot is happening there nowadays 
 our differences are very very minor your edits were very good 
 or 
 so it made it after all it must have appeared overnight i missed it 
 or 
 and to you i think this month might already be a record for the cheshire wp 
 the movies were 
 i see thanks i am going to look for them since i always find it interesting to see how popular culture portray wikipedia 
 or 
 you are right it is shropshire i tend to forget that we live so near to the border 
 i think that theres lots to like about this article and the interior photos are simply great its obviously not a million miles away from a credible ga nomination but if i was the reviewer id be critical of two things first of all id say that there were too many short sentences yes i know what you are going to say but bear with me secondly id say that the short sentences result in there being no real flow in some of the prose making it read a little bit disjointedly this then this then this 
 thanks for that i will have a go i suspect i am stronger on content than on style cheers 
 i have got a suggestion to make as well i found the cathedral section a bit difficult to follow without having any idea of the layout of the cathedral would it be possible to include a floor plan of the cathedral 
 it shows the value of a pair of outside eyes although what i said about the organ is what the source says in fact the choir organ is a division of the main organ text amended accordingly your idea of a plan is excellent but i have a problem with including one i do not have the expertise to produce one myself and to copy one may run into copyright difficulties the best plan i have found is at but i am pretty sure this is under copyright and i have no clue how to satisfy the obligation of a fair use rationale the one at i think demands a fee there are older probably out of copyright but much less clear plans such as and and perhaps the best oldie at what do you think thanks for the contributions made so far oh and i should like to use the image of the exquisite choir canopy and a misericord on 
 the chester tourist plan looks perfect my understanding is that we draw an image ourselves based on that one then there are no copyright problems i will have a go at producing one if you like 
 thanks that would be ideal hope it does not take too much valuable time peter 
 i have made a start on the plan and i will hopefully be able to upload something tomorrow but monday at the latest 
 no rush i meant to say too much of your valuable time 
 well i have finished it and added it to the article if you see any errors let me know i wasnt sure whether to draw it in the same eastwest orientation as the graphic on the cathedrals web site or northsouth as in most of the older maps but i settled on eastwest in the end it would be very easy to rotate the graphic N degrees to produce a northsouth orientation though if theres some convention to do so 
 it looks like you have this situation under control when you get done killing off all the copyvio bits feel free to just remove the listing from the copyright problems page i will check it when you do to make sure everything looks kosher and all should be well 
 so what exactly are the remaining problems 
 none that i know of if all the sentences quadell picked out are fixed to your satisfaction i just wasnt sure youd rephrased all of those yet 
 do they look rephrased to you im not always good at this sort of thing and im surprised that i can do it at all right now (witness what happened with 
 done 
 i have already done some cleanup here is 
 buh wont google see this page anyway i do not understand 
 thats excellent many thanks i prefer the orientation the way you have done it i visited the cathedral this morning and have a bit more information which i will add when time allows i was wondering about replacing the image of the choir ceiling with that of the choirstalls and misericord these are well worth demonstrating what do you think 
 swapping the images sounds good to me 
 i find it easier to do copyediting in bursts coming back with a fresh eye from time to time so i may make a few more suggestions but id say that this article is definitely worth a punt a ga now you have done a great job with it 
 done a bit more polishing and submitted it as a gac 
 its been recreated as you can see and there were no categories until i tagged it nor were any references nor claims to the effect that they really deserve an article here and they dont use hangon they just remove the tags including the wikification tag 
 another admin has since redeleted it and i ahve now protected it from recreation so hopefully this will be the end of it 
 thank you 
 i think your plan is pretty good malleus so im sorry to suggest this as i know you spent quite some time on it but confers better information regarding the various phases of the build and the inclusion of the vaulting lines is really useful for architectural nerds such as myself you actually picked me to the post regarding the plan although the plan i just linked to is actually in the public domain my view is it needs a fairly extensive overdraw to make it sufficiently legible colour etc the other issue with your plan malleus is that it might be better to exclude the text in english and just use numbers that way we can still link the text in the image caption but the plan can easily be transwikid to other languages kind regards 
 if you or peter want to replace my plan with something else thats fine with me im not wedded to it if we are going to stick with my version then i will be quite happy to remove the text if theres general agreement to do that 
 i will have a stab at another and we can make our minds up then ps seems the rev 
 i have copied this discussion on to 
 i did blank the copyright violations you blanked the whole article much of which was not a copyright violation please restore the noncopyright violations 
 done 
 well done thanks 
 you are welcome 
 you removed a great deal of text from 
 yes it was painfully obvious copyvio from 
 fair enough just consider providing an edit sum for such drastic changes uN 
 okay 
 thanks peter i think it was pfhlai who reordered the pictures so that they didnt make sense i hadnt realised 
 thanks peter two in one update is my record i think 
 re your speedy request for 
 maybe you could stick on 
 hi i didnt remove the en dashes i just substituted the visual of them rather than using their html code they are still different or larger from the normal dashes they are just a bit neater in the source code for the article if you look below the edit summary box while editing the page theres a line that starts with insert the first dash after that is the endash and the second is the emdash click on them to insert them in the edit box wherever your cursor is btw you will be seeing more from me on the article in the future as i add info from the home book to it 
 congratulations it sailed through ga 
 hi thanks for reviewing the featured picture nomination that i submitted i never nominated a picture before could you please tell me whether the original nasa picture has enough pixels and if so can it be uploaded to wikipedia or wikimedia without losing the pixels the original nasa picture is thanks 
 just thought id mention that someone at nasa has kindly responded regarding the arctic shrinkage pic see maybe you could respond to him thanks and happy new year 
 get on skype { and #N 
 i had to go to sleep as i have work during the week i ended up going home sick today though so thats why im not there right now besides im always on skype now so i am dead when i am not 
 it seems strange that you have decided to target this article for deletion other football club articles relate to by far less noteworthy australian rules football teams eg 
 its called articles concerning unnotable tend to stay unwikified i swear there are people who think that getting a wikipedia page will make them famous and everyone who comes to wikipedia is going to see it just because they put it there and thats just not true if you are notable then no hardly anyone is going to see your page without hitting random article or joining the 
 i have written a stub on him now hopefully enough to keep the deletion police away from it anyway but it still astonishes me that wikipedia has an article for every single episode of the simpsons yet hardly anything on these N thcentury engineering megastars ah well 
 my parallel moan is about N th century architects in writing articles on cheshire churches and grade i listed buildings few of the important architects had articles about them i have tried to remedy this a bit with new articles on 
 i think chester castle looks good well worth a shot at ga 
 hi i noticed you tagged 
 i only tagged it because some moron had inserted 
 thanks i remove them 
 you are welcome 
 by the way i was wondering about going for it with 
 i agree that chester castle is a bit thin on the history section but i have added all the info i can find in my sources if you add more i would be delighted re crewe hall i think that is excellent and should easily get a ga rating the assessors usually come up with a few quibbles (although amazingly they did not with 
 re 
 they are not meant to be used in the body of an article 
 ah as i recall it was you who confused me on that one by adding them to 
 oh dear i did didnt i probably ought to go back and fix that 
 i just knew they were too pretty to conform to mos 
 not really i just go by where the person was born and whether or not s or h or it was categorized under printmakers 
 i noticed youd flagged this as a copyvio since its an exact copy it can actually be speedied with dbcopyvio i have added the speedy tag as well thanks 
 i know but i love the dramatic flair of a page blank 
 hi when i reluctantly filed a report on carolaN s sockpuppets a previous report by you came up just doing you the courtesy of telling you cheers 
 hi thanks for support on this can you tell me is it appropriate to warn lyle on his various user pages of the investigation i havent done this before and dont really know protocol 
 i have no problems with the concept of removing articles or reverting articles that are proven cases of violating copyright however i noticed that you are tagging articles as screaming copyvio and blanking them do you have a criteria which makes you decide what articles are copyvios 
 i dont know that i have blanked them reverted them to much shorter versions yes but i didnt blank them when i see large chunks of unwikified text added to a stub i get suspicious 
 i would get suspicious too but i am afraid of accusing some one of copyvio without proof and yes you do revert and do not blank i am also afraid that the person who added the unwikified text just may not know how to wikiy text or they may be adding text from a noncopyrighted source or it may be something they themselves wrote for some other publication and hold a copyright too 
 hi ive just seen the churches in cheshire navbox you have created thankyou it is really usefull when reading the church related articles (i started to create one but made some errors
 thanks for the message i did not create the navbox and mdash i just added to the box you had created its made it rather large and i am not sure how we should proceed from here i have therefore raised a query on the cheshire project talk page 
 in respect of your question about ownership i have placed a query on the talk page of wikiproject cheshire 
 hi i just saw that you have removed almost two months of editing work from 
 on second thought you were right much more seemed to have been lost than gained since oct N please disregard thats still one unruly list in artistic depictions and would benefit from subsections based on genre but i will try to get to that later if you like please reapply the list clean up tag as i dont believe it did correctly last time 
 hi again i have taken a crack at structuring and subcategorizing that 
 looks fine to me all edit tags in correct place i see the ones on the derbyshire page have now crept up halfway 
 on the cheshire page the edit links are in the right places but the map at the top is interacting with the photo of aldington i see its spreading now list of places in leicestershire has problems 
 oh well i suppose by the time she gets to cornwall someone more mardy than us will tell her to knock it off 
 would you accept a nomination for adminship i have noticed your work identifying copyvios for some time now and i can see you have also been wading in to the backlog on the wikification categories i think youd be a great administrator and if you are ok with it i would like to nominate you 
 depends what else does an admin have to do 
 you are not required to do anything actually if you really want to you can ignore the tools completely there are certain tasks that the tools are very useful for though and you are already very involved in one such task identifying copyvios blatant copyvios of the sort you come across while going through unwikified articles can be speedied and it would save time and effort for you and others if you had the tools to do it yourself as you came across them beyond that i suspect your experience would be fairly similar to mine i have used the delete button thousands of times mostly for dealing with copyvios or fair use problems but have used the other two buttons only a dozen or so times in my three months as an admin what we really need in administrators is people who have shown that they are willing to work hard on the thankless task of reducing backlogs the work you have done with wikification demonstrates that you are willing to do that and the delete button will certainly be helpful to you in that work that alone is a good reason to make you an admin in my opinion but another advantage is that with the delete button you could help out when you have time on the 
 that is starting to sound like a plan how do i run oh and is it legal to delete articles that havent been speedytagged as long as they are blatant copyvio i would love to do that instead of worrying that the dummy who put it up is going to revert it like an overly emotional moron 
 if you decide to run i will prepare a nomination page for you there are questions on the standard nomination form for the nominee to answer which you would fill out administrators are indeed able to delete blatant copyvios without a waiting period as per 
 with 
 excellent i have nominated you 
 i removed the leicestershire images and left comment on the talk page 
 a final note i had a look at grade N listed buildings in cheshire and noticed that the illustrations showed a lot of listing buildings listing backwards due to the photographer being forced to point the camera upwards this is quite easy to fix in an image editor but unfortunately the palaver of downloading uploading etc once the image is in wikipedia is a bit tedious i did it for 
 thanks id welcome instructions although when i have time to get round to it is another matter it would be helpful to have the info available cheers 
 can you please remove the fame and defame section of your userpage it is unnecessary for wikipedia and seems to violate 
 i wasnt referring to wikipedian users how can you fame a wikipedian i just feel that it is unneccessary to include the maplestory information on a userpage 
 again please refrain from adding episode navigation boxes to articles one can easily see the previous and following episode by looking at the infobox the navigation boxes make the article look messy plus there was prior consensus against this and little input was received on 
 if they shouldnt be there then maybe the boxes for all the other episodes might as well be deleted too 
 just a suggestion it has images but no edit problems 
 i have copied the parishes page at 
 it is my regretful task to inform you that i have closed your request for adminship early as unlikely to achieve consensus please do not be discouraged a number of users have had their first rfa end without consensus but have been promoted overwhelmingly in a later request please continue to make outstanding contributions to wikipedia and consider requesting adminship again in the future you may find 
 well that didnt work out like id hoped its a shame we could really use your help as an admin if you are interested in the job over the longer term it shouldnt be too hard to follow the suggestions people made on the rfa and pass with no trouble in a few months if not of course what you have been doing all along has been working out great and its possible to do plenty of great work with out the tools anyway thanks for giving it a shot and sorry it didnt work out cheers 
 funny story im not sure that i felt as angry as i looked in those afds the deblunting effects of 
 tough questions the only answer i have is that we have thousands of onetime or passerby contributors and not enough examples of what we really want an article to look like the only thing for it is to keep setting a good example and hope that quality improves over time we will always have to work at teaching people how to contribute and some will learn more quickly than others as for the comments on rfa it is a pretty weird process but dont worry about it 
 thanks 
 i notice you have done a lot of tweaking whats the plan do you think that it is ga material 
 the article achieved ga status in april N since which there has been a lot of editing this has left some loose ends which might lead to problems when ga status is reviewed i am trying to tidy up do you have a problem with that if i make any mistakes i am sure you or another editor will deal with them 
 hi peter i note that you do not appear to have admin rights which seems somewhat suprising given your tenure and experience are you not interested in the extra tools at all 
 thats very kind of you i am honoured but being retired now and enjoying the quiet life i am very happy to write articles and do a bit of editing and dont want the hassle that some admins seem to suffer but you have cheered me up no end cheers and best wishes to you 
 its not all hassle if you just use the tool set for your own ends theres no real grief after all the tools dont rust and theres plenty to hand out but if you are not that interested then thats fine as well it trully is no big deal however i do believe long established editors like yourself may find a need for them and should really just get them if you have a rethink please hit me up for a nomination at 
 thanks i will bear it in mind but at the moment im happy 
 no worries happy editing 
 i have added the template to the article 
 um where did you get the idea it was mine the only reason i didnt prod it myself was because i didnt have the balls to do it 
 i try to inform all seriously involved parties according to the changelog and i have no time to figure out who contributed what so if you agree you may either back me with 
 peter if you dont want the tools just accept them and then give them to me i promise you id take very good care of them 
 nice thought i know you would peter 
 peter > piers > pierre > pedro such a common name 
 if its any help peter i was dropping by to ask you this same question i very much hope you let us know if you decide that youd like the extra buttons happy editing 
 thats extremely kind of you but im very happy to be a simple editor and i really dont want the excitement that some admins have seemed to generate im retired im enjoying life why should i want more still your comments are much appreciated really 
 whoa slow down with your stubbing there is no way 
 then revert it 
 i just did and about twenty others you have mislabelled i shouldnt have to go back through them all and doublecheck your mislabelling if you cant be bothered actually looking at the articles find something else to do 
 would these be banksia articles by any chance i dont remember stubbing that many 
 no 
 hi dr vardy i have added the inline citations for 
 good to hear from you again thanks for the citations you have added to vale royal abbey you dont need one for every sentence if the same reference does for successive sentences i suggest you just use the last one if you see what i mean i have only had time for a glance at netley abbey and it looks very promising at the moment i am between a holiday away and a week of grandparent duties so i will have a more detailed look after that first impressions are as follows you need a longer lead probably three paras for an article of this length the lead should be a summary of the whole article enough for someone who comes across it to get a good idea of the contents and then to read more if they want for the references i suggest you use rather than it seems to be the preferred option and looks better also if you are using a book for a number of references it is a good idea to put the book into a bibliography section and in the notes section just put the page numbers (see 
 hi doctor vardy thanks for taking a look at 
 hey i readded the current event tag to 
 well you should know that all of that violates 
 wow you are really going to start an edit war over a silly template ok well i wont revert your reversion and perpetuate this childish behavior but if you would have taken N seconds to take a look at the news youd see its quite clear that this article describes a situation that is a current event the page is about to get changed a lot and there is likely to be a lot of vandalism and povpushing added to it if you are worried about 
 wow you are really going to attempt to provoke a user over a silly template ok well i wont insult you and perpetuate this childish behaviour but if you took N seconds to take a look at 
 i dont know if you are aware of 
 no i wasnt aware of this very useful source i have added the online link to my bookmarks and will use it for future edits to church articles thanks for drawing my attention to it and to your useful edits to 
 could you please check this article again i am positive it has met all of your objections 
 yes you have the fixittags are gone 
 hi there i reviewed the article it is generally in good shape and i found only minor concerns these are iterated in the review on the talk page again good job feel free to contact me with any queries 
 hi again sorry about the delayed response the article is definitely progressing in the right direction i will come back tommorow and attempt at being a bit more specific kindest 
 greetings peter i reread st marys church today the copy editing was very well done thus i passed the article regarding the use of the word quiet well i thought about that for a bit i believe that in the context of the piece that the word is fine regards 
 you have convinced me i moved the page to 
 hi peter please forgive the intrusion i have been browsing your many excellent edits to so many churches bravo i wonder have you ever had a look at 
 good to hear from you yes westminster abbey does have bells recently another editor led me to 
 absolutely many thanks but did you think that the bells might be worthy of mention in the 
 the westminster bells are not on my to do list at present i have confirmed the dates of the redwick bells at the dove site but cannot confirm that they are some of the oldest unfortunately the statement is not referenced by inline citations so there is a problem in verifying it 
 many thanks it might be useful if i added the dove site as a citation for the age of the redwick bells if not for their comparative age 
 per what nonsense you put on my talk page i would like to ask you about what edits are unhelpful or unconstructive 
 oh yes its most likely just 
 well he does not say he is vandalizing it and no one cares too much about the issue when i bring it up all they attempt to say is well maybe you two should take time to talk out the dispute although it is not close to a dispute it is purely simple ignorance as i see it 
 no no no no of course not i meant userlucpol he stalks me around wikipedia alot by tracking my contributions constantly 
 no by commenting in a conversation between you and me here it is clear that he is following my actions 
 well he was but now it seems he is putting his own edit summaries down after i mentioned it 
 re reference N thanks for pointing that out it was a mistake when i was editing the references i was cutting and pasting and apparently had a wikilink cut when i pasted what i thought was another article i have fixed that mistake it shouldnt have been there other than that mistake what did you think of the article 
 its a very interesting read 
 hi there i noticed some of your good work on related waterways and just wondered if in the path of any research you are doing you find anything about the above canal to please feel free to insert im getting the article ready for fac 
 sorry i only have stuff on cheshire canals and then mainly on the ones around runcorn the articles looking pretty good and frighteningly comprehensive good luck with fac 
 thanks you never know though what you may come across im interested in improving all the articles around the nw its such an important area and so many articles are in relatively poor condition im glad you started the m and i navigation as that ties into a lot of the articles i have been working on thanks for the compliment its good to get feedback 
 since the new season of belgian first division introduces new relegation playoff i wanted to ask you if you could modify the roundbyround template so the table can display a lighter shade of red for both N th and N th place i would do it myself but i really dont know how also while making these changes it would be great to somehow make a difference between this seasons and the previous seasons templates so that the N rbr table could still keep the darker shade for the N th position 
 yes sure that makes sense you have a good point i will do it this evening 
 hi dr vardy just thought id let you know that i have now submitted the article on 
 thats great i wish you the best of luck it very much depends on which assessor picks it up some of them can give you a hard time but in the end its usually a good learning process did you realise that 
 no further information was received from you regarding your deletion of the section the confederation debates in february N so i reinstated it in april N to date there have been no other objections 
 possible copyright infringement 
 im afraid you are mistaken you should check the edit history of the article before claiming such a thing because its actually the other way around is most likely copied from wikipedia if you check the dates that article was written in N whereas the 
 i have removed the template above as it seems overkill 
 ps i think the criticism section should go it is the ravings of an ignorant philosopher who knows not what he is talking about in my biased opinion but maybe it needs rewording so as to make it sound less serious 
 unfortunately im not really prepared to edit the article myself for nearly a year now i have stayed well clear of any articles involving the history of science and i dont really intend to return to them any time soon i will leave it to your discretion to decide whats best for the article but if you need any help from me you can always drop a message here regards 
 if you have uploaded other images please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them too you can find a list of image pages you have edited by going to your contributions from your user page and then selecting image from the dropdown box note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on 
 you have other images that are not sourced also please source them or they will have to be deleted thanks 
 i have noticed a lot of good edits on this article from you what say we get it to ga status i have a bit of tidying up to do on my 
 definitely but i do think the article needs quite a lot of rewriting or reformatting before it is anything like decent there is plenty more stuff to come i suspect so i hope more can be added as time goes on nevertheless with reorganisation i think the article could be made ga and with further edits could go towards fa do you 
 most certainly it could be fac there is plenty of information around about it i have just added stuff from the internet thus far library visits have been concerned with other things i will put a request in for it to be copyedited given its importance i think its a good candidate for fa the first canal of the industrial age is most certainly an important subject annoyingly the free trial of the times archive service has now ended so i cant use that unless i pay i do have a page saved about the dukes collieries though i will give you a link to it shortly 
 click all sizes to make it bigger 
 the times archive is still free if you are a member of manchester libraries 
 oooo good tip i shall join then 
 i left a message on the talk page of 
 looks good to me feel free to remove the tag 
 thanks 
 to 
 right im not sure what possessed me there thanks 
 vale royal abbey it is then i have done some work on it previously of course but having been through all the stuff with netley abbey i can see now how far there is to go i have good sources for the history during the monastic period the mediaeval buildings and the limited excavation that has been done but very little for the postdissolution story which is why i left off work on it fortunately i have just tracked down what looks to be a rare monograph on the abbey so that should that should help a lot if i can win it i find the story of vale royal fascinating as its full of high hopes disaster and quite spectacular villainy on all sides such a comedown to end up as a golf club 
 i must admit that i wondered whether any of it would be useful for your research i hope mentioning this is not inappropriate 
 thanks for the info about the ebay site nothing on it at present at a price i want to pay but i will keep an eye on the seller for future bargains best wishes 
 the article was very good i have left a couple of comments in the review rather than passing it straight away but they are very minor and not all of them need to be particularly addressed its on hold for a week and i will see if i can do anything to help 
 hi i passed the article for ga not that this should be surprising you have been doing excellent work 
 i thought you might be interested in this article i created i have got to work this weekend but should be able to add a bit more to it should make a good dyk candidate 
 sorry about the delay have been away interesting article skempton looks a good source maybe one day we could improve the material on the 
 has breached the N rr and add 
 cheers for that i dont like asking this but could you also revert back the stable version as darnotleys unstable version is showing 
 user is now block evading i have issued a 
 hi peter thanks for your kind words im finding it an interesting learning experience some good improvements have been suggested and been incorporated some of the other comments have not been so helpful currently the scoring is three supports and one weak oppose i dont know how many supports the article needs to pass nor how long the process will take we shall see the article is looking good now and thats what i set out to do so i wont mind if it doesnt pass in the end though id like it to i have other abbeys to write about vale royal titchfield and cleeve i can use the lessons i have learned on netley to make them good 
 i think the results in the balance right now the articles prose really has suffered a bit during the fac which seems to be the main reason for the oppose it ought to be fairly easy to tighten up the prose now that the content and layout are pretty much sorted and with that done the opposer may be persuaded to at least withdraw his or her opposition which might well be enough to see you over the line i think 
 i thought that if the case was old enough that it still had the rfcu macro that spiclose was used to close it and mdash 
 that one is more recent and was created when we implemented the new system no harm done though i will just fix it 
 its really twinkle being still outdated 
 i have been watching your work at lyme with admiration but i just wondered why you thought the style needed amending i would have thought palladian was spot on as in england italianate and means a more N th century style preferably with a belvedere verandahs terraces etc just a thought 
 thanks for your comments i have been struggling with describing the architectural style of the house i am no expert in architecture so i am relying on the sources which i hope are the most reliable referring to the south front images of england says for a garden front it is magnificent but more baroque than palladian and makes no other reference to palladian style pevsner says but his great south front is not a palladian front so i have settled for the national trusts safer use of italianate broader but maybe less controversial do you have any better references or sources i do not intend to fight over this really i just want to avoid the attention of pedantic editors 
 as an editor of 
 after my last message i found a booklet produced by the national trust published in N which is also very quizzical about whether it is true palladian or not so i have changed the lead in a way that i hope will satisfy most while being true to the sources what do you think i may add a footnote in due course incidentally im pleased you are working on the leoni article it certainly needs some proper referencing with inline citations good luck 
 are you sure that this 
 i agree and i was not clear why this discussion started here rather than on the talk page of the article so i have copied the discussion to 
 no i think there is suposed to be a designated ga designated discussion page somewhere i will have a look and see what other people do 
 it seems you were right first time other ga candidiates are languishing on a similarly isolated pages no wonder they are rarely reviewed 
 were you looking for 
 it seems we should be here after all i just thought it was the wrong place because no one else was there after so long 
 nice work on 
 good close on 
 thank you thank you bask bask wriggle wriggle 
 just to clarify the ga reviewer usually creates that gan page when he or she posts the ga review following which its used for subsequent discussion of the review and a permanent archive of what was decided and agreed once the review is closed everything else including suggestions for improvement should be on the articles talk page 
 thanks thats what i thought so what do we do about whats on the gan page i feel it might get in the way a potential reviewer might think the review has already been started should the comment be removed not sure about the protocol in this sort of situation 
 already sorted like you i thought it would be confusing to a potential reviewer so i have moved everything to talk 
 brilliant thanks a million 
 i just need to get the review page deleted now so that the talk page header doesnt incorrectly say that the article is being reviewed and then everything should be ok 
 all fixed now and the article is being reviewed good luck 
 or styleverticalalign top bordertop N px solid gray or for all of your many contributions to dyk centering on uk humanities i hereby award you the N dyk medal wear it with pride 
 many thanks its been fun 
 just havent seen you around in awhile hope things are going well for you i have always had best wishes for you and continue to hope that whatever you do that you are enjoying it and hope to bump into you soon 
 thank you i havent been feeling very well lately actually but i think things may be starting to turn around 
 you do alot of work on churches in the north west and you also submit alot of dyks i wondered would you be willing to have a look at this one 
 thanks for the invitation comments on the articles talk page 
 hi josh just wanted to run something past you regarding these eastenders characters whose articles will never be more than a short paragraph or two i honestly dont think they all need their own articles on here so i have started work on a list of minor characters in eastenders i have looked in the eastenders stub category to see which ones i think should be included and so far i have twelve characters (
 thanks for your reply i disagree and i cant see anything about every character needing its own page but im not going to change anything anyway 
 its fine to add in england to the gothic revival architecture category but when there is gothic architecture in the church as well as gothic revival please do not delete it its a bother to revert it thanks 
 gothic revival is a subcategory of gothic so no need for both rgds 
 your argument is not supported in any of the relevant wp articles 
 the link is 
 peter great points the problem we have here is that when new editors want to add a new article most will copy an existing article hence you only need one gothic and gothic revival categorised article to be copied and then for more established editors to copy the precedent and we resultantly have both categories stuffed to the brim with the same articles making the two categories pointless i am not an architectural expert just an amateur fan of great design but from a wikipedia view point the question if articles should appear in both sections is why do you need both categories i think we have to make academically and encyclopedicly defined decisions in such cases and focus groups here are the best way to define the policy i thank you for your input great discussion and please let me know the outcome and if ever i can help you please just ask with best regards 
 hi peter i replied on tridents page theres a clear distinction between gothic and gothic revival im not convinced by his arguments above about new users and editor incompetence etc im not especially militant about categories but if you want some further support give me a buzz regards 
 have you read 
 okay im just thinking of all the other users whose preferences are set up to display october N N or something else rather than N october N is that your birthday 
 bless 
 i really didnt mean to sound patronising please accept my most sincere apologies with this delicious looking muffin 
 i didnt mean to sound patronising then either im just sorry 
 hi there i dont mean to be nosey im curious to know your rationale behind removing the england wikilink from articles about towns or villages in cheshire assumed that this was a standard wikilink in such articles and it seems a pretty widespread practice elsewhere unless im missing something perhaps i have missed something at 
 sorry about the above i have just noticed that england isnt wikilinked in the uk geog guidelines 
 im trying to keep up with changes which seem to be happening wikilinking words like england and dates seems to have become deprecated see 
 thanks for the headsup will give the new citation template a go also need to get to grips with harvard style referencing 
 i think that 
 the ip that keeps vandalising todays featured article do you know if anyone has made a request for an admin block 
 i know just double checking that i wasnt duplicating some one elses report thanks mate 
 all good where on earth do these idiots come from ah well 
 i agree the pattern looks like a school kinda depressing to think idiots like this are my countrymen ah well 
 peter i have just noticed this try editing now as i think i may have cleared an autoblock that was preventing you from editing if you can edit other articles i will post the appropriate unblock request accepted message if not i will try again for you 
 ah beaten to it by another 
 thanks ok now i must say the response was pretty quick 
 did she die i dont remember her dying someone wrote an article about her and said she died please help 
 i thought she didnt die but i couldnt remember what did happen thanks 
 no im afraid not and i cant easily get to a library that has it i do have the books by my wifes grandfather moshe svorai which may cover the same material what is it that you want email me if you would rather you know my address 
 have you thought of looking on google books in hebrew i will give it a go later 
 i have been building a list of turnpike trusts in greater manchester which eventually should be a good basis for improving similar articles around the region i just wondered if you had any books at hand that could help with this list i have one on order and my list is here 
 i have virtually nothing on this other than the road between runcorn and northwich was turnpiked in N i can give you a reference for this if it is of any use i have nothing on the rest of cheshire and runcorn was of course a cul de sac you could always try 
 i now remember i have phillips and phillips historical atlas of cheshire which has a bit if you could email me with your postal address at pvardy@doctorsorguk i could send you photocopies of what there is some of the roads are now of course in greater manchester 
 i will bear it in mind i will be off to central library in manchester soon to get the rest of the details i need the page im building is its very far from finished im also building a map of all turnpikes in gm that should take quite a while 
 good luck hope it goes well happy new year 
 i have left some comments on the list of grade i lbs in runcorn and i think that with everyones comments you could probably skip peer review scheduled monuments on the other hand are much more difficult to get information about pastscape is generally reliable and does tell you if a sites scheduled either under the main description or listed as a scheduled monument notification under the sources the problem is you cant search for just scheduled monuments some local authorities might provide lists of sms on their websites but its hit and miss i just checked and i couldnt find one for halton ages ago i started a list of the 
 i feared as much so i will work through the websites but its a good idea to email jill collens i met her when i was chairman of the local history society i will do that in the new year best wishes for N peter 
 just a quick note to say how impressed i am with the work you have done on this article i dont agree with all of the comments being made at its flc especially about the text size but needs must when the devil drives very nice work that fully deserves to be promoted i was particularly impressed to see that youd taken all of the photos yourself 
 thanks for that dealing with all the comments has been a bit of a challenge but i have also learnt a lot and at last i have got one support like you i dont agree with all of the comments but i have have gone along with them unless i feel strongly or they are wrong etc interesting that the commentators ask questions that are already answered in the text my main reason for embarking on this is to have something featured that relates to cheshire and to cheshire alone cheers 
 cheshires got a good collection of gas going on N compares favourably to 
 i too like the map of all coordinates but take no credit for it it was added by 
 the energy in the gm project is quite astonishing god knows where it comes from lol 
 i didnt enjoy the fac process with runcorn some helpful comments but too much aggro for me im content that it is a ga and vastly better than when i started editing on wp i see it gets over N visits a month so thank goodness its been improved 
 hey as i know you are an active member of wpfooty can you help me with 
 the ndash is incorrect though as it is only a N month loan deal should they sign him permanently it will require a new line anyway 
 to be honest i am a bit unclear over how much of the design work was really his the general design seems to have been guided by a committee with input from the navy before arriving at a general design detailed finishing seems then to have been done by designers at the two yards which each built a slightly different ships lusitania and mauretania actually with significant differences which must have required entirely different plans other people designed the inrteriors so i am a tad unhappy at giving him billing in the first sentence of the article 
 peskett says in i believe the titanic inquiry that he was ultimately responsible for the lusitanias design my impression from the sources i have read is that he was the overall architect for the ships and had a significant role 
 he is the person who gets named but you know how it is these things get simplified one of the issues on my checklist for the article is exactly what he did do he was the company naval architect who drew up some sort of plans for an initial design but this seems to have been entirely rewritten once the navy became involved the original plans had three funnels which implies a significantly different layout then turbines were a late addition and the stern design was not finished until after building had started because they were still deciding about propulsion the turbines themselves were built by the main contractor so did they simultaneously redesign the ship i would guess there was a lot of coming and going about the propellors which went up from N to N none of which says peskett wasnt making all the changes but it is another of those things which is unclear i was puzzled about the statements that design details were left to the yards i dont undertsand how lusitania and mauretania ended up with mauretania significantly bigger despite both being to pesketts plans for a pair of ships my first thought was that swan hunter deliberately made mauretania bigger so that their ship would hold the world size speed etc records instead of lusitania but if they made such major changes off their own bat it doesnt sound as if peskett had such huge input then again i could imagine cunard being happy to claim the world record with their new ship lusitania and then a few months later get the publicity all over again when mauretania came along maybe it is the way victorians thought but the navy made ships in batches to the same designs so why would cunard create two different designs when ordering two ships at the same time to the same government specification for the same route so there is a puzzle here somewhere i think the reality must be that the two yards had major influence on the designs and then there is the question of what input came from the navy and their model testing tank people i suspect that the reality was you decided roughly what size ship you wanted and what layout and then a shipyard would sort out the details obviously it did have the capability to do this but where did the balance lie in this case 
 i wouldnt be surprised if there were committees pushback on designs collaboration and so on im not sure where we could look to get this level of insight though perhaps there were minutes taken at the design meetings but were they published anywhere 
 sorry peter i hope my very late comments dont derail the thing i hadnt realised there was a time limit i feel badly about listing some of these things rather than fixing them but im deeply into several different projects at the moment several of which i hope will make it to dyk if i can but get my act together meanwhile i hope you have a peaceful and productive N 
 thats fine your comments are valid and we want the cheshire material to be good i will do what i can when i get a good connection thanks for your good wishes 
 this is an automated notice by 
 i think its a good idea but i dont know anything about those particular spinoffs 
 because i recognised srx i hadnt clicked on their name to see who they were its lucky you pointed that out because i was rather annoyed with someone opposing on what seemed to be just the use of commas i have implemented all of the comma changes suggested although they dont all feel right if you think they are wrong feel free to change them back i will be a bit pushed for time today but i will help out where i can 
 im thinking of withdrawing the nomination i have addressed or at least answered all the points made to date but every amendment seems to lead to more problems the consensus at the moment is N support and N oppose i have changed all the descriptions into complete sentences that will give unlimited opportunities for commacomments i will give it N hours 
 i know exactly how you are feeling right now peter uN about the nomination not about the viral infection of course in my mercifully few encounters with the flc process i have also found it to be arbitrary and frustrating far more so than fac the most trivial objections come flying out of the woodwork claiming that there are standards for things like column colours that nobody else except the opposer has ever even heard of much less agreed on nevertheless id encourage you to stick with it who knows how it will end up im going to add my support in any event the article deserves no less 
 thanks a million malleus you are a pal peter 
 i completely agree with what malleus said the article certainly has my support thats why i got involved it feels like some comments are based on 
 thanks another pal 
 i think it would be premature to withdraw peter im through with one of my pet projects now so if i can get another one done this evening i will get on with having a run through the lead after which i will be happy to add my formal support as to the column colours i rather like the idea particularly now they have been altered to be editable it certainly seems necessary to explain the difference between grade ii and grade ii carefully cheers 
 hey will i was about to drop a note at 
 makes five though his involvement was a while ago iirc his position was to keep the guideline as is but create redirects to facilitate linking and ndash 
 right i forgot chuq was an admin thanks anthony uN 
 i know this is kinda weird responding to one persons question on another persons talk page but heres my input first of all the dzogchen page is severly lacking i have a collection of books on the subject and i hope to sit down and do a rewrite someday but i also have a vision of rewriting the 
 theres a zen saying a lot like that before we study zen the mountains are mountains and the rivers are rivers while we are studying zen however the mountains are no longer mountains and the rivers are no longer rivers but then when our study of zen is completed the mountains are once again mountains and the rivers once again rivers 
 exactly its not the spoon that bends its only yourself 
 now i have a problem following the last comment by doncram i should like to split the list back into sections as it was originally this makes more sense to me gets rid of a column and those awful colours and offers a toc but it now has N supports and no opposes and the N days is close do i split it into three sections (
 and now i have added some external links which has produced a toc under the list which looks ridiculous 
 i have moved the table of contents if you want to suppress it then just change the toc i added to notoc now that you have got four supports and the deadline is drawing close id be inclined not to rock the boat and leave things as they are for now actually i quite like that coloured column anyway 
 that sounds like the voice of wisdom thanks for sorting out the toc i think i will just sort the refs into numerical order and then wait to see what happens 
 the article list is eastenders cast members by year of exit so its a list for the actors who appeared in eastenders isnt it so why should it make any differnce if their character doesnt get its own page 
 trampikey why are you turning it around to be characters i thought we agreed to vote on or discuss major changes such as this also why cant minor and nonnotable characters be added to the list since when is notability an issue in this project several nonnotable and minor characters already have their own pages and you protested against my page for minor characters so i stopped working on it 
 looks like its been successful congratulations 
 thats great many many many thanks to all who have helped 
 please 
 well just please stop dragging up the past im here to improve this encyclopaedia and it was agreed i could stay on good faith 
 hi peter i have left a strong keep with reasons on the deletion debate page for 
 i dont think theres any danger of this article being deleted the nomination is clearly absurd 
 aye i cannot see see a rational justification for nominating this article for deletion dr peter and his coconspirators in the cheshire tribe obviously have plans ahead for when they can get their mitts on sources but this is a building that is recognised as being of national importance 
 i doubt the article would be deleted consensus seems to be leading that way and its clearly notable 
 i think this is probably a genuine mistake with the nominator mistaking grade ii for grade ii i have left a note on his talk page but i dont think theres any danger of deletion sorry my request has caused all this fuss peter 
 thanks everyone for your great support i have been out for some hours and it seems there has been some activity in my absence glad you all agree with me and its important for the development of the work we are doing 
 below is a lot of help peter let me know if i can do anything i am voting on the page right now 
 racing to add miniden to the articles instead of watching the episode 
 i so knew someone was adding that straight away unfortunately i was busy eating its annoying being beaten 
 i know this isnt the place to talk about it but i thought it was so sad when keith and demi were saying goodbye if you wanna talk about eastenders perhaps we could go offwiki 
 yes but i dont really want to print my email address on here erm could you activate your email link you could just do it temporarily to email me with your msn address and then deactivate it afterwards if you dont want it activated all the time 
 i came to this very late but i agree with malleus that the nomination is absurd though i think the nominator didnt know much about the topic and made a mistake about the grading system i am a bit more perturbed by the fact that the article had only been created N minutes before the afd was slapped onto it and it clearly to me didnt seem to be the kind of sparse article that would merit such a quick nomination to then claim it was almost advertising when the nominator had clearly not looked at the editing history of peter or his contributions seemed to be almost a failure in 
 from discussion with the nominator i believe it was a genuine mistake in overlooking the star it does look as if theres widespread consensus among editors that grade ii denotes automatic notability though i dont think the same would necessarily be true of grade ii im more and more thinking that one of the few benefits of being an admin is being exempt from the oversight process at article creation stage 
 the decision was speedy keep so many thanks to you all for your speedy contributions to this i was interested to discover the existence of 
 if your page is deleted you still 
 congratulations on your speedy keep i am very happy for you consider joining the 
 cheers 
 i have not looked at the article again but would suggest that expansion should include details of what court used to use the house i have come across various references to manor courts meeting in the gatehouse of a manor house or castle 
 okay obviously i pushed the wrong button i will stop leaving ridiculous messages on your talk page since you so request sorry 
 you are invited to comment on the content dispute regarding 
 thanks for inviting me to the discussion i have added a comment at that same page regards 
 i dont think it matters that the project has few active contributors as long as we agree its worth keeping it going the projects that have been suspended have essentially no activity over months i wouldnt suggest asking everyone directly whether they are still interested but a newsletter might be a useful way of stimulating interest with the side effect that those who have moved on will tell us so my recent comments on getting the portal featured seem to have stirred up quite a bit of interest so hopefully some new article work will ensue if you had a moment your comments and suggestions on the 
 hope you are winning your struggles with your internet provider also with the gmc that sounds deeply annoying cheers 
 i had an excellent holiday thanks my first skiing trip since injuring my back a few years ago there was so much snow i didnt even get tempted by an internet cafxeN im sorry to hear about your ongoing struggles with your internet provider we decided to change recently to reduce our internet costs and it was a lot of hassle even though the old provider wasnt being obstructive the gmc thing sounds like pure extortion cheers 
 please refrain from undoing other peoples edits repeatedly if you continue you may be 
 you love me really 
 maybe 
 apparently he will still be in prison but no idea what he will be doing why cant this be discussed on the articles talk page rather than on a users talk page trampikey isnt the only person with the answer 
 peter there seem to be two new civil parishes that have been created in halton judging by edits to 
 i have heard something vague about this i will look into it in the next few days 
 thanks i will edit the parish template and we can proceed with a couple of stubs for them i think but we could do with a bit more information first 
 i have created very small stubs i am not sure where the boundaries are or much more about them sorry 
 thats all right thanks for doing that i suggest we all keep an eye on the articles and periodically try to see if there is more information about them as being new they might otherwise be swiftly nominated for deletion i have just noticed that they are already marked on the and so maps of their extent could be made i may get around to doing the maps if you think it would be helpful 
 yes please you may have discovered that im not really into local government now give me heritage 
 ok i never made any conscious decision to get into local government it just happened and i slid into it without giving it much thought now i think it is a large part of what i have been doing especially the history bit given the work on hundreds ancient parishes in my sandbox a list of the former districts planned ones on former civil parishes poorlaw unions and sanitary districts and so on none of them have really been ultimately the result of a seriously thoughtout conscious decision to work mostly on local government areas 
 thanks 
 id be tempted to make page for 
 i unblocked one of the autoblocked addresses let me know if it worked 
 ok i unblocked the autoblocked address from 
 ok they have been removed now as well just one of the problems with editing from aol im afraid 
 i just noticed you are making the list in your sandbox and i like the way its done although you will need a key to explain that sm no and her no mean scheduled monument and historic environment number respectively i would query whether its important to mention them as they dont tell you specifically about the monument and since those details are in the database you have access to rather than pastscape it might not fly at flc the remains section though is something i will definitely be stealing using for gm and since there are so many sams for gm that dont have articles i will probably use a description column too 
 thanks its in havery early even experimental stage at present really just collecting some info and ideas its going to be big so im not sure at this stage how much description there will be its taking a lot of time at present i am in the N s of a database of nearly N yes keys are necessary i will probably not bother with the her numbers but as a reference document i think the sm numbers should be there i have started including a reference to the arevealing cheshires past site for the latest entries you might like to have a peep at one of them to see the sort of info it includes i think its going to take quite a time and id like to add coordinates if i can find the sites with help of best of luck peter 
 period would be an interesting way of dividing the list but would by district be more practical 
 ah i hadnt thought about warrington and halton it wouldnt make sens to have lists with one or two items but when dividing by location only current administrative boundaries makes sense so probably best to dismiss that idea on reflection period seems like the best bet although why N it seems like an arbitrary date rather than one recognised as important in british history did you mean N also thered be scope for further division if necessary such as prehistory roman to medival and postmedieval to modern 
 forgot to say go for it with egertonwarburton its hardly trial by fire for an article so well referenced and written and should easily pass imo 
 thanks again yes it should be N i will probably ask for a bit of copy editing on the r ew article and then go for gac 
 just to let you know salakapurusas had been moved to the queue at 
 dont worry we all make mistakes 
 she could vandalise and people would think it was me at a glance 
 try not to 
 please could somebody help me i need to put the three boxes on my 
 also can someone make it so the archives box on this page doesnt clash with any messages i get 
 i done your user page for you i dunno if this is what you wanted on your talk page though 
 oooh it looks cool good job j di ps trampikey i like your awards page 
 i kinda wanted it so that the messages started underneath the archive box leaving a blank rectangle between the leave a message box the archive bo and the top of the messages can anyone do that 
 like that 
 yeah thanks a lot 
 no worries you might want to put that stuff up there on a subpage and transclude it so theres less stuff 
 i noticed youd created an article for hubbard i wonder if you have got another source you could add the dyk people were getting quite sticky last i looked in about material drawn from a single source 
 thanks for that i have searched the internet and found nothing of value i think i will add a quote from pevsners introduction to cheshire and hope thats enough 
 yes i had a quick root around and came up dry otherwise id have just added something 
 well its got the tick of approval 
 excellent i keep meaning to submit something but im off on holiday next week so perhaps when i get back 
 thanks 
 excellent suggestion i have implemented a solution which removed about N articles from the orphan lists so we have avoided a lot of future hassle at little cost but yeah that or graph subpage should be in the template namespace 
 please dont disclose private information of other contributors without their permission this goes against some wikipedia policy somewhere that i cant find right now maybe it doesnt exist and im making it up meh i will find it 
 yeah if i wanted my name displayed id display it p thanks for the belated birthday cake it was delicious 
 i have recently been expanding the 
 you may have noticed that i have got rid of the her ref no but kept the sm no the latter is the nationally recognised code for that particular item and i personally feel it is an essential field in the list it helps to prevent confusion and duplication cheshire cc and pastscape vary considerably in their titles i presume the map of coordinates works only with coordinates they are after all universal while os mrs will only apply to gb i have just added it to the preN list and it does not work but i was told at flc that it takes up to N hours for google to sort it out so i will wait and see images better poor ones than none can i suggest that the best one be used as a lead image at N px to make a striking first impression for the viewer also how about making the images appear as near as possible to the description i shall not be able to do it with my unsectioned lists but you could split the images between the sections (have a look 
 N makes life easier when writing the list but is a bit disappointing theres enough information for pretty much every entry in the gm list to be fleshed out and prevent it looking unbalanced but doing the same for N + monuments will me a mammoth task since i started the descriptions from scratch it was easy to write in full sentences and although the criteria is professional prose my impression is they are much less fussy about the quality at flc than they are at fac how are you thinking about splitting the postN list would medieval and postmedieval produce balanced lists 
 the business with the images was done to stop the edits being all over the place with some browsers i have used the technique quite a lot and it is feasible with separate sections see how its done in 
 ps just found N more postmed and modern ones im sure there are more to come 
 im whiskers from the nindb forums really 
 yes the exact one and only its nice to meet you here did you read my profile N N march N 
 i have just created a short article on the former elizabethan mansion of rocksavage in clifton and proposed it for dyk if you happened to be online and could improve it that would be very helpful im hoping that you might even have some photos of the ruins in any case i hope your internet connection is fixed very soon cheers 
 thanks for the article i feel guilty because this is one i should have written so thanks for filling the gap i am in the middle of a brief visit to wp from my daughters computer but have added a N image rather poor but thats all there is now hope to be online at home from tuesday but i will have many hours of catchingup to do 
 thanks a lot for the photo peter the article appears to have been approved for dyk in my absence so theres no hurry to expand looking forward to your return to net access 
 as i mentioned on the project page im keen to have a project meet up any suggestions as to where might work for you cheers 
 excellent news on rowland egertonwarburton you beat me to it on the portal blurb will try to get one written today (now done see 
 first rate blurb many thanks will reply to your other points in due course 
 thanks for the barnstar though im seriously not bothered by the comments its very easy not to take things persoanlly when someone doesnt actually know you personally 
 ditto 
 sure i will work on him next i will do creation section first then i will bulk up his storylines 
 ahh thanks that was a nice thing to say ive done the development section you might want to include more stuff about the book hes in though i have added a bit on it but you may think more could be included 
 i just thought id let you know that i have for the article and think that with so many pictures available we probably should go for the top spot of the dyk section 
 thanks for that i thought it was a bit bare but it was late i have made amendments to both hooks and added two images wonder what they will make of it 
 sorry to be so slow but i have added another suggested hook with another set of images i hope this is more helpful than confusing in my experience the dyk regulars arent too keen on lists so it might be worth adding to the lead if theres anything more that can be teased out 
 thanks for the suggestion i dont thing i will add any more to the lead as i am getting messages that the article is too long at N kilobytes so i will take a chance on it 
 i dont blame you for not wanting to edit it its extremely slow to save or preview i have checked against the crewe and nantwich list and you have all the sites in this borough before N 
 good work on 
 thanks for that i didnt realise the size of the challenge when i took it on i think its worthwhile because there doesnt seem to be an accessible comprehensive list anywhere else i asked jill collens county archaeologist about it and she put me on to arevealing cheshires past and another site this seems to have a complete list but when i downloaded and unzipped it i could not open it because it was a gis file i have been in touch with claire hughes of the national monuments records enquiry and research services who has promised to send me a complete list of the sms in cheshire so i should be able to check the other two bridges and all the others i have missed phew 
 just a quick note if you havent already noticed awadewit has raised a query regarding the sourcing of the dyk hook i have asked exactly what is required as the article seems to me very adequately sourced and it would be a pity if it missed out on a technicality cheers 
 thanks i think we have lost this one my response is somewhat emotive late on the day of our familys big birthday i might turn into malleus f if this sort of thing continues to happen i only offered this as a dyk as a bit of fun and publicity for the cheshire project life is too short 
 i suspect its just that the amount of work needed to check such a list is large i have had a go the only problem i found is that there appear to be N crosses i suspect i counted marton grange cross and you didnt anyway we shall see whether my checking is considered sufficient im feeling very disheartened by the whole business with malleus 
 malleus leaving would be a waste and i hope that after time away from wikipedia he will choose to return if the numbers are still a problem for awadewit we could go with a more ambiguous hook just mentioning the type of monuments 
 see 
 aieee this is territory in which angels fear to tread the principle is certainly good but it seems that the application leaves something to be desired if even radiant who was the one who bravely dropped the marker on 
 peter i was going to email you but i realise your email isnt enabled i have left my email enabled for now if you want to email me otherwise my blog is at if you comment on a recent post there we can perhaps get into contact cheers 
 is this a retirement from wikipedia its been a bad week for editors from the north west 
 i hope not i have emailed ea and await a reply i presume you know about 
 id noticed ddstrtchs notice of resignation and i dont think malleus is coming back wpukgeo cant afford this never mind wpches this is a setback for the cheshire project and i think cheshire will find it more difficult to absorb the loss losing three prolific editors is dispiriting but i will be hanging around as my approach to wikipedia is slightly selfish i spend a lot of time on subjects im interested in and expanding articles is a way for me to learn more about them and its a far more effective way of making information stick than just reading it 
 like you i am selfish writing and amending articles which interest me perhaps it is a method for survival in wikipedia i too shall be staying around and trying to keep out of trouble i feel i have something to offer to current and future readers two of the three above seem to have run into difficulties after becoming admins i have no intention of following them and im not really interested in doing things for the portal but i shall of course try to support you in anything you do for it 
 in my experience article writing and ndash even at fac and ndash is much less stressful than getting involved in places like rfa ddstretch and espresso addict are or were much more active admins than myself i generally just act when i see a problem rather than going looking for trouble theres a perception that wikipedia is failing im not sure i agree with this but malleus thought that and got involved to try to improve this place its not right to disenfranchise oneself and id like to see wikipedia improve but you cant fight every battle 
 hey i looked it up its victoria woodward 
 i looked at the credits the episode is on my pvr but i havent watched it yet theres no kate credited in that episode someone called cahil though played by john ashton which episode did kate appear 
 hey i have taken a clearer and larger capture of dot for the infobox would you mind if i change the current image by uploading this new version over the one that you uploaded or would you prefer to keep that one for somewhere else in the article 
 re the minor images thats cool i will try and take them as often as i can from now on i have got johnnys cell mate if thats a help and also chrissie watts lawyer but cant remember her name has she got her own article 
 only recent episodes really as i just discovered i can transfer episodes from my pvr to my pc in order to take the captures i have some newish episodes on my pvr harddrive that i havent been arsed to delete yet so if you want characters from september or october i can help with those if you can remember the exact date a character appeared that would help too i also have some random images of minor old characters i have sonias boyfriend enrique the woman who kidnapped vicki called audrey and kats original boyfriend who showed up at the slaters on the first night drunk but they will never likely get articles anyway lol 
 knowing trampikey they will have articles by the end of the night and mdash 
 ok will have a look through got the last N episodes of august here too also which character was the midwife who kept going on about an eppidoodle 
 i have just made trimming about N kb of info from the refs in 
 thats a giant job many many thanks and believe it or not the articles got the top spot in one of the queues for dyk 
 it didnt take that long but pastscape is down at the moment so i can double check that the links still work it wasnt a big task really it only took a few minutes thank goodness they chose the article i thought the boat had been missed maybe not the first choice of hook but at this stage any publicity is good publicity 
 heres the priest but couldnt find his article (
 thanks i havent had a look for those ones yet but should hopefully get a chance to do it later tonight when i get in getting a shot of petal is quite difficult cos shes always snuggling into the people who hold her shes so cute though 
 thanks i will have a look at that episode tonight if i have it and see if i can get a decent one 
 not bad at all but you should consider whether you should limitt he lists to those you can show to be notable enouguh for an article it will avoid challenges N N march N 
 sorry not sure what you mean the disambig page was created to avoid an article i had created (now 
 i noticed that you reverted my edits from 
 re it seems as if there isnt a very reliable source anywhere then regarding what the official name is all i am saying is the last official source said gibbs though i suppose it isnt worth reverting the edits unless that is officially confirmed elsewhere 
 as promised the article has gone live what i have tried to do is give a brief run down of who what when and why for each castle although for some very little info is available as such the entries vary in size i think with a bit of polish its ready to go to flc id like your opinion on the article as a whole if you have time particularly the map i made and thats being used as a lead image it doesnt look as good as the greater manchester one did probably because there are more castles and they are closer together it ends up looking a little bit messy and im wondering whether it would be worth redoing it or maybe have one of the other images in the article as a lead image also are there any unanswered questions from the lead cheers 
 it looks promising well done i have done few tweaks and added images including a lead image as an eyecatcher no reason why we should not have the map as well it is not particularly clear and googletype pointers might be better but i have no idea how to do maps so cannot help here sorry i have not had time to have a detailed look at the notes would it be a good thing to state somewhere or somehow that most or all of the castles are scheduled monuments apart from some demanding social or family factors im a bit involved at present in working on 
 ps i think the lead is ok for a list 
 i had noticed the churches in your sandbox and wondered what the plan was with such a large list i knew douglas was prolific but i had no idea hed been involved in so many places it seems inevitable that when writing articles about cheshire that you will stumble across douglas i assume you will be removing the list of works from his biography once the stuff in your sandbox goes into the mainspace 
 i find douglas fascinating and so am spending a lot of time on him the general plan is to expand the biography article and remove the works from it creating four separate lists but it will take some time and i shall be out of wp action for most of may and i have discovered the 
 not bad i think but if you come up with one you think is better dont hesitate to add it as an alternative 
 that looks fine should be no problem 
 hey can you have a look over this 
 not at all edit away 
 whoops i just thanked ap for moving the page but noticed it was you who moved it so thanks for doing that 
 just wondering whether i was gonna get an answer i see that i may have forgotten to sign my last message so that may be the answer i was to why i havent heard from you having said that id still like to know your reasoning for replacing the uN cproper quotesuN d and also why you are completely changing the format leaving out the description of the character listed some of these characters are rather obscure and i feel more information is always better than less i think this perhaps should be put up for discussion before continuing to deleting whats otherwise pretty useful data 
 hello peter i noticed that you delinked england on the 
 thanks for your query i used to overlink until i became more familiar with the rationale for linking perhaps the best guide is 
 hi the article was deleted because it was really short one and had no sources i invite you to start it from scratch and address the issues i mentioned regards 
 it appears your bot deleted an image i posted claiming that it was a scaled down version of another image however it didnt tell me where the larger image is located which is a little bit frustrating because i cant remember could you look that up and let me know thanks 
 thanks for finding it yeah i agree its weird they didnt include it i find the message as a whole to be quite ugly actually do you know where the template is 
 yeah its 
 the article is wellwritten im just not certain the cases are truly notable they dont seem to be major precedents or anything like that could you find references to the court cases in nationally published law reviews or nonregional news coverage of the firm 
 get back to the bs and mdash 
 lol well im glad you did the osmans because im not really aware of them so i didnt notice sue and any other wrong family members wanna trade some i can get awb to automatically remove italics from the family secion i worked it out and mdash 
 i guess part of the problem here might be knowing whether some of these things were designed by douglas himself or by his practice 
 thanks for that and for the copyediting you have spotted my fudging and the reason for it but hubbard has the same problem in his biography we shall never know which individual in the office designed precisely what although i guess douglas usually had the last word but its difficult under the subtitle of a partnership to say douglas designed i appreciate your help and support 
 maybe it would be better then to explicity say for instance that douglass practice was commissioned to carry out work on two churches in association with gladstone btw just a personal preference but i much prefer douglass to douglas 
 just to let u know that i have seen the episode with her in and she is alis sister 
 yeh i have that one their mother is in it as well but she doesnt speak just sobs so isnt credited with a name at the end 
 no worries just noticed the convo so thought should let u know i think its pronounced ize 
 im just letting you know that im about to start reading through the article and sorry its been a few days since you asked you might also like to know that i have expanded the 
 a welldeserved gaclass article and now a gaclass article possibly a faclass article 
 congratulations on the fa award i knew it was a good article 
 hi peter no doubt you will tell me if im being thick but surely churches in the diocese of st asaph are not part of the province of york and havent been since N when the church in wales and the church of england parted company regards 
 thanks you are right of course sorry i will correct my errors cheers 
 no problems i have corrected three or four for you already nice work by the way regards 
 hey anon if it were me id try to organize it in straight chronology rather than trying to segment off her relationships and business interests especially since the two are heavily intertwined with her marriage to grdina but i dont have time to do it myself so i cant really complain i guess 
 thanks i organized it on the model of the other 
 congratulations on all the hard work towards ga for 
 id be glad to help by doing a peer review which almost always includes a few copyediting suggestions i looked at the article quickly just now and read the lede fairly carefully everything looks good to me at first glance it might take me a couple of days to work up a full set of comments which i will post to the peer review page for the article 
 your amendments all look fine to me i responded on the peer review page but thought i would post a short note here too i had one further thought the caricature looks a little big to me i thought so on the first round but didnt think to mention it i tried adding an upright parameter to the image template to make the image a bit smaller i couldnt decide whether this looked better or not and so i didnt save the change but you might want to try it to see which size you prefer in answer to your question about lists i have reviewed only two or three and im still learning id be happy to give it a try when the time comes but you might also want to make a formal peer review request in hopes of attracting multiple reviewers best of luck with john douglas at fac 
 the fac nomination procedure guidelines near the top of 
 your hard work has secured what i think it the north wests first good topic nicely done 
 thanks you spotted it before me it seemed to take ages after consensus for it to be accepted now for john douglas 
 i would like to thank you for your contributions to wikipedia however it is recommended that you use the 
 lol oh god super nanny strikes again the name you were after is enzo squllino jnr 
 it looks like john douglas just got to fa great stuff and thoroughly well deserved im just disappointed i didnt get round to adding my support to the nomination 
 thanks i am pleased about this for two reasons first i regard it as the first true fa in the cheshire wikiproject the other two are really passing through cheshire the 
 hi dr vardy have you been listing your wikiproject wales dyk contributions bye for now ~ 
 i think so i will check when i have time 
 im about to start an article on cheshires maiden castle and i was looking to 
 im all for using common pieces of text for common purposes but the explanations for the namenot so sure maidun is certainly plausible but a maiden looking impregnable i quite like the third possible origin which comes later in the article never been taken a sort of parallel with virgin no big deal just musing 
 well i should give 
 thats a pretty good article i dont know how you get so much information so well organised noweddisbury sometime theres a rather poor photo i put on commons but at least it shows the general topography i took some others but did not feel they were worth uploading good luck at gac should walk it 
 the picture of maiden castle isnt great and while 
 hi peter thank you for the edit to 
 thanks for the article i have added some details about the architect and done a few tweaks hope they are ok yes do go ahead with the double dyk N N july N 
 excellent changes thank you 
 hi again i just wanted to let you know that i have 
 excellent good luck no reason why you should not make it 
 first of all great work on 
 hi i have finished formatting the references using citation templates and the naming format you mentioned feel free to have a look to see if anything is missing regards 
 i have had a go at fixing the sorting for the listed buildings around runcorn it works by adding xx before each date the table then sorts by whatever the hidden text is so i usually go for N N N etc it works fine for me but you might want to check for yourself the only problem is deciding where early or mid or late go but see what you think of the order i have chosen 
 you have probably noticed that 
 no problem i personally like the lists separate too flc has gone in a funk recently about content forking and short lists because in the past editors could pass tenitem musicians awards lists through flc and call them our best work however your buildings list does not qualify as such and as you said numbers arent everything there are other things to be considered in 
 i just wondered how you know this pornographic film is a spoof of eastenders if you have seen it id be interested to know in what ways it spoofs eastenders if you havent seen it then we should just say the title of the film spoofs the name of the show unless you have read about it i know 
 there seem to be four arearenders films i have changed the article accordingly and mdash 
 i find these alt texts very hard to write as well the best advice i have seen is to imagine yourself trying to explain the image to someone you are speaking to on the telephone i have rewritten the alt text for the lead image to give an idea of how i interpret whats needed anyway 
 thanks for that much appreciated one problem with the runcorn list is that descriptions are already present so you have to think of something else to expand rather than repeat anyway dabombN seems happy enough with what i have done we await the others 
 yes i think you are probably right about the images in the list thats a case where i might be inclined to argue that alt text is unnecessary 
 if you have got a moment id like your thoughts on the above list the aim is to eventually take it to flc and was prompted by 
 you have taken on quite a challenge its a promising start and i have had some initial thoughts but id rather sleep on it and express them tomorrow 
 fair enough it gives me time to do a few more entries take as much time as you need it will certainly keep me busy for a while but seeing as most of the articles on uk world heritage sites are in a pretty poor condition i think a good list would be of use to the reader has stated that hes planning an overhaul of the lists but hasnt responded to my query about the format his plans take so im going to try and get there first 
 i think one list for the existing sites when i was working on the runcorn lists i was persuaded to combine the separate lists which was an improvement and apart from england the other countries make small lists im not sure about the british overseas territories do they belong here or in their regional lists and i guess that they will not all be british for ever are you going to have a separate tentative list in the article or list if it were done to the same standard as the main list it would give good information about the proposed candidates enjoy the task 
 as for the overseas territories unesco lists them under the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland so since its verifiable i suppose it should stay agree its not ideal though but i will just have to explain it in the lead i agree with you about the unesco reference column perhaps it could be solved by adding a key of some sort or a footnote explaining it one thing i intend to explain in the lead is the whole naturalartificial or mixed sites issue i was originally thinking of colour coding the table to indicate which was which but i dont like that idea so i could explain in the lead which sites are natural or mixed as the vast majority are artificial i will be making a separate table within the same page for the tentative list although getting information for it may be less easy 
 sounds good i agree that colour coding would not work 
 why did you revert my edit to 
 i have reverted your revert please give a legitimate reason if you revert my edit again 
 another nice article i have been through the lead and made a few minor alterations but i do have one further suggestion i think the lead would have a better balance if the first two paragraphs were swapped around in other words deal with douglass architecture right up frontuN which is after all the subject of the articleuN and then where he was born trained practised and so on 
 thanks again for prompt attention i have switched the first two paras as suggested does this work better 
 i think that looks great now hits the spot exactly good luck with the flc 
 i too think the list is good fingers crossed that flc isnt too problematic i have got the page on my watchlist in case the situation starts getting tricky so you wont be alone my only suggestion for the list is that in the last paragraph it might be worth explaining what a listed building is and that some of douglas works have been deemed historically and architecturally important enough to warrant protection at the moment an american reader might wonder what the final grade column means 
 i dont know boo about this ip beyond that its the ambient free hotspot at my fav restaurant now on ani riskers calling it an open proxy 
 and she intends to block it in an hour 
 then you have an hour to create an account and ask for the ip to only blocked from editing anonymously and creating new accounts 
 at which point the community intends to ban him for one year for violating his arbcom restriction to edit from jack merridew only 
 surely arbcom and the community will let him edit from one other account given that jack merridew is borked 
 looks like the community is intent on enforcing the current restrictions and are going to ban him for not editing from jack merridew in accordance with them 
 blocked for a year as an open proxy 
 and unblocked just as fast due to confusion over whether or not its an open proxy 
 i have noticed you have added center tags to two navigational boxes that i have edited now is the text not centered in your browser i only ask because the text in tables that use the navbox class should be centered automatically 
 nope its half way between left aligned and centre aligned 
 ah i think thats because of and the div tags 
 by the way what browser are you using 
 internet explorer 
 yes id be glad to though it may be a day or two until i get to it 
 thanks thats fine no rush 
 glad to help the difference between underlinking and overlinking is somewhat subjective i think it would be helpful to link the ones i have suggested but other editors might disagree about some of them when it comes to debating links at fac or elsewhere im inclined to give way on any about which i dont feel strongly 
 thanks for your note i am away most of next week so i fitted the wpgan quickly on the basis that it would be finished by this sunday the wpgan is not on hold so there is no ticking clock if it is finish by this sunday i can conclude the review if it is not then i will not be looking at it until the following weekend i will come to chester fairly soon i used to charge up and down the mN or mN between birmingham and salford but i never got any nearer to chester than natwich crewe and middlewich 
 i hope the expansion goes well prose grammer and references are ok im just considering scope 
 i do like the new text that you have added i have still got six weeks leave to take before the end of the calender year so i might make chester this year and if so can see the rows myself now that you have described them in detail in wikipedia 
 well done another article thats a credit to cheshire and its unique history 
 thanks folks i almost enjoyed that one 
 elkman i was looking into the situation that you posted at and im a little concerned im not sure why this ip was blocked for sockpuppetry in the first place editing while not logged in is specifically allowed by the meta privacy policy has this person been blocked over a content dispute im also concerned about which doesnt seem oriented toward smoothing over a dispute also could you specify the harrassment and trolling you cited when you protected the talk page 
 also i should get a clue about 
 what on earth or you doing are you trying to prove some sort of point blocking yourself in this manner will make people think you are crazy and could quite possibly lead to you losing your admin bit 
 im not sure i see the humor in calling someone a cunt and i dont recall reading something in 
 according to 
 trampikey just for future you can warn about external links using and the other user warning templates in the uwspam series the guideline about fansites is at 
 thanks 
 hi amos i was wondering why you inserted user blocked message isnt that something an admin would do just wondering 
 yes 
 i wish i understood what your goal was for wikipedia and why its so important to you that its worth sacrificing the newbies who get in the way of it maybe you can help me understand maybe we can talk things through before the next time you go behind my back to undo what im doing 
 replied at 
 congratulations on getting the article fl status its well deserved and the issues raised over naming etc in the flc should make it easier for any future flcs of the douglas lists 
 thanks it wasnt too bad in the end how did you know i am planning to get the other douglas lists up there too sometime cheers 
 are you considering a 
 in time but there are three more lists to do plenty of work yet 
 i dont know u and u dont know me how rude are you to say im a beggar its like a stranger tells you you are ugly mind ur own business if you have any because i have no time and dont want to waste time for losers 
 trampikey i think its up to hotwiki to decide what he does with his time on wikipedia if he wants to ask for barnstars we should let him if he wants to ignore what people say thats up to him hes a good editor so leave him alone and mdash 
 im just expressing an opinion about how annoying it is for someone to beg for barnstars thats all 
 uN really sorry i didnt do a review as i said i would i had prepared some comments at home which i was going to add tonight but i see it has been promoted i was doing a big church list of my own and forgetting to go to wpflc as nev says a featured topic would be good to go for especially given that mr douglas himself is already fastatus 
 not to worry it made it ok so in the event didnt need your support nevN has imo raised the standard of fls and the rest of us now have to do a pretty good job to emulate him ft maybe some time in the future best wishes 
 i have had a good look through now peter good luck with the flc 
 many thanks once again for your good work i thought hard and long about your removal of roman i was going to argue for its retention on the grounds that this is a listarticle on architecture and that any other considerations notwithstanding it depends on its sources for its content titles etc my four local buildings of england books all use roman catholic as a norm images of england is inconsistent but more pages use roman than omit it certainly in the liverpool and manchester churches then i looked at the ioe pages for this list both omit roman although the third c church was listed too late for ioe and the halton borough council booklet does use roman in its title so on balance i have decided to leave it out cheers 
 as an ex catholic myself i have habitually called it roman catholicism but after following something of the renaming discussion 
 i had a look at this article when i was thinking about it and i also looked at 
 could you explain the rationale for speedy deletion of this article when there was a hangon vote in the afd claiming that the article was under construction 
 i am not the author of the page i was merely reading through afd when i saw a speedied closure i noticed that the hangonstyle comment was added from a anonymous ip edit i reasonably came to the conclusion that the author was a new editor who probably does not have the grasp of policy that you or i have 
 when fixing double redirects dont just blank the outer one you need edit it to point it to the final target unless you think its inappropriate in which case it needs to be nominated at 
 sorry confused 
 oh dear thats your chances at rfa gone to hell in a bucket oppose clearly has no understanding of redirect guidelines and protocols suggest you come back in three months by which time i will hopefully have found another daft reason to oppose you 
 am i missing something bots take care of double redirects and have done for a while 
 if anyone opposes an rfa over this i will personally trout them anyway i left an educational message because a lot of people doing heavy article dev dont necessarily know all the technical details which is the way it should be anyway if this was a simple mistake then dont sweat it 
 gigs no sweat thanks for the initial message malleus knows that i have no intention of submitting myself to rfa i am a simple article writer who knows very little about technical details but i am always willing to learn thanks to everyone for their interest 
 why did you revert my change to 
 no but it is already mentioned in bold on the next line so there was no need to add it in again 
 i didnt add it again i just cut and paste it next to the real nameplus it doesnt sound right to add it at the start of the introduction as to when he arrived 
 as you can see you added it in when it was already there i treated this as duplicate information and removed it 
 hey does any ee article have anything about the turpin road or bridge street market i had a look but couldnt see anything on the lists where do you think it would be appropriate to add some info on it 
 i think it would probably be most appropriate on 
 thanks i didnt think to check there 
 have you thought about taking the article on peckforton castle to gan aside from one fairly inconsequential tag its a wellreferenced article and i cant imagine there being much more to add i just hadnt really looked at it properly since its not a medieval castle 
 its a thought but it needs some tidying up first and maybe some updating thanks for fixing the dead link looks a useful website the uncited material was added in march N by an editor who has contributed nothing else to wp i think it will have to go but i will have a look round to see if i can find any confirmation 
 thanks once again for your excellent improvements and advice 
 thanks for substing 
 no problem 
 also can i ask for a bit of help st anne hindsford was a N austin and paley church how do i link it to the article 
 sorry but i cannot find anything about st anne hindsford and i havent arrived at N yet can you give me any more details is there an article about the church 
 it was a bit of a struggle at times but i see you got there in the end congratulations 
 by the way what are your thoughts on the lancashire and cumbria project the project should exist but the creator seems to have backed off and a major potential contributor 
 so far as the lancashire and cumbria project is concerned im in at least two minds its very clear that some have bitten off far more than they could ever hope to chew but a little like you i think i want to spend time on topics that i find interesting for whatever reasonuN this is supposed to be a hobby after all not a job i was and am fascinated by the history of witchcraft hence i did 
 what connects me with the gm project is manchesters industrial and radical history which is poorly represented on wikipedia as is the history of witchcraft in cheshire now i come to think of it 
 hi sorry to butt in not sure if you have noticed but i left a comment on the article discussion page aregards 
 lol seems the article is getting more criticism kind of makes me wonder why we bother do you think i should scrap the grant one i was working on as i was gonna do it in a similar fashion 
 no dont let them get you down 
 i wont i just dont know if its worth extending it if we are just gonna be told to get rid of all the info 
 well we wont nominate it for ga then as long as we know we are doing a good job 
 by the way i think the person who passed ga said we should cut down the storylines if we wanted the article to be featured i think the reviewers of the phil mitchell article are being too strict and mdash 
 can i ask you something 
 sure go ahead 
 hi peter i believe you use firefox could you quickly check 
 it looks very good on firefox no problems that i can see one unrelated thought have you considered combining the notes and the refs columns so that the refs immediately follow the text this would provide more space in the notes column and reduce the white space i was persuaded to do this during one of my flc escapades and have been converted to it good luck with all the excellent work you are doing i do feel that heritage articles are going to be of much more value in the future of the encyclopedia than articles about the xth episode of some soap opera but thats just imho of course 
 great uN thanks for checking in the end i have had to remove a few because it looked strange in ieN on combining the refs with the notes i could be persuaded i did it that way on the first list i did 
 thats not far from the big house that douglas built for himself 
 hey can you check the accuracy of the ricky and bianca special i have included in her article i only pieced this together from reading various reviews on line but cant be sure if its right because i didnt pay much attention to it when it aired when r+b ran from the police were they bringing back the package of stolen money or doing a delivery for them 
 i have no idea sorry i cant remember it 
 you have just contradicted yourself and thus shown that you indeed are danhN the sentences danhN is not my account and you are correct on marking them but louN is another account that does not belong to me contradict each other as you are saying that i have marked accounts as sock puppets of you 
 there you go again 
 all of the sock puppet accounts of danhN including louN and munchN have vandalised 
 whatever i still dont believe you also if you vandalise again be sure that you will be warned and or or blocked as soon as i notice 
 well excuse me for thinking that but you have made one edit other than the ones to my talk page to 
 and like i said your edits occurred after the danhN ones so either you copied him or you are indeed a sock puppet of danhN 
 no you either copied him or you are him he vandalised those pages before you 
 ok if you are admitting that consider yourself reported i still believe that you are danhN but that is irrelevant if you are admitting to owning N vandalism accounts 
 note to any readers this is a vandal whose edits i have been reverting the above is also vandalism 
 you know you can just remove the vandalism from your talk page nobody would think you were vandalising just because a vandal said you were and mdash 
 i dont like removing things from talk pages though i like them to serve their purpose as an accurate archive of everything that has been discussed vandalism or not just my pickiness i guess 
 well just so you know vandalism should be removed from talk pages in general although its up to you what you leave on your user talk page and mdash 
 hi i put 
 thanks for your comments i have taken some of them into account in latest edits if you have further thoughts they would be appreciated and mdash 
 noi meant replace the image in the article ciao 
 oh thats great thanks for placing the free image into the article cheers 
 it seems that you have started half the articles on english castles and you have got beeston and halton up to ga so i was wondering what you thought of the main 
 cough beeston was one of my gas not every cheshire article is down to peter 
 good grief how on earth did i forget i only got to visit for the first time recently its an incredible place and there are some fantastic views it wasnt until then i realised how rubbish 
 thats right not me as malleus says beeston is his i cant remember contributing anything worthwhile (i have done 
 as a kid i wasnt too fussed about the castle when we went on family visits i was fascinated by the caves at the foot of the hill probably all sealed up now by the health and safety tsars i suppose 
 the first time i saw beeston it was a wow experience travelling on a train through the fairly flat countryside between crewe and chester it was suddenly there i took the job in chester and have lived in cheshire ever since 
 the castle that always gave me that wow factor was 
 well some houses in the city may have gardens and resemble a country house those are ok but not townhouses basically anything which is like a gentlemans residence in historical england they usually end in hall manor house or courtuN 
 one source of ideas is the list of gwr locomotive names there are 
 in this there was a loss of some info was that intentional 
 no loss of info did these minor edits in two parts the resulting N + character difference arise from consolidating a reference listed twice to once cited twice 
 could you have missed it perhaps 
 thanks there are many portraits in the town hall but they are not mentioned in the sources available to me i have added a sentence about maurys portrait thanks for the reference 
 i have contacted the blocking admin 
 in the blocking message its says please unblock surely you can 
 i will unblock i mus thave messed up the block i wanted to block anons only give me a sec 
 thanks 
 can you edit now 
 yep thanks 
 sorry about that 
 thats okay mistakes happen 
 it is a fansite please see 
 ah you confused me a bit there but i get it now i will get to tagging them now 
 re this dyk submission could you please cite the claim that the buildings were named after cecil parker i could not find any such statement in the existing ref 
 additional ref added which does clearly confirm the hook 
 who is beeblebrox i havent looked at the debate since you moved it from the village pump i thought i was wasting my time so decided to just get on with the referencing work i wanted to do 
 oh sorry i was commenting on the 
 sorry to seem fussy but increasingly wp seems to demand citations for every statement and these are supposed to come from reliable sources 
 so do you think quoting the memorial tablets in the church regarding the date of the clocks installation and upgrade qualifies as a reliable thirdparty published source the facts are published in a way though in stone not in print i have uploaded photos of the tablets in wikimedia commons and could link to those as verification of the source but i wouldnt like to link to them in a way that leads to their being visible in the article as i dont want to clutter it with random images 
 if sufficient information could be gathered imo the church is of such importance in cheshire to maybe merit a ga joining the churches at 
 if you have access to the history booklet may i suggest that you add a summary of it to the article the current history section needs expansion i have no idea about the norton priory theory i own the two standard works on norton priory and they do not mention it although one of them states that the fine tower of witton church was designed and built by the mason thomas hunter who is also thought to have built nortons cloisters if you get more info on the clock this would fit better in the history section the architecture section should imo deal mainly with what is currently present 
 i have summarised the history as best i understand it im hoping to contact one of the authors to ask him to read over it and correct any misapprehensions would an image gallery be a useful addition 
 this is an automated notice by 
 because it was vandalism 
 it is a nonencyclopedic 
 i reverted an ip edit i presumed to be vandalism also i presume you mean cant you add up in which case i find that offensive especially coming from someone who cant spell a lot or cant 
 i used the information already on the page to add up the totals so dont blame me i undid it as i thought it was a coronation street biased vandal i admit i was wrong to undo it without checking the contributions of the ip contibutor but i am not deserving of your rudeness 
 it was irrelevant to the article 
 irrelevant thats what trivia is its the kind of trivia thats all over doctor who episode recaps including this one hows it less relevant than the prince and the showgirl or new york new york in the previous episode do you just get off on arbitrarily undoing peoples work 
 the so good they named it twice is relevant because the episode referred to it the coincidence of a line of dialogue being the name of an obscure song is not a cultural reference it is just a coincidence 
 when this episode was in production the dreamgirls film was pretty big getting major international award nominations and wins and the subject of a lot of pop culture chatter especially jennifer hudson the singer of the song in question martha hit the long title of the song exactly she addressed it to the doctor who she has a crush on and the song is addressed to someone whos rebuffing effies love plus this episode has musical theater as a theme the episode was written by a woman and look at marthas face shes amused when she delivers the line if you choose to think of it as a coincidence thats your right i think theres sufficient enough reason to wonder for it to be an acceptable note whats the harm if you dont agree so what why not try making contributions instead of screwing around with other peoples input 
 dreamgirls wasnt that big in britain so why would they refer to it in a british show also what significance does it have that the episode was written by a woman i is just a coincidence hence the reason i removed it which isnt screwing around with other peoples input its cleaning up articles if everyone left other peoples input on wikipedia it would be vandalismridden 
 dreamgirls debuted at #N in the uk http or or wwwallocinecouk or article or fichearticle_gen_carticleN html i can find many more ukoriginated articles hyping it i threw in the fact that the episode was written by a woman so that i could laugh when you addressed the weakest argument i posed and ignored all the good ones its even funnier that you compare my note to vandalism trivia on doctor who episode pages are often speculative and theres easily enough reason to think a stupid little bit of trivia is worthy of note you are acting like this is a scholarly article and you are some kind of authority its trivia on a tv show and you are a selfimportant bully 
 the fact that you are finding this funny somewhat makes this argument less valid also calling me a bully is neither a good way to put across a point or verifiable im fed up of arguing over a coincidence in a television show now 
 my god kid the daily show and the colbert report to name two of millions of examples is regularily an hour of funny valid arguments and observations i will admit i was hasty to call you a bully per se but you removed a trivia addition because its your opinion that its just a coincidence and then you followed it up by refusing to address any of my arguments why you cant be so sure or any of my haverifiable demonstrations that you have made new dubious statements have you ever considered that you might be a N yearold who doesnt know everything and should be more careful about removing contributions that just may have been made by someone who knows something you dont im just saying its bad form to cut something like trivia which is commonly speculative to some degree on the basis that its something you dont know a lot about if you knew more about dreamgirls you wouldnt have been so quick to say evolution of the daleks couldnt have referenced it 
 i dont aprreciate being called kid or my personal information being refered to it is disrespectful as i have been an editor of wikipedia for N years with over N contributions and i know how wikipedia works so i know what should be cut and what shouldnt trivia is not commonly speculative and if it is it shouldnt be in articles which is why i removed your contribution if i had seen any others like it i would have removed them also 
 anyway you are an experienced and accomplished wikipedia editor but not infallable your scope of knowledge demonstrably doesnt include dreamgirls it appears to be unwritten but my experience as a wikipedia reader is that in common practice theres less of a burden of verifiability on fictional subjects and especially in trivia which is always more for fun than hard information you really cant hold an encyclopedia that differs so fundamentally from classical encyclopedias as to include pop culture fiction up to the same standards of schollarly stuffy integrity and verifiable facts not in the pop culture fictional articles anyhow im arguing that the dreamgirls reference is verifiable enough though i cant source someone like russel t davies or freema agyeman confirming it and that if you knew about dreamgirls you wouldnt be so skeptical i dont know are you being served so i wouldnt remove the reference thats now listed in evolution of the dalekss cultural notes it may be verifiable but not by me and so i leave it its verifiable that the signature song of dreamgirls has the title and i am telling you im not going that martha hit the long title exactly that the episode has musical theater as an element that the subject of the song relates to martha and the doctor and that the movie was big in britain during and right before the episodes production trivia thats this verifiable is all over the doctor who episode articles and i believe that when you have seen them you have passed them by because your scope of knowledge included the subject and you accepted it and you didnt this time because you are not familiar with the reference source and maybe those days you werent on a formalist tear and holding wikipedias articles on fictional entertainment to classical encyclopedic standards 
 the only doctor who episode article to which i have contributed is evolution of the daleks and the references to popular culture on there are all verifiable beyond coincidence two of the bullet points are actual songs that can be heard in the episode the lift or elevator point is languagerelated and the the prince and the showgirl and are you being served references are i agree speculative but again are verifiable beyond a coincidental line of dialogue being the title of a song in film that was big at the time of production of the episode whereas are you being served and the prince and the showgirl are older productions that have had a substantial effect on popular culture throughout time i dont doubt that dreamgirls has had some effect on popular culture but i just dont believe it to be enough to merit a mention in doctor who especially if it was big at the time of production 
 martha simply said that laszlo and tallulah were the pig and the showgirl and the doctor laughed and repeated the pig and the showgirl the only thing it leaves you to go on is if you have personal knowledge where the fragment term and the showgirl comes up prominently somewhere in popular culture i agree that this is almost certainly what they were thinking of but this pop cultural and partial phrasal example is the only semiverifiable source one can use to demonstrate that this is probably what they meant as far as i know i can list many possible reasons for the probability that martha made a dreamgirls reference including pop cultural exact phrasal character storytelling and thematic reasons and examples surely the number of reasons makes my note stronger i dont think that the fact that the other other productions are old reduces the probability that my noted reference was intentional pop culture impact can endure but current culture can certainly be more in the forefront of the mind of its observers but if it came down to a choice between citing a current and more obscure source vs a classic and more famous source to cite the same reference id put my faith more in the latter but thats not what this comes down to they are seperate references thanks very much for a detailed response though 
 what were you thinking of doing i can make you a family tree the branning or jackson and mitchell family trees are already on wikipedia somewhere 
 thanks thats much better i have added a few tweaks im personally not very keen on galleries i have created a subcat for the church in commons and added your photos to it and made a commonscat link to it in the article are there any other photos that could be added the plaques would not imo add much to the article itself but other photos of the exterior or of the interior may add value to the article or even the sundial the article is now much improved imo 
 the commonscat link looks much neater than a gallery though i suppose it might be less eyecatching for people who dont use wikipedia much so on commons i hope to add an interior the clock mechanism the bells an interesting roof boss if i can get a decent shot a corbel and a window perhaps the bit of surviving prereformation stonework now set up behind the lady altar though its only twelve empty niches and a green man of course because people like them i will also do a closeup of the sundial though someones had the gnomon im afraid i doubt if i can improve on the exterior shot especially at this rather bleak time of year but i will give it a go 
 sounds great some of these images could well illustrate the article this rather bleak time of year can be one of the best for photographing churches if the suns out because the leaves are off the trees good luck 
 i have added some photos on commons would you take a look and indicate which would be useful to refer to in the article 
 i really like your humor subpage especially since you included message from my talk page i admit that message made me laugh too 
 thanks you are the first nonegeorgiegibbons user to like that page i will continue to keep up the good work stalking talk pages and other things 
 anyway i would like to here your thoughts on the matter thanks 
 thanks for finding this i do not fully understand the uk copyright laws but as a free equivalent is available i think it would be tricky to substitute this i suggest we stick with what we have until a truly free image is available otherwise we run into unnecessary problems at gan cheers 
 frodsham norley cheshire frodsham small part of norley 
 sorry thats an advertisement from an estate agent and therefore not a reliable source its misleading and its wrong 
 the point i am showing you is that after the location was changed i looked myself at the location and was happy that the location was correct which it was the estate agent link is for you not as a reliable citation to allow you to perhaps realize that the area is the exact same location 
 sorry again but i happen to live near frodsham and norley and i can assure you that frodsham is much larger than norley and that they are separate communities thats not a reliable source but an ordnance survey map is these will show you that frodsham is a very large village or small town while norley is little more than a hamlet and they are separated by about N miles all the reliable sources say barlows birthplace was frodsham and thats how it has to be 
 yes i can see from your history now you are from there i was just a bit peeved to have checked the alteration and for someone not from there to have felt the norley edit to be fine and to be reverted i see now you are correct excuse me regards 
 thanks for that message glad we are both in agreement i made the changes because a new editor had altered the articles on 
 cj i read your excellent work on this article and agree with you on its quality if you wanted to explicitly support its promotion to fa status you probably should do so by putting a support on the left margin after your comments where it will not be missed you of course can support oppose or simply comment i read your comments as an implicit support but it would be better to make it explicit if you believe it meets fac criteria regards 
 hello i just wanted to introduce myself and let you know i am glad to be reviewing the article 
 i am pleased to say your ga review was 
 im not going to make a fuss about it but i dont believe that this article should have been passed as a ga 
 fair enough i should be grateful for your comments towards its improvement and i did invite you to have a look before i submitted it 
 hey i just noticed that you reverted a users contribution on this article because no episode aired on this day i havent seen the episode to confirm whether it was used or not but an episode did air on this date apparently just thought i should let you know 
 ah ok i will revert myself 
 hiya trampikey i have noticed your edits to various casualty or holby city or blue articles and wondered whether youd like to set up with me a 
 oh god the first one she appeared in as they are by first appearance 
 hi peter this is a difficult one any specific wording will be very longwinded having thought about it for a while i have only come up with 
 thanks theres no rush plenty of work to do before its ready 
 happy new year peter and thanks for your note despite giving it more thought i havent come up with any more feasible or elegant titles than the above structures would sound slightly better but works would be consistent with the lead and wording on other lists so 
 i know you are something of an architecture enthusiast i just wondered if youd be willing and able to take a quick look at 
 thanks for contacting me im certainly no expert on architecture my interest in the subject just sort of growed working on a previously awful article on 
 please dont articles which are listed here if they are checked and some action is taken they can be marked with some version of but it helps if they stay on the list as a record in case for example articles are recreated later with enough changes to fool a bot but which still may be a copyright violation 
 ah my bad i thought they would be removed once cleared up sorry for that 
 i was wondering do you think we should do a novel section in the pauline article we can describe it in an oou way then remove it from the background section of the storylines this will reduce the word count a bit im finding it hard to reduce now and it has already been butchered beyond recognition 
 leave it up to me i can see you are stressed with the bloody article so i will do it 
 thanks 
 no problems 
 btw good luck for any exams you have this week 
 thanks i should be asleep but i drank coffee so i cant lol 
 me either my friend dragged me to an after hours club called fire in vauxhall at about N am yesterday i was drinking red bull to stay awake and now i cant sleep i really like what you did with the article such a good idea putting that in the lead wish id thought of that 
 i have just tried to cut some down by using connectives and cutting out some bits that dont really need to be there but we are scraping the bottom of the barrell for stuff we can remove now 
 i know its puny in comparrison we are on about N words by my calculation wait and see what she says probably not good enough seeing as its not the magic N lol 
 right i have removed all i think i can lets see what elonka says about it now 
 hi i see that you have written articles about churches i wondered if youd look at 
 thank you for taking so much trouble i have a bit of work to do then and thank you for the advice i will heed it i think tyldesley is in the liverpool and southwest lancashire volume of pevsner because the leigh ecclesiastical parish was in the west derby hundred i might be wrong and it wouldnt be the first time i do hope you will make the odd edits i dont mind being corrected just want to see good articles and im glad you liked the picture im not the most confident editor i seem to be surrounded by real experts at the gm project so encouragement from someone like yourself is very welcome 
 i ought to say i havent been intimidated by the gm editors they seem to be very tolerant of me especially mf who could not have helped me more but theres so much to live up to and i dont understand anything technical whatsoever ( 
 i have taken up your suggestions and expanded what i had found the ref for early english found another photograph so it definately has improved a bit would you be kind enough to provide a link to some of your ga church articles there are so few around 
 thank you again for going to so much trouble i do hope you didnt think i thought it finished i do prefer the infobox you suggested so it is already in there i have found a pevsner ref online pN but the quote it is archaeologically careful seems rather odd to me architecturally would have made more sense but what do i know i will keep plodding on by the way you said that church articles were easy im not so sure 
 hello again i noticed you were working on waterloo churches i do hope i havent sidetracked you when i was working on 
 thanks for that yes i have come across it i have started to compile a list of commissioners churches but with N + its a bit daunting keep me going for a few months between other things its in a sandbox 
 well erm thanlks for that i have moved it to the bottom of my talk page where it is supposed to go and removed the huge unneccessary lines accross the page other than that i have nothing to say but the fact that you diversionary tactics are hilarious 
 i have added some more pictures to commons would you like to see if any should be referred to from the article thanks 
 thanks for this peter will read advice pages and try to implement yes will take church exterior on brighter day 
 how very hilarious for you 
 well its obvious you are diverting the attention because you cannot argue with my valid points which i find funny 
 yes i will check on that and help you out btw just as a headsup the 
 thank you havery much for the apology it means a lot to me and shows considerable maturity on your part that you are willing to reconsider your actions like that i look forward to having you as an ally on the soaps pages 
 most of my current efforts are going into building up and just making very minor corrections to wikipedia 
 hi thanks for noticing the two different versions of the article coexisted and attempting to merge them no small task im sure however i have noted that the latest article naming seems to be wrong according to the normal convention and have explained the rationale in the context of wp on the talk page of 
 thanks for the message i agree that the debate should take place in a more open forum and will reply there together with a message on 
 ps the list part of the article has not permanently disappeared i am working on a more comprehensive and detailed list 
 ps im korean so im not good at english wikipedia you should recognize that 
 using the phrase dumb ass to describe someone is not rectification of anything it is vandalism and not being good at english is no excuse either i suggest you read 
 lady tara has married sean reynolds offscreen and is now known as tara reynolds ithout the title of lady please do not change this again it was mentioned onscreen by eric pollard 
 she was credited at the end of the episodes as tara thornfield also she never said her name was reynolds eric just presumed i wont change it until i hear back with your response 
 hey there im not sure if you are aware but there is a process here that allows editors to request that a featured article that they have worked on be displayed on wikipedias main page as todays featured article i noticed that the N th birthday of 
 thats a nice thought id played with the idea of going for N may N the centenary of his death but why not N i must say that i have not come to grips with the scoring system for tfa but perhaps i will go for N as you suggest it that happens to miss out i will have another chance next year yes a reminder for the time for eligibility for nomination would be most welcome many thanks for your suggestion 
 no problem 
 you are now good to go for nominating at 
 many thanks for that especially for preparing the blurb i have made the nomination and should be grateful if you could check i have done everything properly 
 hi peter i have added a note saying all of the references use it as a title ie the cross bath but id be happy for it to be moved to 
 i have replied on the talk page suggest you move it if you are happy cheers 
 tis done and mdash 
 thanks i feel better now 
 hi i have created a page 
 i see that now it is correct 
 hello peter can you help identify a piece of carved stone lying outside the church of st helen witton i have just uploaded the image on wikimedia commons and categorized it but it doesnt yet display the file is called lumpjpg currently it appears at the address http or or commonswikimediaorg or wiki or filelumpjpg any ideas as to what it may have been or any informed guesswork would be welcome 
 hi i dont know for certain but i would guess that it is part of a carved coffin lid have a look at the image (it comes from the article on 
 spot on i couldnt find a reference in the standard church history but a pamphlet written cN records it as having been found in N before where the high altar would have been when the stone was moved the body beneath was in vestments carrying a silver penny in one hand and a hazel wand in the other sad to say nothing was preserved and even the stone was broken 
 thanks its good to get something right cheers 
 thanks for amending your comment at the pauline fowler fa nom just as a formatting point when you cross out one comment its good form to put your changed comment immediately underneath it to keep the entire thread together otherwise it looks like you are crossing out your support meaning that you are opposed to the nom the reviewing admin will see the crossout first and may not notice that you posted a different vote further down on the page just fyi 
 hey when you get the chance can you put in separate refs for the hugh miller book in the pauline article they pedants are asking for a separate one for each page 
 done how pedantic was that request though 
 it was a perfectly justified request and mdash 
 it was indeed 
 hi thanks for your message and for the very useful list which you are constructing i believe that pevsner has the details so i will check that later tonight and get back to you 
 the church isnt covered by the west riding pevsner and the modern sheffield pevsner has only the barest of mentions noting on page N that it was a commissioners church and has been demolished j edward vickers the ancient suburbs of sheffield describes it on page N as destroyed by enemy bombing during world war ii i believe that this is a slight exaggeration but that it was rendered unusable by bombing during the 
 hi peter hope you are well i see john douglas looks set for a main page appearance on N th april uN good stuff i used to do a lot of work with 
 hello great to hear from you im an admirer of your work to include a spoken version in the john douglas article would be a fantastic addition please go ahead if you have the time interesting what you say about paley and austin i compiled the lists from prices book slim but i thought comprehensive but maybe not on the website you mentioned i found for westham and for willingdon both are wellreferenced and i see no reason not to accept them as reliable i will add them to the list and should be most grateful for your photographs regarding commissioners churches yes again any photos would be most welcome the londonish content is far from complete and i have ordered the standard work on the churches from the public library but whether i get it or not remains to be seen i must say i have not searched assiduously for photos in commons and geograph but i am sure anything you take will be superior best wishes 
 westham and willingdon pics added just now the weather was rather mixed yesterday and for some reason the light was appalling even in the middle of the day so i had to tweak the brightness i spent most of the day getting photos of eastbournes current and explaces of worship for the next edition of list of places of worship in this is the last easy small district left the other six are so big they will keep me busy for a very long time next weekend looks good for producing the spoken version of john douglas by the way 
 hi peter uN the 
 thats terrific thanks a million it still looks promising for the main page on the N th 
 yes the welsh names were a bit of a challengeuN 
 trampikey it is considered quite 
 i dont think its needed it was added without discussion and what other image is going to be in the infobox than one of the character its just common sense that the image is of the article subject and a caption is not needed 
 see 
 actually i was going to add the caption the other day but forgot about it the reason i was going to do this is mainly because of 
 hi there 
 side comment can you clean up that article a bit stuff like we played their music and you decided well thats a big no really isnt the tone we want from a neutral encyclopedia article we should be unbiased and not that talkative its even better to be boring and stuffy than seem like an ad for the show 
 thanks for looking into it i honestly know almost nothing about the subject of the article itself just found it on random article and i heard on the radio about the removed materials i will try to wiki it up a bit though you are right about it needing more work thanks for the hints on the templates im still learning the ropes on how and when those things are useful 
 graciella is familiar with the process but shes been editing since N given that the fact that she once wrote the same sentence that ivan kricancic did is not conclusive but in any case that isnt really the issue is it its a content dispute so let me give you the same advice i gave graciella discuss and reach a compromise look at it this way even lets pretend that you are both diehard pov warriors each with a dozen sock puppet accounts say we block one or both of you indefinitely a week or a month later you will come back as another user and resume the same war with just enough differences that its not immediately obvious does that get anywhere surely not instead reach a compromise where you disagree each of you cite a reliable source and write the controversy something like this experienced journalist mrs qwerty of abcd news organization reported that N people were involved while highly respected professor ghjkl of efgh university wrote that N people were involved there that gets both of your points of view across in a way that both sides can hopefully live with and actually makes the article more comprehensive then you can both go off and find something else to edit rather than keeping writing about how the other person should be blocked all the time thats what the wikipedia is for after all writing articles not trying to get other people blocked all the time 
 please do not fall into love with me emir ok seriously it is clearly to me that you start to be obsessed with some people and it looks to me that you cant stand up that there are more people who does not think like you and who tried to provide complete sources try to communicate try to provide sources behind your editing instead of showing disrespect because im start to thinking that it is only what you know anyway one things come in my mind from your post above is he told you that he gave a source but he didnt tell you that he removed earlier part of the article which contained more complete information can you please explain to me how is more complete informations without any sources more complete than informations with sourcesinteresting i will be glad to continue talking and discuss with you on my discussion page or wherever you want of course only condition is that you start to show respect to me thanks 
 excuse me anonemouse for bother you again and taking your time but emir simple continue with accuse everybody who does not agree with himhe gonna to start again with someone else who does not think as he againplease take a look and he have again found another sockpuppet it looks to me that it will be very difficult to cooperate with this guy in future even if he decide to discuss with me 
 uhoh hold on there graciella dont try to cure all the problems in the world at once as far as i understand from the logs you have never edited that article and neither that editor nor the alleged sock master is you right one thing at a time please can you try to solve the first problem before going to look for new ones 
 sureit have nothing to do with me but just would to show you that he continue with simple same tactic as before reverting accusing and stay away from any blocking because of dynamical ip address and give trouble to other registered member it is not right in my opinion to be hidden behind dynamical ip address and accusing other people and how to talk with him when he simple ignore to talk and instead of talking start with accusing im still waiting on his next stepsat least i have give to be open for discussionstill nothing 
 unfortunately sage continueas i expected he continue with reverting ignore to take part into discussion page and he ignore my calls for talking everywhere and simple continue with his old and tested tactics revert ignore everything and then probably accusingi would like to request you to help in this case thanks 
 best wishes 
 just a query on your first point i was aware that by using qualifiers i might run foul of reviewers but so far as i can remember each qualifier is taken directly from the source and it is not for me to be more definite than the sources in your opinion would it be better in each occasion to say something like x consider that 
 i think its probably necessary to say who thought it possible as in x considers that or similar 
 i think the way you have done it is fine id probably say to any twits as you have here that the qualification is given by the source which is of course cited and the precise evidence can be found there pace malleus i think that we might end up with too many x thinks that it is likely which would break up the flow of the prose if we did it at every occurence though we could do it at points where specific objections are raised i hope your singing went well best wishes sophia 
 fac can be a fickle place im just pointing out potential hotspots in advance 
 dont i know it i have had enough for today thanks to you both i will continue the contest tomorrow keep the hotspots coming the concert was fantastic the experience of a lifetime (didnt see either of you there or did you not want an autograph 
 is there some reason why articles about dog characters should not be in the subcategory for characters instead of just reverting for no stated reason try explaining yourself 
 maybe youd like to discuss this on the relevant talk page as i am not the only editor who has reverted your changes 
 actually you are the only one who has removed these three articles from the category 
 so is your linking civil at me supposed to be a response to the question 
 as i have already stated i am not prepared to discuss this on my talk page and have commented on the relevant talk page where you rightly raised the issue i still find your general tone quite confrontive rude threatening and generally uncivil perhaps you should also read 
 thank you i have no need of your diagnosis of my mood or stress level nor am i responsible for how you are choosing to misinterpret my statements the notion of feeling threatened by a question on a talk page is bizarre 
 the fact is that i feel threatened and upset by your actions as i find your general tone very rude and dismissive the fact that someone can get away with being such a rude individual to many other editors is beyond me i still seriously suggest that you read 
 the fact is that im not responsible for whatever it is that is leading someone who lives in england to feel threatened by someone who lives on the other side of the atlantic ocean if you really feel threatened then you probably ought to take a break yourself because thats not a rational response 
 hi peter im not sure if you are interested in religion or just ecclesiastical buildings but if you look at the graphic article i uploaded there is a fair bit on page N and N about religion in manchester in the N s there are of course some nice architectural engravings in the article that may interest you too btw i saw something you were working on about churches in your sandbox i intend to get a better picture of stand church before too long as the one on commons is pretty awful 
 many thanks for contacting me im afraid that my interest in in the history and architecture of individual churches rather than in the broader subject of religion what you may have noticed in one of my sandboxes is work towards writing articles linked with 
 i didnt specify that i felt physically threatened but your irrational and extremely rude behaviour is intimidating N N june N 
 id also thank you not to bring my personal life into this 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised removing will stop the 
 no objection 
 thanks for that i needed a laugh 
 indeed well put anyway gotta go my celebrity dog needs a walk 
 the conversation is over and i have read your coments i will consider any further restoration of your comments to my talk page to be disruption and harassment and will take the appropriate steps to report it stop 
 trampi its okay let him have his talkpage hes actually allowed to do pretty much anything he wants to it including deleting warnings see 
 peter following our conversation on the project talk page i have found an alternative method of indicating articles that have been assessed i think it look much better but id appreciate your comments 
 yes thats much better my concern was that there was no way in which folk could be informed of the newly written articles in the project does this also incorporate substantially expanded articles too thanks for the trouble you have taken and for letting me know peter 
 it doesnt incorporate expanded articles as its a bot and i think it only looks at new articles for expanded articles it depends on what is wanted if its solely to advertise that something has been expanded we could put a section on the project page for that if its for reassessment then a not on the projecyt talk page it best so that someone sees it and conducts a reassessment 
 why was this deleted less than half an hour after id started writing the article i was probably reading up on info and how to edit the page when it got nominated and i was right in thinking there wasnt any point in writing more if some guys just gonna delete it asap i mean heck several pages in wikipedia link to the page witchcraft so its not like i was spouting nonsense about a band down the road that has about three relatives as fans 
 let me know if you have any other questions 
 i mean all i was doing with the article was starting it so that more people could add to it im not an expert on witchcraft but i did want to see an article so i started one and felt kinda annoyed when it was deleted before id finished 
 alright have you checked 
 from looking at what links here they are with an important indie label and they have had two albums and like i said the article hadnt been finished yet you expect a new article to have all the info up straight away 
 i have restored the article to allow time for expansion 
 thanks i have filled out the article a bit more including the two albums that they have released i really couldnt find much info about them so i couldnt write much without making stuff up but is it fine at the moment 
 you may want to look at 
 theres no reason to link to your personal site or your myspace keith coogan or the person who says he is has a myspace and mentions wanting to be in the remake there so add a link to that if anything but from all the effort you have put in its clear that you are mainly trying to get hits to your own sites 
 hi you reverted my removal of the notable roles in the 
 thanks for your message however i feel that if the field in an infobox can be filled it should 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our 
 if its just something you have heard it cant be counted as accurate unless you can cite a source for it 
 hey welcome back 
 thanks it was weird i couldnt view websites at all and now i can bloody computers 
 that happened to me once it was something to do with a registry error you can get that from spyware and also when you uninstall programs files get left behind and it slows your pc and fuxs it up my boyfriend downlaoded this for me its free and fixes all registry problems it also cleans temp memory from your pc which takes up huge amount of space if you use the registry cleaner make sure you save a back up of your current registry settings when prmopted just in case you also might wanna try this free spyware thing thats really good 
 whatevers happened my whole itunes library has been wiped depressing 
 thats very strange i suggest trying system restore which is under system tools in widows accessories menu you will probably have numerous store points from before the crash sometimes they go back every day for years and your music files may come back when you revert otherwise there is a way to copy all your music off of your ipod back onto you pc apple tries to stop people doing this for copyright reasons but all you need to do is expose the hidden music files on the ipod but when you initially plug in you ipod to ur pc make sure that you stop itunes from updating or syncing it if you dont it will wipe your ipod too heres a guide 
 hi kevin this is a friendly reminder that declining cases based on the fact that you feel they are 
 whoops sorry for that by the way is tims script down 
 i do not use the script so i do not know sorry 
 its alright i will ask him later then 
 i just wanted to take a moment to compliment you on your http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or fileanishinaabeanishinini_mappng did you make that in ms paint nice hehe also in general great job adding to all the wi and mn knowledge here 
 yes that was an ms paint image from years ago before i got esri arcgis at work i should revisit my notes on how i drew that image and recreate it in a crisper version using gis maybe even in vector image instead of as a raster image 
 im just asking 
 the siblings didnt legally adopt them the parents did so legally only the parents are related to them 
 im hoping to suggest some other complete lists which havent yet been featured i was thinking particularly of your three scheduled monuments lists and 
 sorry to be tardy responding i have started the lists section at the portal now so its easier to see what might work and what might not on consideration i think perhaps the douglas lists might work best grouped into two items ecclesiastical (
 just back from holiday im happy with all your suggestions i never thought about the scheduled monuments as fls i think that when i wrote them i did not know that fls even existed maybe sometime in the future meanwhile intending to work on 
 ok now added two blurbs as described i will take a look at the current version of 
 now commented sorry i should have raised some of these points during the peer review i hadnt realised how much the article had changed since i last read it although theres a long list of comments most are fairly minor and only a few require extra information so hopefully you should be able to address them easily the most difficult might be the plans i wondered about including this but i think it would significantly improve the articles comprehensibility cheers 
 re the nantwich list in the short term i had in mind inclusion on the portal but i have been meaning to see whether the list could be improved for the fl criteria for some time i have tried using the geolocation template before but couldnt make it work probably because as a 
 aha i seem to have got it working in my sandbox a combination of starting with grs and then switching to coordinates must have caused cache problems in my previous assays 
 coordinates are easypeasy if you use 
 i was thinking of using the grs on the english heritage site and then converting using the geohack link i dont understand the accuracy comment im afraid 
 sorry i suppose its what you are used to its just that by using earth tools you can focus down on to the centre of the building and then get a pointer that goes to the precise spot its so easy you dont need grs and conversions have a look at my lists if you are interested its saved me hours of time and its quite fun too cheers 
 hi id like to try and get some discussion started over at 
 hi peter i have added some notes to the discussion there as i am about to embark on similar lists for brighton and hove id be interested to see your responses cheers 
 sorry i know nothing about him nor of any connection with norton priory 
 i certainly hope thats true it was the church open day yesterday and i spent a lot of it loudly informing people the tower was built by the noted mason thomas hunter who did work at norton priory 
 pevsner says about great budworth it is so similar to the tower at northwich that the same mason thomas hunter may be assumed reference {{citation or last pevsner or first nikolaus or authorlink nikolaus pevsner or coauthors 
 thanks peter i feel vindicated as great budworth was the mother church of witton it makes sense they would both use the same mason wonder who he was never know i suppose 
 best wishes 
 thanks thats great good to hear from you im optimistic please improve anything that needs improving 
 i have emailed you a draft plan for the N th c priory let me know what you think 
 ok i have now done the prefire plan and am about to start tidying and then labelling what parts do you want labelled i propose just to use capital letters for ease of translation 
 i have uploaded a version at commons for your comments 
 i didnt notice that what did dot and charlie say about her and mdash 
 dot said she was on the bus with mrs patel and they had to stand the whole way i loved mrs p and shes havery popular in fan forums and some people have emailed ee to try and get her back as a regular so its looking good if they are mentioning her 
 wow thats brilliant i loved her too and i hope she does come back and mdash 
 according to someone claiming to be 
 this has now been confirmed at digital spy 
 i didnt realise mrs patel appeared twice have you got her first appearance uploaded on youtube as well i love how digital spy is using your youtube video on their site 
 i dont have the first one no i love it too one of my videos was in inside soap magazine as well 
 whats the ds link and mdash 
 never mind you have already provided it and mdash 
 that looks brilliant to me only comments uN congratulations and many thanks 
 thanks im glad its ok i have made a very minor amendment to the labelling which was inconsistent and added it to the article note if you change the legend significantly you should also change the commons description cheers 
 i have commented on most of your comments i dont know why the article is getting so little attention from the fac regulars its a bit worrying 
 more responses added hope these are now ok i suspect the review is getting so little attention because they are waiting for your conclusions 
 done thanks for all the editing i do think this version is improved 
 and am i the first to offer my congratulations excellent job 
 you are the first and thanks for the challenging suggestions and support another fa for cheshire 
 by all means you call the shots thanks for notifying me though i will be sure to watch that in the future when considering submitting aiv reports have a nice day 
 indeed that does help i see you recently got the mop congrats 
 thanks for the note i know about the tags and used them for the first of the socks that were removing tags after that the rest of them got blatant vandal warnings im pretty sure id handle it the exact same way next time 
 and the page has been recreated againany chance you can salt 
 which one did they use in inside soap i love that one you have done of all the character images with the wooowooowoo music 
 they did a feature about soaps on youtube and the sorted or going up west or awight one was in it 
 lol your youtube videos are notable how rude that they try to insult you for spending time putting all the clips together when it was actually taken from that N years bbc or ukgold programme the fools 
 i know and i had clearly stated where it was taken from as well oh well i have a lot of affection for inside soap in comparison to those other rags soaplife and all about soap 
 i need to get broadband so i can look at youtube more often ( and mdash 
 hello trampikey i was going to contact you earlier about this but i certainly need to contact you now about this the 
 cite it with a decent source then it can be added 
 i usually look up images of england when finding listed buildings but i came across this which although it has no images does have a lot of other stuff im going to use it to try and make one of those lists you are so good at i realise you probably already knew about it but thought it worth a mention just in case you didnt 
 no i wasnt aware of this site so many thanks for letting me know about it the problem with images of england is that it is frozen at N and has not been updated i have checked on runcorn and this site includes one building listed since N so it is more likely to be up to date the problems i have found at the moment is with wales to date i have not found an online site and this site does not give the grade scotland does have which i assume is up to date cheers 
 i have only looked at england but i like the way it much easier to search well its a start it seems to be an ongoing project hope it proves useful 
 maybe even better is 
 still no good uN 
 fixed 
 re wales i have recently found which has potential but more interestingly today i found which allows you to zoom in on the place of your choice in wales and see what information there is including the listed building information i have only just started trying to work out how to use it and it seems a bit userunfriendly at the moment however you can get to the full listed building reports for individual structures such as which matches the version i was sent electronically by cadw one hack seems to be that if you know the listed building number you can change the id at the end of the url which saves having to go through the map hope this helps 
 thanks that looks promising i will have a good explore of it when i have time cheers
 looks at though between all those sites listed buildings is pretty well covered now 
 i will not be engaging further on the matter of the ward redirects 
 i continue to await your answer to question N and i await your answer to question N 
 cheers 
 i have already answered question N several times i will attempt to do so more clearly there was a walled garden of redirects over N related to this one burnside topic alone this is a common tactic practiced by disruptive accounts because they count on us not watching whats going on new article patrol only picks up newlycreated articles so what they do is while they have the chance they sneak a bunch of redirects in under the radar they get blocked the articles done under their own account get nuked but they have quietly set up the situation where rather than creating a new article and getting detected they can edit an existing one into a page given that we are dealing with a hardcore serial offender with about N years experience and about N detected accounts and a history of highly combative editing blatant blp violations and even physical threats to one wikimedians place of employment i am not going to give them an inch i have watchlisted the articles i decided to keep i have deleted all of the redirects without exception and as far as possible have blocked all detectable accounts which the checkuser people hadnt already blocked they will be back and trying to do more im just ensuring by doing what i have done that it gets picked up quickly by the people running automated checks meaning that notoftenhere australian users dont get landed with some massive problem or god forbid we start getting legal threats from burnside councillors or staff via otrs if you are not getting it at this point i may deliberately have picked a less controversial or inflammatory deletion reason with an awareness of 
 oh and in reply to one point yes the city of burnside page is the best place to document wards especially if the page is heading towards b or ga or fa standard a discussion of present wards and some history from published sources makes for an interesting addition to the primary topic 
 thanks for perservering with this cheers 
 in response to the last bit i sometimes wonder myself and it probably explains the decreased number of active admins and the almost complete decline in people putting themselves forward for rfa nowadays i nominated at a much easier time in wps history in N my state project was the place to be around N active users constant activity new topics appearing out of nowhere reasonably frequent meetups now almost everyone has either retired cut back their activity or still edits but not on wa topics aus politics used to be a hive of activity its one of the few places where there still is activity but its pretty much five people im hoping that my sharing of sources will help that project at least oh and i really got my eyes opened when i got access to otrs which is like wikipedias back of house email system where people write in and make confidential requests while many of them are rejected due to not being actionable things i have seen some incredibly sad and disturbing examples there of how this thing we all do for a hobby intrudes on peoples real lives also what id call examples of organised sockpuppetry which exceed anything that was going on when i became an admin in sophistication much of it related to the scientology area although less active than i was i keep my bit for the same reason i nominated basically to help out where i can i apologise for my testiness in earlier correspondence that too comes down to human factors im tired im stressed and im busy mostly for reasons entirely unrelated to wp and i seem to have ended up helping at a time when i had the time and energy and being asked to account for that help at a time when i dont im waiting for an email back before i respond to the original questions although i must admit i dont understand the need for an answer to them 
 fyi i have decided i need to go on wikibreak until the end of the month or i will never get the familys income tax returns done in time talk to you next month cheers 
 woo hoo finished last night N days before the deadline 
 may i ask what the issue is regarding post ga development id rather fix it now than see major structural changes during the fac process 
 its not so much an issue 
 thanks peter i will have a look at the ga version compare and contrast and see what i think 
 if its the same character then she must have been played by a different actress in N if she definitely only appeared in N then the actress is one of these three victoria willing alexandra gonzalez victoria gonzalez im assuming that the gonzalez girls are twins who played baby chloe this website has a pic of v willing is that sue miller 
 i have no idea i just went with what walford web said i will try and find out 
 i know you are a bit busy with fac at the moment but could i run this past you given your expertise in the field im trying to write articles about all the listed churches on anglesey with the aim of getting at least some gas and an fl out of it i know its a bit further out than john douglas tended to work so im not competing with you for territory at least if and when you have a moment would you mind taking a look and let me know how i could improve them 
 thank you for your kind words my fuller reply is on my talk page to keep the comments together since i have asked a few people to take a look re pageview stats for dyk 
 hth 
 actually i think otherwise you end up in scotland 
 this was virtually all copyvio carry out your earlier merge proposal and just add it to cree language turning the article into a redirect 
 sure sounds good thanks 
 good wish i was a bit closer to minnesota for the wiknic 
 catch a plane the wiknic is right by the airport 
 i have had a go at creating a list listed buildings in rivington to be exact it has made my eyes water but that apart would you cast your eye over it its at 
 sorry for butting in peters format for this kind of article is great i agree the lead seems a bit muddled to me though the article is about listed buildings in the area but we are variously confused by the village or the civil parish and even given a population number i think the lead needs to focus on the buildings not on the area 
 ditto on the apologies but listed buildings lists are something i have been looking at recently (and i have something in 
 note i have copied both of these messages to 
 thank you when you have a minute can you take another peek please i replied on my page i havent done it all yet 
 also is there a way to tell the lonelypages tool that you want all articles in subcategories of a category thank you 
 i have tried the subcat thing before im sure it can be done but i keep running into memory issues in php when recursing subcats if i did do it itd have to be in a stored procedure and it would be very slow 
 anyway just a suggestion to consider sometime if it isnt too difficult thanks 
 thanks for the ideas articles with no talk pages or no template links on their talk pages would be easy enough and maybe theres some categories we could use to build a list of project templates lets keep this on the back burner until we get the project on track 
 now you are edit warring i frequently welcome new editors and have no association with him he certainly has a point though all his works were created in britain and are displayed in britain he took british citizenship served with the british army was granted knighthood by the queen and is buried in london how important is his birthplace that it needs to go in the first sentence also the eb article i quoted identifies him as british 
 id avoid the edit warring charge 
 my edits are in complete good faith and you freshacconci accused me of edit warring after two reverts modernist has also made two reverts so your support of him is only due to your biases 
 no my support is based on the nature of modernists edit reverting a questionable edit you appear to be getting annoyed that several editors disagree with you and so you are not even bothering with the discussion and just going ahead with editing this demonstrates badfaith editing you ignore 
 an or i is certainly not the right venue for a content dispute surely you know that 
 actually it is if you read through the options for mediation requests for comment etc it would be better to take your concerns there if you do not wish to follow the discussion and consensusbuilding procedure rather than editwarring or reverting without discussion and consensus 
 on talk i responded with this quote from the article although epsteins work was highly original for its time its influence on the younger generation of sculptors such as henry moore and barbara hepworth may have been limited as much of epsteins work was not on public display but in a few private collections mainly in the united states 
 for a userbox you can add to your userbox page see 
 thats very kind of you dont know what i have done to deserve it other than enjoy myself best wishes to you and yours 
 hi 
 the same reason that we have a trouting category albeit a bit more akwardly worded 
 i recall that you wrote that you were working on 
 thanks thats fascinating the old waterhouse hall was so vast i guess there are parts of it all over the country if not all over the world i dont think i will add it to the article though can you imagine a reviewer uN bits of an old hall in a demolished bungalow so what but i think id better nominate the article for ga now i had been expecting a bit more action on 
 lamberton is a genuine local historian hes the coauthor of lost houses in nantwich for example which i happen to have on my desk at the moment but you are right that in the context of the current article it would be overly detailed to include i will try to find a moment to review the eaton hall article soon not to mention getting back to support norton priory (im putting a lot of effort into my 
 i have no doubt that lamberton is ok im very impressed by the way the nantwich list is progressing i guess you will nominate it for fl when it is ready just a suggestion when one of my lists was undergoing flc i was asked why the refs had a separate column so i deleted the column and added the refs after the text in the description column imo it looks much better and reduces the amount of white space in the table in addition i think you will have to add alt text to the photos as well as rollover text keep going 
 i had consolidating the references in with the comments down on my list of tbds and i agree it does look a lot better like that do fls really need alt text i thought that was currently on hiatus im trying to screw myself up to convert all the web references to citation or citeweb format but keep putting it off also i know i have got to do something to make the dates sort properly do you have any handle on how many articles you need to create for this kind of list i know all the grade ii need doing but im assuming i can get away without doing anything like all the grade iis the dratted thing seems never ending 
 you have added a commissioners church category to this from what i can see the commissioners churches were funded by parliament whereas all the sources i have consulted in writing the article say that the funding for holy trinity was raised locally can you add your source for it being a commissioners church please 
 delighted i have added the information plus details of the contractors as a separate paragraph so that it doesnt interfere with the inline citations the info is taken from the standard work on commissioners churches which in an appendix provides a full list of all the churches receiving grants with details of their amounts i should like to add such details to all commissioners churches but as there were over N of them it would be quite a task cheers 
 great thanks for the addition very interesting it is too 
 hi have you seen 
 thats a bit of a ramble but its parallel to the debate on categorisation just as the title english gothic architecture is maybe a nonsense so might be the category of that name i would be comfortable with the tree architecture architecture by style gothic architecture gothic architecture in england this would nicely parallel architecture architecture by style gothic revival architecture gothic revival architecture in england which seems to work i hope that is a bit helpful 
 yes id never seen the article before and to me gothic architecture in england is the better approach i think in at least the early days they often brought in french masons anyway the category discussion will i think need to be restaged somewhere the debate really is whether buildings should be grouped in categories rather than just architecture at the moment the two trees are mostly entirely separate and we dont have a scheme that links up all eg gothic churches actually not so much an issue in england as there are so few other medieval buildings or say baroque houses 
 and mdash 
 points answered above i will copy the discussion on the talk page to the wikiproject cheshire talk page as suggested below 
 you should probably highlight the first point on the 
 it struck me that if i was going to write lots of articles using the same basic structure and the same standard references itd be easier to have my own standard template that preloads when you start a page the way that eg creating an rfa for someone does so now i have 
 thats extremely generous of you and its a brilliant idea it is probably of less value to me now as i have completed more or less all the notable cheshire churches im avoiding boredom by flitting from subject to subject although most of my articles have been on churches i am interspersing these with such things as a current fac and a gac the churches i am currently tackling are grade and nbspi listed churches in cumbria the architectural works of the 
 thanks thats most helpful i have added the info to the article and will copy your reply to the articles talk page cheers 
 hey just letting you know i moved this from gt to ft i think i fix it in any place where it was incorrect first one i have promoted from one to another so it took a bit of time to know exactly what to fix 
 thanks a lot for that very grateful for the trouble you have taken 
 the article 
 thanks for your review which is much appreciated i am normally an avid user of infoboxes but in this case i had a problem uN see my comment on the articles talk page 
 hi peter i have noticed you have a heavy involvement in churches and wondered if you could help me on a small matter i have expanded 
 i like the article and i like the way you give the reference for the odnb uN i think i shall steal it cheers 
 well the sources state that catesby was protestant during the time he was married and that his son was baptised in a protestant church so i doubt a priest would have been involved i wondered if you had a subscription to some church service or other that let you access parish registers or something people who specialise in certain types of article usually end up with a wealth of sources secreted away 
 sorry no this would be one for family historians and im not in that field i usually do the architecture and a bit of church history if i can find it 
 excuse my interruption genealogy is my thing i think you might find what you want by searching here whether it could be used as a reference i dont know 
 that sounds more use than me but to go back to my speculation robert himself may have been a protestant but his parents were prominent roman catholics and they would have been responsible for his baptism so i think my guess is still valid 
 no no robert catesbys parents were catholic but robert married a protestant and their son also called robert was baptised in a protestant church its that church im trying to find 
 everybody had to be baptised in an anglican church catholics were usually baptised twice once in secret 
 i congratulate you again for trying so hard to get your N th edit i have in the N range currently just to tell you my username might change soon 
 congratulations for your N th edit from me too hope you have a good trip to 
 but you probably dont need all of that information see for example 
 many thanks for that i have done the first few refs and it seems to be working id looked at this site previously found it awkward to search and hadnt realised its advantages i think im converted now playing about with 
 another massachusetts question for you i was preparing to do a health section similar than virginias and i was wondering which if any hospitals should be specifically mentioned i was going to mention 
 yeah there are many places that you are missing besides mass general and boston medical we have cape cod hospital brigham and womens danauN farber cancer institute tufts medical center shriners hospitals for children and probably a couple of others which i cant think about at this time 
 okay i will check into it one of the issues is that its a bit like the college sections for states really only room for a couple of the largest public and private universities and then link to a full list on another page i will try to expand it a bit though thanks 
 hi just fyi i have started 
 thats looking very promising uN you are well on the way its good to see some of those old familiar buildings theres no need for any form of attribution so far as i know anything published on wikipedia is in the public domain and for someones work to be used by another is supposed to be a form of flattery i understand 
 ah thanks im never quite sure about the attribution thing oh by the way i believe you have the shrine of our lady of lourdes in one of your lists i cant seem to find a free to use photo of it online but hopefully will take a picture of it this week weather permitting 
 a photo of the shrine would be excellent uN both for the list and for its article 
 i had the same question as you about the username being inappropriete because of it looking like an email address i think it would be the best idea to ask a third opinion on someone who would be an expert on that department and not report the user to the 
 there was a policy cutoff point where email addresses as usernames were verboten i cant remember the date have to look through 
 i think some of the entries you have added for bristol on 
 sorry for my ignorance i was relying on was the official source is it wrong please feel free to correct any misdemeanour im sort of looking forward to working in this area sometime in the future cheers 
 i think it is the best source but their definition of bristol region is very broad if you you get lots of the same entries i believe the standard on wp is ceremonial counties and i think their bristol region may equate to 
 thanks i was just spending an evening trying to do something not very challenging maybe in preparation for future work it will matter more when i start compiling proper list and articles i have also found a cheshire church thats now in greater manchester 
 i just found one that id duplicated one of my own entries for somerset should these be alphabetical by church name or by place is this going to end up as one of your excellent sortable lists and mdash 
 i believe somerset is now complete i havent red linked those without articles but if you want to do that id be very happy to help with the article creation and mdash 
 looks good these massive lists can be a real challenge doing all the grade i listed buildings in all N districts of somerset took me about N months and mdash 
 while on the subject when i go live with the friends do you think i should combine the english and the welsh or keep them separate my own inclination is to keep them separate mainly for ease of reference when i come to the cct there will have to be separate lists anyway because there are far too many for one list thanks for your interest 
 i would also keep the friends list separate with appropriate titles and link via see also you could do a list for each county with similar templates and perahps combine them into one article as has been done with 
 im working on articles for the somerset ones in the list but am unsure how to name the tower of the church of st james near 
 the way i have done it is to write the article with the title of the full name of the church then you can give the history of the church if possible describe how it was what happened to it and what is now left my recent examples are 
 ok i will do it as 
 suggest you call it 
 my apologies 
 no worries it was my mistake id seen the edits and mistakenly thought them to be by one user when they were actually by two so i inadvertently wiped out a correct good faith edit by a regular user along with a wateringthewalledgarden edit by a sock 
 trampikey isnt around much lately the best place to discuss this is at 
 all the cct churches in somerset now have stub articles except the 
 thats good work although how long it will take me to get round to the list remains to be seen re the infobox i have tended to use infobox church for most of the articles i have written it usually provides more information and has a field for the grading the field for denomination is mandatory but as all cct churches are coe or anglican thats not a problem infobox historic site colour codes for grade but im not sure what happens if its not graded actually not all historic sites in the world are graded so i guess you could still use that infobox 
 hi i have uploaded some images of the 
 thanks for that i have added the image that seems to portray the carving to the best effect to the article and to the list if you get a better one it can always be replaced 
 i dont know if you noticed but an editor has altered nearly all the references you so kindly formatted im not sure what i should do any advice would be gratefully received 
 yes i had noticed and its on my to do list for today my understanding is that including the names of the publishers is mandatory but i have thought of a different way of doing that 
 dunnit do you think thats ok 
 that was very quick work it seems like a good idea to me but there again i know so little 
 but you learn so much every day you are nearly an expert if this proves to be acceptable on your list i will use it on mine too uN so much tidier 
 i try in fact i can be very trying 
 i might use it on mine too if it works with the flc people i have been watching both of your flcs have been thinking of commenting for a while but a little unsure since i havent really reviewed flcs before one minor thought i had about both though the website names in the references are in italics isnt this against 
 hi i was wondering if you could help because you seem to know about these sorts of things i started 
 it means blackpool was part of the larger older bispham parish as the population increased parishes were created out of larger parishes its nothing to do with civil parishes might help 
 thanks that link makes a lot of sense to me as i realise that blackpool was for a long time much smaller than other settlements around it so am i right to think that blackpool became a parish in N when its church was built but that civil parishes are completely different and were administrative areas created in N blackpool being unparished that would relate to the civil parishes created in N or N im still a bit confused but less so than before so thanks 
 ok no reading the bits about blackpool on that site are just making it worse sorry if im being completely stupid but would each new church built in the N th century have formed a parish of its own 
 probably its usually why a church was built 
 ok thanks 
 if you have any questions just leave a message on my talk page thanks again 
 the same applies to 
 please say you are back for good we desperately need you have you seen the state of the eastenders articles 
 dont worry you will soon get the hang of it again 
 good luck with your dyk the hook about being the first parish will be ok unless of course you find anything more interesting 
 thanks that does help i thought i knew about this sort of thing but its more complicated than i realised my sources have said that st johns was the first church in blackpool but i have found other sources mentioning other churches before N but they may not have been anglican so thats what i will be checking out next hopefully i will sort it out in time for a dyk i hate the part about thinking up a hook anyway thanks for your help it gradually becomes clearer 
 easy to use just make sure you put the right article name next time 
 seriously its really simple much better than copying and pasting an old rationale from another image 
 i dont know what to write for portion replaceabilty and purpose trampikey( 
 i always leave portion blank anyway replaceability is the no free equivalent is available or could be created bit and the purpose is the identifies the subject of the article or specifically illustrates a relevant point in the article bit maybe it wasnt as simple as i assumed for the optional section at the end i always put the the image is not used in a manner that would likely replace the original market role of the original copyrighted media bit in the description bit i always try to say who the character and actor is and in the source bit you should put the date of the episode you should try to do that anyway even if you dont use that template although the main thing is getting the article name in there somewhere which you do so it doesnt really matter if you dont want to use the template its just a suggestion really so feel free to ignore this 
 if you do insist of ignoring this template could you at least use the appropriate bits of text from the template the rationales we used to use are totally rubbish 
 thanks 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or you constantly help me with great civility and exemplary conduct this is a generic thanks for your ongoing help over years its a pleasure to know you 
 thank you and you too 
 first of all congratulations on the promotion of historic chapels trust you are a difficult act to follow thank you to for your edits to listed buildings in rivington i must pay more attention 
 thanks it turned out to be more complicated than i had thought uN but more lessons have been learned and the list is all the better for having gone through the process i think you have noticed that i have applied some of these lessons to the rivington list but even when you think you have the perfect list someone will find fault in it now you need some reviewers to come along they are being a bit slow with rivington my next venture is to do a companion to the the historic chapels with 
 its gone live 
 i dont like to leave a job halfdone so i have tackled both of the issues i raised above as ever if you dont like anything i have done you know what you can do revert it good luck at flc 
 are you in denial about tonights eastenders 
 no im just waiting for someone to write it up well it was good wasnt it trampikey( 
 theres not much you can say about it in her article really but then again nothing about jims illness is mentioned but yeah it was bloody great 
 im trying to sort out the plot on her article now trampikey( 
 see 
 i have been saying it has to win that award for a few weeks id be very shocked if it didnt win who hands out that particular award 
 the british soap awards nana moon won it in N or N trampikey( 
 zoe and kat won it too a twohander and a special episode dot is bound to win 
 hi peter just a quick query you mentioned that when doing a listed building article you need to include a coordinate location but im not sure how to get this can you help cheers mate 
 hello just butting in here im not sure if you mean how to go about getting the coordinates or how to put them in the article but if its the former you can get them from the british listed buildings website each building page has the coordinates as far as i know they are accurate but you can check them after you have inserted them into the article hope that helps 
 sorry for the delay in replying i have been away on grandparent duties there are all sorts of ways you can get coordinates belovedfreak has suggested one way for listed buildings normally i use its easy and accurate and can be used for any location from the home page use the jump to country box in the menu then select united kingdom then click on find places type in the name of the place then click on zoom and you are there or thereabouts then pan about under the hybrid link put the cross on the building then click on location and you get the coordinates is two formats and the grid reference and its good fun too good luck let me know if you get any problem a fantastic website imo 
 thanks both of you for the replies there both great websites so i better get started only N locations to go s 
 by the way i think we should mention somewhere that the closing credits were different to normal and used 
 i have mentioned it in the section about the episode on the twohanders article trampikey( 
 hi i saw you added the recent death template but didnt add any thing to support it have you got a citation i have googled and found only reports that it is delayed 
 no i just wrongly assumed that it had already happened my bad thanks for fixing that 
 your note acknowledged discussion continuing at the foot of french riviera discussion page 
 see latest note on fr discussion page under penultimate heading cote dazur timed at N today im holding out for that definition toulon or cassis hold no attraction 
 hi peter hope all is well i have just found by chance when googling uN some of the info could be useful for future listed buildings work on an unrelated note and bearing in mind some of your excellent recent lists i wonder if 
 yes all is well in the wet northwest thanks for the info about the leaflet could be useful as you say re cct i have to admit that i have already started see 
 and even more so now it may pass before you get back i found nothing amiss apart from a tiny tweak which i made myself so my support statement is now there as well good to see that cct work is underway already i can try and pick up the southern list at least i think there are about N sussex churches under cct care i have already written articles for two of them as part of the brighton and hove list but the others are rural ones over here in west sussex they are on my schedule of church articles to write anyway i may submit 
 is full bloodied a typo for full blooded in the friends website or am i missing something cheers 
 i think you are right so i have changed it 
 cool on an unrelated note where do you get all your oou sources from im trying to do an oou section for mo harris but dont know where to start looking trampikey( 
 this is a good free archive which has loads of old articles heres another its pay for access but it gives snippets so you may find something of use in a search google archive sometimes comes up with some good stuff otherwise its worthwhile searching through newspaper websites like the guardian sun and mirror daily mail etc putting in mo harris eastenders into the search bar and seeing if a review or interview comes up 
 thanks hows the admin thing going trampikey( 
 im writing you a summary now bigging up all your achievements its very complicated ive run you through wannabe kates tool to get your edit count and everything i dunno if im doing it right lol this may take some time 
 its really hard to answer the questions because i want to sound good but whatever you write cant be taken back as it will always be in the edit history they hated my answers on my last rfa so im really wary trampikey( 
 dont worry about it they can always ask you to elaborate you have matured in your outlook since then anyway and you know more about wiki in general anyway if it fails its not like it matters we can just nominate you again in a few months 
 N oppose already off to a great start and its because my talk page is riddled with 
 i am sometimes a bit ott sometimes even deliberately so 
 i thought you were no longer watching nevs rfa page if i were a user of your terms i would use them but lets get 
 ps i suppose you realise that you will have done yourself no favours by supporting nevN at his rfa now you are tarred with the brush of having supported a rude and uncivil editor which will likely be brought up against you at some time in your wikipedia career if you should ever trip up not that you should be bothered of course 
 ha ha what career i dont really care about wikipedia and its administrators what i care about is providing good and accurate information for future readers 
 i would appreciate you casting a very brief glance over 
 butting in i would think peter wouldnt mind you using his format at all i have used it for a few now hes a very generous editor 
 replied on sentas talk page 
 now read this 
 just fyi i have asked you a fallow up question to optional question number N take your time answering cheers 
 hi fisherjs i saw the wikiproject albums template you added to 
 thats the right template one template for all types so that the article ends up in 
 okay thanks 
 trampikey hi just my $N of advice its pretty obvious that the rfa isnt going to pass you might want to consider withdrawing and just closing it rather than putting yourself through this for another week or up to you though 
 thanks elonka i know it probably wont pass how would i go about it if i decided to withdraw trampikey( 
 pretty much the reverse of accepting go and cross out your i accept language with and tags and add a line that explains that you are choosing to withdraw at this time say as much in your edit summary as well also remove the listing from the main rfa page then either you or one of the clerks can go in and do the formal archiving a bit later and it will be over 
 well trampikey at least you know what to say for your next rfa blah blah blah communicate blah blah blah blah blah admins are never wrong blah blah hehe 
 lol yeah ugh trampikey( 
 dont know if you have seen but 
 thanks yes i spotted it yesterday feel very honoured 
 congratulations peter i shall look out for it 
 please do not remove messages that are reasonable 
 i have been out all day uN but glowing cheers 
 i have my doubts about this as a standalone article it seems that the only possible notable feature is the font uN and this may of course be moved a possibility might be to write an article on the ely team ministry with sections on each church and a link at the top of the sections relating to any separate article 
 hello trampikey i have closed 
 what acalamari said took me three tries myself 
 how do you mean could you explain the problem fully trampikey( 
 hi peter looks like a splendid job so far as ever im glad you have put it up for dyk the portal dyks could really do with anything that isnt in nantwich or chester i probably wont be able to spend any time on this until after the bankholiday weekend but de figueiredo and treuherz has several pages on tabley so i should be able to add some detail then 
 theres no rush i see that wetmans got involved i will have to check his edits later i have ordered a new scanner and written a stub on anthony devis a previous redlink have a good weekend 
 now for my special pleading which i dont mind you ignoring i used to live a couple of doors down from 
 the top of the bell tower if you want a dyk hook is also the highest point in cambridgeshire 
 hello simon thanks for the compliments at present apart from articles relating to my home county 
 i know you do a lot of excellent work on architecture i am likely to start a discussion about the category scheme for architectural information about buildings soon let me know if youd like to be directed to it 
 although i have written a lot of articles including details of architecture i must admit that i dont actually know much about it but have i learnt a bit and am still learning as i go anyway i should like to at least observe any discussion on categories even if i cannot contribute much to it 
 butting in here i think harvnb is great too just a little too much work for one of my articles at this moment in time on another related matter do either of you know of any good norman architecture images of peterborough cathedral for 
 comment for thegrappler the only quibble i have with the template is that for multiple authors it provides an ampersand rather than and wp seems to dislike ampersands (
 to be honest my reluctance to change 
 its an easy template to use as long as you do it from the start i generally use the template in most articles i put together now but id hate to convert the references in either 
 hijust a quick note you might find this article 
 thanks it looks like it covers a lot of the unknowns of wisconsin life 
 hi would you provide a brief note of support to these afd discussions listed 
 its not really notes of support that are wanted but rather improvements to the article this is about article rescue i have found an N source talking about the church in uttoxeter but since this predates the N rebuild i still lack a source that links what redfern documents to the modern building it might not be the right church 
 thank you for your support at the recent which led to the the nom withdrawing the afd 
 thanks for your message as it happens i was just preparing a message to you for your talk page the afd was nonsense anyway four separate churches on one afd without any good reason i feel a message to the nominator coming on maybe later today i fail to understand why people take such interest in deleting articles theres plenty of room in wikipedia and they dont delete articles which imo are rubbish like episodes of sitcomsi dont fully agree with uncle g notability is about notability not about the quality of the article uN thats a different matter an article may be short inadequate or whatever but if the subject is notable its notable and thats that imo there is no question that listed buildings by the very fact that they are recognised as notable by the official heritage organisation in england is enough uN and i think thats been accepted elsewhere on wp however i think we have to be careful with churches and other buildings that are not listed and if you write an article about one have some good argument up the sleeve to present in the case of an overenthusiastic deleter i can remember only one article i have written on an unlisted church 
 per 
 and that is of course the point the absolute best irrefutable argument is a good stub article with copious sources i have no idea how many article rescues i have done over the years but i have done several where i didnt comment in the afd discussion at all and simply made an entirely mute case by expanding and improving the article without mercy its not about acting like an old fogey and berating the younguns for nominating the obviously notable for deletion sometimes the oldsters conflate notability with personal preference and their personal likes and dislikes of a subject which is quite the wrong thing to be doing its about setting an example of how to write and about getting a good article at the end of the process witness 
 completely agree good wellreferenced new articles should escape noms for afd not blowing my own trumpet its a long time since i suffered an afd and never for a church article my gripe was about what appeared to be a knee jerk reaction uN and this sort of thing can cause considerable distress to a newbie and maybe lose a potential excellent editor before he has had time to settle in 
 i agree with both of the above in fact i demonstrably used both approaches to arescue these four churches my first reaction was to support the editor ( responding to the afd then asking peter for support in this thread i then counselled the editor to use a citing approach then i started adding sources myself here like peter i did feel the afd lacked substance and it did wind me up a little especially when i think that there may be more needlessly aggressive prods and afds occurring when such page patrol people come to bury editors not to praise them 
 did you cool peter see 
 and another one but this time a that someone else has picked up as an afd again a similar case where an inexperienced user just needs a little encouragement to seek sources in this case i cannot help but now i am getting wound up by picking on the weakinnocent i want to make it clear here i am not a new page patroller and frankly do not want to be as i can imagine the work is thankless yet still needs to be done i am very concerned however that there may be many new editors being lost through this prod or afd process on proto articles 
 its a problem as a penance or when im bored i will look through a few new articles the number of which is quite staggering the problem though is that the admin wanabees have to rack up as many csds and afds as they can as fast as they can to establish their credentials at rfa i on the other hand get diverted into investigating articles like 
 thanks to both for your messages im sort of cooler uN taking a few days break anyway as mf knows im on wp to write and improve articles and thats it i have zero interest in becoming an admin but i get upset by aggro towards others especially new and inexperienced editors i dont really like being drawn into disputes but sometimes you have to do a bit of duty and nbsp 
 does that include aggro directed towards novice editors who do new page patrol and #N 
 well as a novice editor myself i continue to try hard to though at the moment i fear i am becoming a oneman crusade against a certain pagepatroller shakes head smells the roses goes back to article creation 
 any aggro towards anyone 
 hi i deleted four pictures of yours about the stravinski fountain i can undelete them temporarily so you can transfer them here 
 drop me a message when you are done 
 im awfully sorry i completely forgot to answer you have to upload the picture here on wikipedia you can keep the license you originally chose you just add this template i will check afterwards whether everything is ok 
 wheres ap got to do you know hope hes ok 
 no i dont i havent been on msn either so i dont know if hes been on there trampikey( 
 its not like him is it he usually puts up a wikibreak notice if hes going to be away i hope its nothing serious but he probably just has pc problems or he got bored of wiki 
 i hope hes ok too i wouldnt blame him if he got bored though trampikey( 
 yeh me either i go through stages are you feeling bored too then its a thankless task editing wiki but at least you know you are appreciated by some 
 i think only you and me appreciate one another you are right we get no thanks for our hours of hard work but if you put a toe out of line or shock horror have an opinion you get flamed trampikey( 
 i know but i have decided that its because everyone else is just an egotistical wanka and i couldnt give a toss about pissing people off anymore in fact i quite like doing it haha look what i just saw which might cheer you up you have been called a legend so others appreciate you too 
 thats cool i was gonna reply to that discussion but i cant be arsed trampikey( 
 lol @ this was exactly what i thought 
 any news on ap im very worried about him now he could never leave the leona lewis article for so long 
 i dunno i havent heard from him trampikey( 
 hello i was wondering why do you keep reverting my edit to 
 we just dont use that on the eastenders articles we dont have ages in the infobox and isnt for real people not fictional characters trampikey( 
 anyhow please just explain your reversions instead of typing nn in the future less hassle then cheers 
 if you want to do a different kind of church for a change there are sources for 
 apologies for the delay i have been away you honour me by the invitation uN but i have recently embarked on a project dealing with redundant churches in uk and there are over N of them so it may be a while before i can offer much to usa sorry 
 thank you for your recent help and support it really has been most welcomed the process completed and i hope we now have a happy and more informed inexperienced user i really do apologise for apparently dragging you into a situation it is not worth the further effort we all could expend here 
 thanks for the message i remember a few unpleasant interactions in my early days and i do not see why people should have suffer such experiences in this project 
 what did they say you needed to do before they will make you an admin this annoyiong prat who keeps doing incorrect infobox edits is grating on me i think we definitely need to make you into an admin so you can protect the pages from people like that especially if ap is gone for good 
 i cant really be arsed with the whole process again maybe you should have a go this time trampikey( 
 no there would be a couple of people i can think of who would pounce on me with numerous diffs to stop me passing i refuse to give them the satisfaction 
 maybe i should apply to admin coaching before trying again i dont think a third failed attempt would make me happy saying that i applied to admin coaching after my first failed attempt still no response trampikey( 
 cant u just ask elonka she had a bit to say about it on your last attempt maybe shes willing to coach you though there wasnt much criticism about your conduct on here it was more about the answers you gave to their silly questions we just need to find good answers from past rfas and get some ideas for next time 
 hope that helps 
 nice to see that article added thanks 
 ditto from me hope you dont mind but i uploaded a photo from flickr that i think is better quality than the geograph one 
 if you are interested the flickr user i nabbed the picture from appears to have taken quite a lot of decent quality pictures of churches around the yorkshire area and i think they are all cc released link 
 thanks to both for the messages and especially the photo the one i used was awful but the only one i could find of the exterior on commons i have never really got the hang of the copyright rules about flickr the article is in fact part of a list im compliling of the churches preserved by the 
 flickr is very hit and miss as to what they have got whereas with geograph you know it will be released all i do is go to the and make sure all the creative commons options are ticked its pretty easy to upload from flickr with the tools available but let me know if i can be of help looking at that list one of holy trinity york and one of st andrews bywell the main benefit of flickr over geograph is that the resolution of the pictures is normally much better particularly if you download the original size 
 mainly about diane and janine even if its for an episode or two dont we usually readd their names to the cast based on their existing history with the show 
 they are guesting so should be treated as guest characters are trampikey( 
 you have been stuck at N for a while i was rooting for you to get to N 
 heh thanks rl dumped on me and i just got a little burned out doubt i will make it to N by tomorrow but thanks for the support 
 would you fancy applying your expert eye to the 
 you attribute to me skills which alas i do not have all my writing on churches and cathedrals is based on what sources i have or can find i dont have much knowledge or eye for detail but i am learning steadily i just wonder if a good option for you would be to involve 
 thanks for the ideas i had sent her a message first as she and i debated the failings of the article on its talk page about N years ago i will wait for her response but may try to tackle some of it myself and mdash 
 hi peter i know you are a busy man but i was wondering if you could take a quick look at 
 it looks pretty good to me and probably does not need much more attention this is not a full review but rather a few random thoughts i suggest you ask someone to copyedit the lead and text when they are more or less complete suggest you mention that most of the buildings are in the centre of the town before mentioning the outer ones it seems to make more sense to me and is the town really on the fylde coast some distance away i think a tiny point which would be brought up make the references come in number order uN this applies for example in the manor and to market cross no doubt other matters will come up when it is at flc they always do even if you think you have covered everything let me know when you submit it and i will follow its progress good luck 
 thanks for those thoughts im so used to hearing the fylde + coast i just put them together naturally but you are right i will let you know when i nominate cheers 
 interesting piece on redundant or ruined churches 
 no missed it which programme was that but i have been catching up with last weeks programme on civic architecture on bbcN much info on liverpools 
 ah well it was only a short bit in the end on countrywise in fact by the time i left this note it had become more about efforts to stop churches falling into ruin probably not worth chasing up on catchup but an interesting little interlude must be fun seeing topics you have worked on cropping up in the wider world i have not had that happen yet 
 in your comment on a proposal made by 
 personally i agree with most things that thatcher writes and would be happy to get a general statement from the arbcom on this except for one key point im not sufficiently confident that arbcom wont issue unjustified sanctions in this particular case given that fred bauder and flonight at least have strongly implied they would like to thats kind of an important point its like asking a us supreme court of presidential appointees to rule on a specific closely contested presidential election id be happy to trust them in setting general rules im just worried about the specific sanctions to be handed down on a case where they have already expressed bias 
 i no longer have a firm opinion whether they should take this case or not only on the scope of the case should they take it i dont think sanctions of any kind would be likely to arise from the case at present although i foresee guidance and the possibility of warnings and an admonishment or two i seriously doubt that jeffs persistence in renominating cases on deletion review until he gets his way would be regarded warmly 
 can you stop adding to the myth tony at no point do i show persistence in renominating cases in this particular dispute i listed a drv twice once to review the out of process closure in the second afd and once in a good faith attempt to avoid rfc and arbcom be honest and accurate 
 okay persistence in listing a deleted article for deletion review twice and trying to get arbitration committee to order people to discuss it again 
 yawn 
 we didnt on the ee ones but do what you want i couldnt care less about corrie trampikey( 
 the northern region looks fine on a quick scan let me know when you get to the southwest and i will try to help with that one and mdash 
 just a note to say thanks for the mammoth amount of work you have put in on the above i created the original stub when doing things with 
 thanks for your kind remarks i have made the addition you suggested its good to have this sort of feedback you sometimes wonder if you are working in a sort of oblivion so what someone sometime may benefit from what we are doing on wp cheers 
 are you planning to nominate at flc im working on sw england but there are loads of entries most of which dont have articles i would hope to have them all done in a month or two and would then do a sw list based on your formatting of the northern region and mdash 
 it is certainly in my mind to do so at some stage although im not in a rush what do you think of it so far i think the lead needs a bit more attention but i have been distracted by working on 
 she was mentioned when they first arrived wasnt she where was is established trampikey( 
 why have you reverted my edits on the 
 oops i now see i had undone an incorrect revision i accidenatally removed the award instead of the scripts all clear now 
 hi gossipking im just having a look now trampikey( 
 i dont think i have anything suitable sorry trampikey( 
 trampikey you have to watch this if you want a laugh 
 thats effing hilarious trampikey( 
 your hook for 
 thanks for fixing it 
 hasnt left yet see the talk page for him why did you undo my edit 
 your speculation on the talk page verifies nothing it was his last appearance get over it trampikey( 
 buenas a quxeN viene que quites la pxeN gina de derby andaluz oriental que habxeda puesto en la principal del mxeN laga saludos 
 se volverxeN hablar de aquello cuando vuelvan ya lo verxeN s saludos 
 please dont be so unpleasant also when he turns up again briefly remind me to say i told you so 
 fan and hate sites arent allowed see 
 peter as you may have spotted im slowly working my way through cct churches in wiltshire but could i ask you to take a look at 
 replied on rods talk page 
 thanks for your comment im continuing to work on it but im not familiar with the church infobox so could i ask you to apply it to the article as you are obviously expert in using it and mdash 
 thanks i have used the churches infobox whenever i have looked at lbo it has the same data as ioe and the need to register or login at heritage gateway or lbo rather than going straight to the particular entry can be a barrier for some what would you suggest as the dyk hoo i was thinking about the N levels of paint in the wall paintings and mdash 
 trampikey the reason they werent on the list is because i couldnt find valid sources calling them supercouples if you read that talk page it was clarified that all unsourced entries should remain off of the list i hope you find sources for those couplesas i couldnt 
 thats becuase supercouple is an american term not really used in britain trampikey( 
 thats a nice writeup at 
 im attempting to do so now we will see how long it lasts 
 thanks for your contributions at 
 no doubt tex is an art form i really wish wikipedia had better mathml support though its a horrible mess mixing up straight html math with wikis tex and rarrhtml converter with pngs but until they get on the ball we just have to muddle through to do all the commutative diagrams i use paul taylors along with john walkers perl script for converting the tex to pngs i believe the script makes use of the for doing the graphics conversions 
 thanks for the textogif link i didnt know about that and it looks really useful as for mathml perhaps theres an issue of browser support as well im using firefox which probably has as much support as any recent browser but then i havent seen any sites that make serious use of mathml so its hard to tell what state things are really at theres some talk about this at 
 in the interim i find the thing that looks best is to use straight html for everything thats typed inline and to use tex for displayed equations but i can also see the argument for using tex for everything that way if the developers ever get on the ball we wont have to rewrite all these pages in proper tex 
 to me these two bits of tex look identical after they are rendered can you explain the advantage of the latter format 
 i assume you are referring to the change i made to the 
 you are welcome thanks for the orginal its very useful 
 tex italicizes variables and i think the cursive lowercase l in tex looks better than the noncursive one partly because its less likely to be mistaken for the digit N of course it wont get mistaken for N in this case but theres something to be said for stylistic consistency and i think its esthetically better too any chance you could make the change in this graphic 
 yeah i think the script l looks better too i remember i had some trouble getting it to work in the picture if i get the chance i will see if i can play with it some more 
 peter can i pick your brains again im now doing cct churches in devon and working on 
 sorry about the delay in replying i have been away i havent been able to find a reliable source about this but to my understanding grades a b and c were used in the early days of listing for anglican churches and the grades equate respectively to i ii and ii some of the early gradings have been updated some have not i use the grade now given in heritage gateway in your case it would be b until this is updated i guess presumably at some time or another the a b c grades will be updated to i ii and ii but until then i prefer to use the specific grade given by the source cheers 
 you left a message for userN goodN be about inappropriate use its become my first delete as a copyvio 
 a question how long should a csd tagged article be left up before it is deleted i dont mean copyvios or blatant attacks or hoaxes but ones where as it stands it looks liable but where there could be a hangon 
 thanks for that thats about what i thought 
 that one is older than the other is more than i knew about great circle distance seems more accurate since its the length of an arc of a great circle and it gets more google hits so maybe i will move it back where is your information about the ages of the names coming from 
 i wasnt try to say one name was older than the other i just hadnt heard the phrase great circle distance before whereas spherical distance seems common i must admit i like the name spherical distance better it is very natural since it is just the distance function in 
 would you be kind enough to take a look at 
 its now up at 
 i will try to remember to add the comma between church and town later but a certain copyeditor seems to be in full flow at present and i dont want to cause edit conflicts and mdash 
 im not sure we can equate b with ii i have seen a b go to grade i i will email relevant individuals and organisations to ask if it has been regraded yet and mdash 
 just had an email back from english heritage church of st martin cathedral close exeter is still a b i have replied asking if we can equate this to ii and mdash 
 thanks for the note re cct and consecration i have amended the lead of the sw list and 
 hi could you tell me the license of 
 i made it myself its released under the do whatever you want with it no strings attached license 
 hi peter perhaps move this dyk nomination to the special 
 thanks for the idea i really do not have any strong feeling about this but i have added a note under the suggestion so that those who decide these things can make the decision 
 and i will tag them for you thanks so much 
 as with all other diagrams that i create this is in the public domain i usually forget to tag the files though sorry 
 re for what its worth i have added wp anglicanism to all the cct churches 
 thats fine thanks 
 i notice it currently doesnt have an

 hi fropuff i replied to your request from october on 
 i have uploaded a third picture which might help 
 please pleeease pleeease dont publish the fact that a church that is no longer in use has a piece of prerestoration silver in it if it is still located in the church then it probably wont be tomorrow 
 do you really think the silver is still there some chance anyway its already published elsewhere and the information is generally available and the article does say in the N s when the church was still in use and nbsp 
 so i live in austin too care to have a beer some night at dognduck or something like that 
 sure beer is my favorite food group send me an email sometime 
 yes i understand the difference between homotopy and homology the fundamental group is by definition the first homotopy group and piN in the case of the torus the first homotopy group is commutative for the simple reason that i have stated check any book on algebraic topology the first homology group is equal to the abelianization of the first homotopy group if the first homotopy group is already abelian then they are equal 
 you are absolutely right i should have checked some texbook 
 thanks shawn for getting in touch again i agree that there is a serious gap in the recent history of the building and i should be most pleased to be able to fill that however as i said to you in my message of october N all material must be 
 hi you and i have been doing some work on 
 i suppose there is always more to add although i think the stub message can certainly be dropped i had wanted to mention something about the orientation of the standard symplectic basis and mdash vs and mdash and also something about the relationship to 
 incredible synchronicity ciao 
 hi daubmir i will see if i can replace the deleted article with a stub 
 sorry i didnt respond earlier was looking at my own talk page duh i think adding a section on orientation and and one on complex structure will be good what about infinitedimensional examples the poisson bracket (maybe that belongs in 
 infinitedimensional examples would be good perhaps with some discussion of where these things appear the 
 hey fropuff i need to know how to make dynkin diagrams and i was wondering if you could tell me how you made the ones on the 
 i did the versions i uploaded in mathematica probably not the best way but it was the only tool i had i can send you the notebook if you want it 
 i just noticed your well written new article 
 thanks for pointing it out i meant to add some stuff to the 
 my main aim was to write on 
 hi thanks for adding the link algebra i always forget about this one btw i like your homepage ps you may have noticed that i also like your coordinate space 
 well i made those venn diagrams in a kinda klugey way i dont really have very good drawing tools available id be willing give it a try but i cant visualize how to represent the disjoint union with a venn diagram if you mean the union of say two disjoint sets then of course two filled in nonintersecting circles would work but for the general case of the disjoint union of say two possibly nondisjoint sets then i dont see how to represent that by the way thanks for your vote in support of my admin nomination 
 congrats on your successful rfa i have no doubt you will make a great admin 
 ding congrats 
 the article on english gothic still isnt very good i have neglected it for years and should get back to tidy it up i have been told that such oldfashioned grouping of styles is nolonger in however it makes life much easier if one has a few divisions and can sort buildings into boxes and stick an approximate date on them just by the style of their tracery 
 thanks for getting back again and for generously giving me all that information i was going to contact you again about this precise matter i was concerned about 
 i dont know if it was to you that i said this before but its best not to mention small movables like the church plate the trade in stolen church property is ongoing and just awful 
 are you sure that smile is the standard it is not what the book im reading uses also the name suggests cup i find those smiles really ugly but i guess that is beside the point 
 i have only ever seen smile used i do think cup should probably be reserved for unions 
 while copying article 
 at first glance im not sure why you have 
 part of the reason i wanted to write something up on the 
 cool list i like it is it supposed to be manes though maybe an obvious typo but i didnt want to correct in case i was missing something 
 yes of course an obvious typo thanks for spotting it maybe a slightly obscure subject but imo worthy of a place in wp 
 noticed that the paragraph about examples of discrete subgroups of lie groups was axed while recognizing the inadequacies of the paragraph i want there to be a further explanation of discrete subgroups of lie groups that being the primary way the terminology of discrete groups is used today for example g a margulis discrete subgroups of semisimple lie groups farkaskra riemann surfaces etc the closest i can find to this topic is a brief paragraph in 
 im a little confused i axed the statement because i thought it was a repetition of what was stated in the first paragraph a discrete subgroup h of a topological group g is a subgroup whose relative topology is the discrete one clearly a discrete subgroup of a topological group is a discrete group this covers the lie group case as well were you trying to say something more than this 
 hello thanks for the comment i did wonder about putting it forward for a christmas day dyk but im not quite sure how i would go about it should i put a note on the current entry or make another entry under december N by the way im a big fan of all of your church articles luckily i managed to get inside 
 haha yes the organist goes mental verse um i noticed that instruction as well so what i have done is left it in the original nomination place and then also duplicated it in the special holding area so at least then its up to one of the dyk bods i cant see why they wouldnt want christmas day themed nominations but i will have to see the list looks really good by the way i will have to have a proper read and will be supporting it 
 and so on perhaps including examples for which there are as yet no links 
 i think organizing the examples like that would be a great idea 
 okay i see your point i guess we will have to sacrifice some concreteness in the introduction in order to avoid misleading readers feel free to edit it as you see fit it would be very helpful to highlight the exact relationship between euclidean reflection groups and coexter groups somewhere article 
 so many churchesin the words of neo wow 
 many thanks uN and i have really only just started anyway it makes a change from pop songs and episodes from soap operas cheers 
 on a completely different subject thanks when you get tired of churches malleus thinks there arent enough articles on workhouses 
 i like how you have drafts in subfolders on your user page how do you do that 
 then click and edit like a normal page 
 im not going to even try to get into all the stuff above but i would like to say that the N vic election article is certainly awful and if you want any help on that one id be glad to oblige 
 thanks i think about N per cent of the content could go without any damage to the article certainly anything unverified or speculative and i was going to use the political chronicle to establish a baseline for the narrative and factiva to clarify the narrative where necessary i was also going to ask timeshift to look at the polling section as hes pretty good with making those and could bring it into line with other articles and its a section i have little interest in 
 you are not wrong theres a very large amount of rubbish on that page if it wasnt the election page it would almost be better to use the unsalvageable argument we used on the campaigns and start completely from scratch which i daresay is pretty much what it will take as a start i will sandbox some proper results tables (interestingly missing from the main article although there are some old ones on a rather dubious 
 page N of has the results tabulated the only thing missing being the seats held in both houses in N 
 as you wish although i dont think anyone here is out to discover your true identity even if they were i think you can maintain your anonymity just as well with a fake name it just makes it easier for us to interact at any rate i hope you enjoy wikipedia 
 i do plan to disover this anons identity use it make huge credit card debt in vegas strip bars and as a final touch publish it on the web under the 
 hi jaga what do you think about creating a tool that allows finding out the former use of a given image even if it was deleted i think the same method as in could be used showing some edits by the user after uploading the image 
 that sounds pretty straightforward but it will be a while before i can dig into it i have just moved from the us to the uk and everything is craaaazy but in a good way thanks for the suggestion 
 there is certainly no hurry all the best for your life in europe 
 i hope you had a good start in the uk might i dare asking if you are still planning to create such a tool 
 hi peter thanks no problem with any of it being used for the other areas if you want me to cast an eye over them in advance of flc let me know and mdash 
 hope those quick comments make sense if not let me know and mdash 
 the row and column scope stuff has been discussed in various places try 
 thanks for that i have tried to understand it but its all over my head so i will just follow the rules i have interspersed my replies to your comments above and malleus has done the copyediting already uN hes a good guy 
 im not sure what i meant about the sorting now either and i cant find any heritage gateway references without a date so i think all comments above dealt with the sorting by placename works for me im assuming marefair is a suburb of northampton but that may be unclear and it stands out from the others i cant spot anything else at present and mdash 
 marefair is a street or road or thoroughfare so its been deleted and i have added alt text for all the images to give it extra value 
 hey there i read on the wikiproject united states history page that you are knowledgeable in the american civil war well i need help proving that the battle of gettysburg was indeed a decisive victory for the union could you help me please reply on my talk page thanks 
 oh wow that was almost two years ago sure what do you need help in 
 well these images are all really simple they should probably just be simple line diagrams for the cone diagram it might be nice to show a cylinder with an arrow pointing to the cone which is the cylinder with one end collapsed to a point the base space x can just be a circle i dont know if this is making any sense or not 
 is this okay or ott 
 these are very nice images of cones but not suitable for the article on topological cones it is difficult to see the construction of a topological cone from these pictures as i said above i think a simple line diagram would work best 
 make one then come on fropuff it is really easy there is xfig on linux any vector drawing package would work just fine too like inkscape all you need to draw is several lines and maybe circle arcs easy matlab or maple would work too if you know how to use them easy 
 i have spent some time in the past looking for good programs and never found anything i like maybe i have missed some stuff 
 as oleg said have you tried 
 yes i used inkscape too very nice and easy to use free as in beer and easy to install i really love the way it draws splines you can draw a shape then it is very easy to finetune it and it does export to eps as far as i know 
 thanks i will give it a try 
 i like church and article a lot in addition to what i said on dyk could you please insert the term 
 thanks for the message i have made an addition to the 
 i have added 
 thats fine it was just to inform you i have now started on the final area the south east 
 this is getting closer one also has to label the base space x and the interval i i might try my own version with inkscape to see if i can get something nice i do have a copy of povray on my computer although i have never figured out how to use it 
 i replied on my talk page 
 i have already found the list useful if nothing else people can scan through it and create redirects or fix broken links as needed its also useful to see what redirects need to be made when creating a new article we should mention this page at 
 splitting up the page into too many pieces is going too far i would think splitting it into about four pieces would be enough dont you think and it should be set up so the pieces can be transcluded easily into a combined list for those who want the complete list on one page 
 i am doing this because the whenever i open 
 i understand that but we dont need twenty plus pages to solve that problem you just created one page that has only two names on it p an approximately equal four way split would look like af go pz semiactive and inactive 
 why are the section headings noincluded im trying to use transclusion so that you can view them all at once if you want at 
 i changed 
 i presume they are male deer prancing around uN the sort of thing masons seemed to enjoy carving at that time 
 i couldnt quite make sense of this frederick vyner the son of its owner was murdered by greek bandits in N and his mother used the money from his ransom to pay for it did his mother kidnap and ransom him if she didnt how did she make any money out of it 
 i see what you mean its an interesting story told i have tried to rephrase it a bit but i guess you can do it better cheers 
 presumably the remainder is the chancel 
 yes amended its good to have a separate pair of eyes overlooking things 
 hi fropuff i updated the redlinks pages this time i wrote a real useable script instead of a hack so the process is fully automated i can restart it at anytime with no work bug me again when you want those links refreshed 
 thanks oleg i think updating every couple of weeks or so would be more than sufficient 
 you seem to have pretty much become a one man cheshire project which shames me into remembering that id offered to try and do something with 
 i feel guilty about the cheshire project it has few active participants it used to be run by ddstretch but he is now abroad and unlikely to be able to resume work on it espresso addict took it over disappeared suddenly returned and has now disappeared suddenly again the trouble is im not really into all the necessary management stuff thats required to run it properly and i have got into those conserved churches the recent improvement of tabley house is a slight ease to the conscience and i have just bought the book so i really must improve some of the house articles to run the project would be for me a duty and i have had enough duty in my working life so i now want to enjoy what i do on wp and i like to think that what i do is of some value 
 theres no problem at all with approaching a ga reviewer you trust to take a look but i see from below that you dont need to do that anyway pyrotec is certainly a reviewer i trust 
 im tired of it im tired of dealing with the stupid vandal and im tired of dealing with you and fractyls constant additions to the live articles from now on there will no longer be any hidden content other than small editing notes just keep it somewhere else because we have no way of telling how long it will take for this shit to even make it to airuN 
 cool down i know you are irritaded by these vandals you have no idea how i feel about these annoying vandals so i suggest you do not complain to me because i cant put these back because of these stupid vandals ~ 
 also just as a reminder the content you have on 
 and why the hell not ~ 
 because i can never trust you to act in the proper way when it comes to writing articles from scratch there are always things that shouldnt be there or ways that you have written it that do not match the way wikipedia wants themuN 
 well then just tell me how to fix it or if you dont like it fix it your self its that simple ~ 
 no because i dont want you or fractyl to be writing up whole articles on your own subpages are not meant to be turned into whole articles all the time when the article is written some time in september it will be from scratch like every other page and your subpage will only be used as a place to copypaste katakana fromuN

 hi i have a request for this quaint parish church st nonna fantastic work on the churches uN 
 thanks for the compliment do you have a request for me to do something cheers 
 almost anything you can do can be undone but please take a look at 
 congrats 
 just read the novel 
 i read the novel some years ago but regret that i do not remember the details well as i still have many articles to write to fully populate the lists on preserved churches i fear i would not be able to get to nonna for some time and the articles i wrote on cheshire churches need improvement since i wrote them i have developed a better style and format at least nonna has a section in the altarnun article but if you wish to write a separate article im sure you would do an excellent job cheers 
 thanks i feel honored (first im a white sysop on a black background and then an orange sysop on a blue background all i want to know is when do i get my wikipedia 
 also congratulations from me im glad you came through the sometimes vitriolic process of rfa without too many bruises i do hope though that your work on the maths articles wont suffer too much 
 hi peter i have now signed up to this review as the ones of yours that i have done before have been good but it might be three or four day before i get round to it the new year apathy has not yet dissipated i signed up to do 
 no trouble at all its a good article i just dont seem to want to spend so much time on wikipedia fighting the bad parts but i do like to see good articles emerge 
 hi peter i know its not your first fl or fa but i didnt know your work before i stumbled on this by accident and i would like to offer my congratulations on your superb list i also have a particular interest in churches but the humble nascent church list that has been slumbering in my user space is not a patch on what you have achieved well done 
 thats very kind of you this is in fact my N th and nbspfl and they have been evolving from my first simpler attempts in the process i have been much helped by other editors with similar interests plus the flc reviewers who have been powerful with their suggestions and criticisms i think that what has evolved sets a sort of model for lists of this type the N th flc has been offered for consideration 
 hi there peter i see you are being very productive as usual i noticed that you are working on east of england churches and i was wondering if 
 hi beloved not at all in fact feel welcome you may have realised that before i submit 
 happy new year to you too i will have a look at the flc and try to help out with some eastern churches my time onwiki is a bit hit and miss at the moment and when i am here im finding it hard to get stuck into things still in holiday mode maybe need to start getting a grip of lancy churches too 
 i honestly dont think its a big deal but i changed it for you 
 could you please remove the annoying box that is centered on your userpage whenever i try to scroll its extremely bad web design thanks 
 i have just added a new entry for 
 i will try and follow up i have never heard of a hjelmslev transformation either although the article is clearly describing something related to the klein model 
 i have unleashed 
 thanks for the encouragement i forgot to say that i have been pottering about adding the church to the minimal 
 hi fropuff i have recently made some commutative diagrams (
 you might try a better conversion program i recommend its a perl script for converting tex source directly to a gif or png i believe the script makes use of the for doing the graphics conversions i usually run it with the options png dpi N res N i guess the only other factor is the package you use to do the diagrams themselves i have been using paul taylors whether or not it produces nicer results than xypic is a matter of opinion of course 
 im shuffling bits of this around at the moment to make it a lot more readable in a while i may get some better sources and hopefully take it to fac but im of the opinion that the whole trustees section is far too large and should be mostly placed in its own article what do you think 
 hope you dont mind me interrupting pod i have started but nowhere finished 
 i agree that the trustees section is too large in the context of the whole article if its going to fac what happened was that i borrowed the book about the trustees and added the material relevant to this article hoping that it would be useful i suppose i sort of hoped other editors would have material to expand other parts of the article to a similar degree of detail but if that is not available i guess the best thing at the moment would be to summarise what is there to bring it to fa suitability im not sure what to do with the rest of the material i no longer have the book and the owner is rather ill anyway for the sake of fac use what you choose 
 its a long way from fac right now but i just wanted to see what you thought i know you spent a long time writing that section and i didnt want to start moving things around without first consulting you what if we created 
 i really appreciate your getting in touch with me about this so far as the canal article is concerned please use the information in any way you choose in respect of an article on the bridgewater trustees its a good idea for the future the trouble is that i just used the material in the book only as it related to the canal as time went on the trustees very much expanded their interests and empire and this would have to be included in a comprehensive article good luck with working toward fac for the canal i will keep an eye on progress cheers 
 ok i will take a look at it in the next few weeks and see what i can trim i think a separate article is best 
 well i hope that answers your questions if you have any further questions do not hesistate to ask me on my talk page or ask the 
 ps you can also check out 
 that messed up the display of the rest of the template but the information that you entered was still there and once the ]] was removed it displayed nicely again if you have any questions feel free to ask im more than happy to help and thanks again 
 reN hours and still not seeing what im missing yeah been there done that dont want to do it again re image yeah i was confused at first myself but again all that was wrong was a small detail the wikipedia is very case sensitive except for the first letter and as such N nosejpg is different than N nosejpg anyways welcome again keep it up and your comments as to where youd like the nascar wikiproject to go is more than welcome even if it is just echoing what others have said 
 i dont use the search bar or enwporg ftw 
 it looks like you got it right though if the release of the image was made through contact with the rightsholder you will need to contact 
 i saw the quality of your contributions at dyk and clicked on over to your user page and was pretty impressed would you be interested in helping with the 
 im very honoured by the invitation but not at the present thanks 
 where did you get the brett bodine pic as said above it needs to be tagged with a copyright tag can i ask where you got it from 
 also i wanted to say you are a great writer and i enjoyed the 
 im not quite sure where i got that picture from i will substitute with another one where i know i got the source from thank you for your advice and kind words 
 i hope all this isnt discouraging you have done a lot of work in a short time i hope you have enjoyed learning more about how to contribute your help in creating wikipedia is highly valued 
 all right thanks for the update i will try to find new photos in place of the ones from sugar free racing thanks for your help 
 no problem a word of caution about N per cent of photographs you will find on the web are copyrighted and cant be used on wikipedia without a written agreement from the copyright holder to allow the photo to be published under the gfdl license the above links have more information about that if you have photos you have taken yourself those can be used if you agree to release them under the gfdl 
 congrats on your latest fl peter im sorry i never got around to reviewing my editing here of late has been a bit patchy im hoping to get more involved in reviewing at flc at some point no doubt i will be seeing another of your lists there soon enough 
 thanks for that it got through with three supports so that was fine the next list in the series is on the preserved churches in the east of england the biggest list with lots of articles still to write who would think theres so mush heritage around for a bit of variety im also working on a cheshire country house article hoping to bring that towards ga best wishes 
 i hear you i will delete all those images i will try to avoid loading images in the future 
 pardon me for intruding and durin correct me if im wrong but i dont think that durin was suggesting you not load images but copyrighted images truth be told almost every image is copyrighted unless explicitly stated otherwise some are not for example images created by the united states government images made by the 
 absolutely its ok to upload images theres a lot of images on wikipedia its not the images you uploaded that are the problem the problem is their copyright status please do upload images just make sure they are clear of any copyright concerns 
 if you were to ask my advice id say that the best thing to do is to start with 
 talkphroziac or talk]] N N september N 
 if you are talking about the cheerleading one i just reuploaded with a tag i have a question what should i assume if there is no copyright label on the webpage it is coming from 
 pictures are copyrighted with all rights reserved unless the author explicitly releases his rights please dont upload pictures you find on the web unless theres some reason to think they are free and dont upload pictures with the tag it is your responsibility to determine the copyright status before uploading 
 its all good fun 
 indeed i also end up writing little articles about some of these obscure early welsh saints eg 
 if substantial content is duplicated and it is not 
 heh again i fool the bots with a mirror site 
 hi ktrN could you give me a link to the nonmirror site at the moment i have blanked the article as a potential copyright infringment as there is no mention of any other site on the flagged one i can see a claim of copyright thanks 
 hey i was wondering if you have a source for this image if not it will have to be deleted soon 
 the site is however it is copyrighted so it looks like the image will have to be deleted irregardless thanks for your help though 
 nah what you can do is tag it at and explain that we cannot get freeuse nascar photos unless people like to take pictures for us 
 ga review in progress shouldnt be much to worry about a couple of minor comments or suggestions so far will see what else i can find 
 and now on hold pending a couple of minor prose suggestions for you or mf whoever gets there first to tell me that im wrong 
 i would never tell you that i wondered about gradeN listed building myself when i first came across the article it was gradeN listed building iirc while i could just about see a case for gradeN the double hyphenation just didnt seem right hyphens are there to resolve ambiguity as far as im concerned and i dont see any reasonable ambiguity in grade N listed building but of course its peters decision 
 well i do my best to learn from the best perhaps aspiring copyeditors on wp should have a little bracelet with 
 i hadnt seen that no quite humbling if im ever seen to be arguing in favour of aint being proper grammar or complaining that an article doesnt contain enough pop culture trivia then my account should be blocked on sight as its obviously been compromised 
 btw i like your bracelet idea seems very sensible to me lol 
 whether or not the website you got it from still exists has no influence on any copyrights could you tag it for deletion so it can be deleted without having to wait seven days thanks 
 that has been done thank you for your help 
 thanks theres no need for an ifd though if you are the creator and want it deleted you can just tag it for speedy deletion 
 well so that you you actually get something out of this i will give you the wikiproject ships barnstar if you can review yet another one of my current N gans these are for the wikicup and they can be viewed 
 i will do it 
 thanks leonard your a lifesaver 
 i have given two of them quick reviews i might do one of the other articles later depending on my time and whether someone else does them first 
 i have addressed everything for uN now on to the next one 
 i have replied at 
 if you need any help dont hesitate to leave a message on 
 thanks for your help it is extremely appreciated i wasnt aware of the tagging guide but i will check that out before i upload the next image in the meanwhile i will continue to hunt for any other free images that might be out there thanks again 
 passed as ga fine work regards 
 no problem i tend to pick lowhanging fruit for my ga reviews and anything thats just had a mf c or e is going to be most of the way there 
 i have answered your query about greenstone at 
 thanks but not sure how to use the info disambig page change to the greenschist article beyond my knowledge cheers 
 note that vsmith corrected my 
 it all looks complicated thank goodness there are geologists around 
 please see 
 for further use the way to fix vandalism is through page history you can compare versions and click on the prefered version 
 hi i just wanted to say you have the best userpage i have ever seen i just want to know why on earth does it keep getting vandalized(ps speaking of which someone vandalized the 
 for further use the way to fix vandalism is through page history you can compare versions and click on the prefered version 
 thank you for your congrats i will keep my eye on the ew page 
 i am still as mad as hell about my most recent block but that has nothing at all to do with our working relationship 
 phew im relieved at that i have come to enjoy working with you and i continue to appreciate the advice and support you give i too was annoyed about that block it was stupid and i told the blocker so but i think any comment i made on her talk page and elsewhere got lost in the noise i just keep working quietly in my little corner and let the children out there fight the battles they seem to enjoy lifes too short and nbsp 
 i just reverted a bit of vandalism done by our good friend behind N and noticed your comment on the related talk page certainly that person has not been in a very prowikipedia mood lately so i can understand your frustration however i think that yelling on the talk page might have been the wrong way to go about things regardless of whether or not the current incarnation of N should be yelled at i think the overall tone of your comment sends a poor message about the wikipedia community to any future users of that ip address who may stumble across the talk page just my N and cent cheers 
 thank you for your comments i will refrain from using allcaps in the future hopefully this guy or gal can be brought down a few pegs in the future god bless 
 wow that is weird you know what they say its a small world after all 
 i trimmed the hook for alternate wording please to see if it works for you 
 this is still a decent article in which you put some worthwhile time into as all of the other conditions have been met there is a window of time to perhaps glean another small fact for the hook 
 as i have said elsewhere i really appreciate the trouble you have taken but in honesty i cannot find anything else hookworthy and i am content to let it rest 
 i also like your articles too much to let this one pass please take a look at N new alt suggestions on the dyk talk page best 
 thank you for your message i have added the source to the photo unfortunately it may still be a copyright violation because i uploaded back in the days when i had no idea what copyright was but thanks for your advice just the same and i will be sure to check my other images god bless 
 i think it probably is a copyright violation as i cant see anything on which allows reuse of the images i have changed the tag over to to reflect this cheers 
 i appreciated your welcome and helpful comments at 
 you are welcome a chance for me to draw some attention towards my home town 
 i disagree with your block of mN since you used i note that noone has written in your defence in the discussion at 
 hi william the reason for the block was that had returned to the behavior for which he or she had previously been blocked for an indefinite period this was in clear violation of the serious warnings against slipping back into this behaviour they received when they asked to be unblocked earlier this year i did notice that post but allowing another editor to add tags isnt a serious effort at dispute resolution as it was basically seeking to impose a settlement after the matter had reached ani this is in line with their conduct in the ani discussion in which they variously tried to take the matter to dispute resolution and the fairly extreme measure of both parties being blocked for nine months in regards to noone writing in mN s defence your comments were the closest to this but were hardly very supportive particularly when set against the editors history apologies if i misinterpreted them but they werent the reason for the block please note that i havent closed the thread i specifically said that i didnt look into alandalusis conduct beyond noting that they had also been edit warring and hopefully another admin will follow up on this regards 
 your comments were the closest to this but were hardly very supportive id have been far more supportive had i know anyone was planning on this step i cant see anyone but you with any enthusiasm for indefing mN i dont think that indefing one side and doing nothing to the other side is fair in this case because this is a pretty clear case where both sides have been fighting ala will certainly take your block as proof of his correctness 
 william said ala has uncompromisingly rejected those attempts dear nickd i have already explained on the board why i think misconceptionsN has not put anything on the table please see thank you 
 hi i saw you are listed in this category which is up for 
 i voted keep you can view my comments on that page thanks for the heads up i sure hope they keep them around 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or thank you for writing up so many redundant abandoned and ruined churches thus saving them at least virtually 
 thanks thats very generous of you its been a labour of love 
 i put plural women because in the storylines it states he falls for detective graves he also hits on another older woman 
 the storyline does ramble a bit and i missed the graves connection but the embarrassed bit links to the one woman hence my comment and edit maybe for dyk singular is better but i have no strong feeling keep it changed revert what do you think you are the expert on fictional characters 
 actually second thoughts i will keep it because anyone looking at the source might say the same its an easy mistake to make and i guess those looking if it is a dyk would only want to read about the hook thankyou 
 all the american females are too busy eating twice their bodyweight in mcdonalds 
 darn it all looks like i will have to see if any european women are at all interested 
 say dday which book did santa gove you for christmas (you know the one you mentioned for 
 the book is nascar chroncile by greg fielden i will be sure to list it as a source for the roty page yes it is a very intresting read might just coming handy for the other parts of the wikiproject 
 gotcha i was only joking with the brett bodine thing thanks for your contributions so far 
 hello another great little church article on the main page today i see anyway i thought it might be quite nice to make a little navigational template for the cct which is at 
 yes thanks for that uN id just spotted it i just wondered about adding 
 no that would be a good addition they are all relevant arent they i suppose at some point there is also scope for adding the 
 i didnt know about the scottish one although i suppose i ought to have realised there would be one for the title i always find the word redundant a bit of a turnoff which i suppose was a reason for the redundant churches fund changing their its how about lists of british preserved churches if we do that cct will have to have its five daughter lists i also suggest we leave out church of england otherwise we will have to have all the denominations involved which imo would serve little purpose a nice developing idea 
 mmm yes i agree actually i only put that in there as a filler i suppose i should have gone for 
 i like it 
 at 
 yes i did thanks 
 hello i have written a page about the 
 i like it too an excellent list in a short time its nice though to only have to have five churches in the list are you thinking of flc uN maybe when their website is up and running 
 im flattered at your request yes i will be more than happy to nominate you i think you would make a very good admin you can view the link at 
 thou shall not be a hypocrite doest thou have heard of thine golden rule i thought not 
 i hadt really thought about that but maybe its perhaps a bit short although there are only N churches under their care so i suppose thats as long as it can be as you say i will have to wait until their website is back up again i might put it up for dyk in the meantime 
 certainly go for dyk i had in mind in the distant distant future when all is complete of working towards a ft what do you think 
 please see 
 there is something definitely wrong with the report it is showing N articles on the webpage but the adopted orphans listtxt has N the extra N are 
 okay i ran the list but skipped those two now the webpage shows none listed but they are still listed on the adopted orphans listtxt 
 hm thats troubling i will take a look at it 
 that sounds like a good idea although i suppose that would mean that the article about the cct would need to be improved to at least a ga standard luckily the introductions to the individual lists are pretty good already and then i suppose something about its history and formation could be added perhaps something about why cofe churches became redundant as well i have their blue N booklet although i suspect thats somewhat out of date now 
 i completely agree we need 
 i have been in touch with cct they are bringing out a new version of their website at the end of march and suggest this may contain all the information we need i have replied to say that i am prepared to wait for it and see if it does if not i shall return and ask for more do you think we need to do anything sooner the last two lists will not be completed for some weeks or months 
 no problem we all make mistakes 
 thats good then i guess it would be best to wait for that to go online a bit like the scottish one i suppose it wouldnt hurt to add the generic referenced text from the regional list articles as a placeholder 
 good idea dunnit 
 i have just moved the salt museum northwich page to weaver hall museum and workhouse as thats the name the museum adopted last year the article needs improvements still so any suggestions would be helpful by next week i hope to add details on the collections visitor numbers and facilities and also some more citations to support the statements about the buildings history do you think a gallery of some images of museum items would be good idea they have prehistoric roman medieval and modern artefacts as well as salt industry related items 
 good for you i shall watch your work on the article with interest so far as a gallery is concerned wp is not very keen on them they prefer the images to be placed on commons see 
 the thread is deleted from jzgs page so i guess i will reply here to something you said i think that the more wikipedians act like cops the more we inflame situations and provoke more trolling the less we act like authority figures the less drama there is the most coplike admins tend also to be the most controversial and controversy is bad for the project as encyclopedia writers our job is to avoid things such as drama and controversy that distract from the task at hand you may think of some editors as bad guys but making it clear that you think that they are bad guys and you are a good guy tends to lead to escalation of conflict the more effective approach is to be very very boring to never talk about anybodys personal motivations and to simply apply sound editorial judgment and insist that we talk about that and not about personalities as kilerchihuahua used to say thats one puppys opinion 
 ironically i happen to have a whole little essay i wrote on the concept of wikipedians as cops and noncops some day when im not in any disputes with anyone and when i think it might be helpful rather than hurtful i will post it doing so now would make people think im commenting on specific individuals and specific disputes when im really just trying to say almost exact same thing as gtbacchus just said 
 any idea why you deleted 
 someone created thousands of stubs for minor waterways and all sorts of other things often from very unreliable sources it took us weeks to get through them all theres nothing to stop recreation if theres good sources etc 
 no worries i was guessing something like that was behind it all 
 itd be somewhere in the awnb archive theres a bunch of christmas creeks and ndash 
 ok reason i asked was that there are some images in the slq donation with a subject header of christmas creek do you think any of them are notable so we can set up a dab page 
 the whole idea of that deletion was that only the ones worth recreating would come back into existence so if this one has sources by all means if the notability threshold isnt crossed by the creek itself try the nearest town or shire 
 a very nice piece of work you seem to be getting through a lot of st marys churches at the moment i have reviewed and passed your nomination of it on ttdyk any chance you could have a look at my nomination of 
 i have been beaten to it dr b is back your article looks good too i think that a there are a lot of st marys churches and b like the no N bus they come in runs 
 hmmm well id like everything arranged so the barnstars dont fall to the bottom of the page and also with the influx of userboxes and assorted images on there the table of contents gets kind of weird and its difficult to find the edit button to work in just a certain section also im not that great with html but perhaps a solid color background and some decorations would make good additions other than that i have no real requests just as long as nothing is removed thanks for your interest 
 i have created a test at 
 thanks 
 your sig links to the article 
 ooh now i get it thanks for the heads up 
 hi peter in case you hadnt noticed i have finally bunged the above into the encyclopedia upwards from the bottom of the se list as im happier with named architects as against medieval masons and suchlike im planning to add a stub on the architect of the original st lukes one of N architects called john johnson who overlapped during the cN could you have a look and check the categories and talkpage banners and so on i might be able to wring a dyk out of this one if i think hard enough best 
 thats excellent many thanks just the sort of article imo suitable for populating the list its fine that you are starting with the newest at present i am working down the east of england list progress is good but there is still quite a lot to do my plan is to complete the churches on that list go for fl with it and start working on the se list if i begin at the top we may meet somewhere sometime cheers 
 hey thanks for signing up in 
 hey dday id like to let you know i have contacted bugsN here is a to the message i have left for him 
 hey dday do you have an irc client if so id like to set up a meeting between bugs you and myself let me know thanks 
 im not sure what an irc is 
 just curious uN if you know how rare is it for a church to be partially redundant i always assumed that church of england church buildings were either redundant or nonredundant not part of each however as an american i could simply have missed whats actually a commonplace situation if you reply here please leave me a talkback 
 an interesting question its unusual but not unique at a guess less than N per cent examples that come to mind are 
 it answers my question and provides much more information as well your example of st oswalds makes me think of the 
 hi there once you have judged all N of the finalists use the email this user feature to let me know and give me the score cheers 
 oh sorry you also have to pick you finalist first all the best 
 happy birthday dday 
 thanks everyone 
 ooops happy belated birthday 
 hi sorry about too many jokes on the dyk tangent and thanks for reviewing the article regarding the history of the tangent it started 
 the jokes are fun too wp is fun provided the vandals and idiots keep away cheers 
 yes and now there is 
 hey dday i have spoken to bugs again i have created a sub page for him with a few admin like scenarios please feel free to take a look and add any additional questions or comments 
 done 
 hello peter we havent met but you come highly recommended and you are a dyk regular would you mind having a quick look at 
 two things first there has to be a citation directly after the hook second and more important i think the hook has to say what the source says the source doesnt say anything about sodomy the picture looks like it it may be but it may not be imo it is too dangerous to use this hook without the text being more direct about it hope that helps cheers and thanks for contacting me 
 peter your concerns suffice thanks 
 i assume that you dont want your user page deleted it is listed on candidates for speedy deletion for some reason or other 
 i think its because one of the userboxes is being considered for deletion i sure hope my page isnt 
 its weird i noticed that happening with other peoples user pages one of their userboxes is up for speedy deletion and the whole user page shows up on csd this has to be a mistake right 
 it must be some mistake i will think i will take this to the userboxe project and see what they know thanks for the heads up 
 no problem good luck 
 i just listed a category i created accedentally for speedyd and now im there too although im not too happy about userboxes being deleated either so hard to say 
 i took the userrecreate off my page and my name came off the canadidates for speedyd page thats an interesting tactic 
 in response to another editor i have been cleaning up 
 thanks for your query i have been puzzled by the redlinks on this page and on corresponding disambig pages and i dont understand why they are there whether the churches are notable or not imo they should not be included on this page unless there is a linked article so far as i am concerned they can be deleted if and when an article is written they can then be reinstated sorry i do not have the time to write articles on them at present notable or not as i am engrossed in other projects hope that helps 
 i happen to think it makes wikipedia a more rational friendly place if we help the new editors along where with their inclusionist perspective where we can easily agree that their nominated places are indeed wikipedianotable by either way of supporting the dab entry of course you dont have to choose to be involved in this it doesnt matter too greatly whether the redlink is removed and not added until later when a good big article like those you specialize in is created i just wonder if it would be easy for you as an apparently wellinformed editor on english churches to identify which of the english redlinks are in fact probably quite notable and to further along others constructive involvement happy to exchange views further or not i do think you do very good work and you definitely do not have to get involved with this stuff at all if it does not interest you 
 im very impressed by the way this is organised in usa we are miles behind i have a little offering to make on the st and nbspjames churches would you like me to have a look at the redlinks over the weekend advise which of those are notable and maybe even write a twosentence stub that would confirm their notability (for example if they are listed they are notable in the opinion of 
 about organizing in england i recently saw a bot request about starting articles or lists from english heritage any computerized big approach should include an effort to create or add to dab pages as part of the upfront development and part of what a computer can help with very well i do think that my effort to predisambiguate in the us has been worthwhile i wasnt clear about the likelihood of a bot actually working though cheers 
 ok all the english st james churches are now blue a combination of new stubs some retitling a redirect a deletion of a church already done under a different title and the rotherham church deleted because it was ambiguous having done that what about the other redlinks for english churches in disambig pages im not sure what has been achieved by this exercise do we want stubs on all the listed st and nbspjames churches in england uN and then what about st and nbsppeter st and nbspmary and nbsp it would be good to have something on all the listed english churches but that might take some time cheers 
 i do think english listed buildings ought to get added systematically to all these church dabs and commented towards that at the bot request at 
 im sorry i havent found time to help out with the 
 oh thats ok take your time heck i should have studied more for my chemistry test but instead i messed around on here 
 it certainly gets people over here to your talk page i got a chuckle when i first saw it today so i figured id let you know 
 hee hee thanks i like yours too 
 im really concerned about your recent behavior related to the userbox issue i was shocked when i discovered that you created three templates about michael jackson that were either outright attacks or at least in very poor taste and posting threats like is inappropriate on drv debate the issue on its merits dont let the stress take over and remember that wikipedia is an encyclopedia first there is no point in getting so worked up about this im saying this to you because i still believe that you are a serious contributor and that you just happened to hang out with the wrong crowd so to speak believe me that i wouldnt bother contacting you if i thought that you were incapable of seeing the light in my opinion the best way forward would be for you to go directly from denial or anger to acceptance jimbo wales has made it clear that polemical userboxes dont have much of a future here they are already banned from the french wikipedia and the german wikipedia the longer they are allowed to stay here the more painful it will be when they do get deleted for good its better that this happens now in a clean break so that everybody can move on cheers 
 the michael jackson templates may have been out of whack but im still protecting userboxes i dont think im hanging out with the wrong crowd at all thanks for your concern anyway 
 hi peter im reviewing your latest nomination i have aggravations elsewhere up nrth so im decided to do yours instead 
 hi delighted to hear that i try not to cause aggro but i do have form if you dare have a look at 
 i must be getting too soft in future i must remember to be more nit picking when i review your nominations my form is 
 i like soft reviewers they do not evoke anger i thought that churchill might have been the cause of your northerly trouble the harvard links seemed to work without the extra field but i will try to add it in future happy days 
 i will gladly help to save divisive userboxes im just not sure how to do so point me in the right direction and i will readily be your ally 
 ok well first of all you can monitor 
 i looked it over and did one small mos edit on dashes as well as checking the sources the sourcing looks fine to me trust malleus copyedits and queries hes much better at the whole nonhorse thing than i am i spent the weekend hanging out with sailors and that was interesting they are almost as jargon heavy as horse people and threequarters of the time i had no freaking clue what the hell they were talking about certainly put a new perspective on the poor folks who have to read our horse articles 
 quick how much jargon is in the ga and fa navigation and sailing articles do we finally have an example of accepted terms of art that normal people accept so that we can quit being forced to say the horses mommy instead of dam please poseidon is the god of the sea and horses he understands both so can we make an offering to him or something 
 lol i know what you mean about sailors im engaged to one so when he and his buddies get together i tend to just mentally check out since even after almost two years i still cant understand half of the conversation as for the icelandic article thanks for the help i will get to the rest of malleus suggestions soon hopefully i was all set to be able to have a lot of time on wp and then work sat on me over N hrs of overtime over what was supposed to be a N day weekend yay for the money but sucks for the rest of my life since by the time i get home all i want to do is sleep anyway i will see what i can do with his suggestions over the next few days thanks again 
 ooooohhh pretty thank you 
 more here 
 re marks sweep i documented my attempt to open a diologue with him here 
 here ya go and you are in it btw 
 my thats big stuff thanks it may be andy 
 i know that you have been involved in creating articles on churches and halls so please could you have a look at 
 and 
 many thanks for your invitation they look an interesting selection of heritage buildings but im afraid that i am in the middle of a rather large project in making all the redlinks blue in 
 what is your opinion on the proposed solution for all userboxes to be substed and then have the templates deleted this is probably the best solution as many of the antiuserbox crowd simply object to them being in the template namespace 
 i have also heard of that solution and it sounds doable i also like the idea of them being in the user namespace honestly it doesnt matter to me i just want the nonoffensive ones to be kept and the whole war to stop 
 cheers 
 ok i will remember that 
 thank you for signing my 
 also on the rfc against marksweep add vandalism or censorship of my userpage 
 one other thing struck me as i was looking through that you are making a lot of work for yourself with the alt texts bear in mind that they are alternatives to the images not descriptions of them i generally just use altphotograph 
 thanks for all you have done uN much appreciated once again i have deleted impressive and thanks for the advice on alt text i thought i read somewhere that one had to describe it as to a blind person having reread the instructions i realise that as you say if its just a photo of some thing described fully in the text altphotograph should suffice 
 hi peter i will try to provide a review in the next day or two have been busy with 
 thanks for the message you certainly have some megaprojects and thanks for offering to do the sussex churches im gradually working down the list and 
 thanks with the copyedit there anonemouse 
 hey im not done yet give me a minute 
 there btw since it is in your user space feel free to strike it if you feel it is not suitable not in the general spirit of the page or merely insufficiently funny 
 thanks anon i like it i can see an ew presidents delete argument snowballing at dekkappedia afd discussions already 
 yeah this userbox thing is a whole pile of suck you ever get into the irc room lets hang out sometime 
 sorry you are feeling so stressed but dont despair things will get better eventually 
 i liked the andor twist of a hook these events are usually in london fancy a shorter trip see there are N nearby churches cheers roger 
 thanks a nice idea but i am booked for a cheshire archaeology day in winsford cheers 
 i have decided to create a wikiproject devoted to discussing what articles qualify as gamecruft and what do not contact me if you are interested or have questions 
 part N hopefully this part will involve us doing the same against the pokxeN mon articles fire emblem articles or final fantasy articles 
 hi again i saw a comment on the flc in relation to dates of redundancy might be what you need each link is a pdf showing dates present uses etc for all redundant churches for a single diocese only problem is the url seems to change frequently 
 now that looks very useful i had come across some of these pages on google searches but not really understood them and moved on can you advise if my interpretation is correct in the date effective column the date is the date of redundancy if the church has been vested in say the cct it is the date opposite preservation in the future type column if so thats a lot of work to be done if you create a lot of articles the time taken to maintain them that may mean that there is no time for new articles the cct has changed all its urls recently and i am struggling to update them in all the articles and i am changing the ioe links in the cheshire articles to heritage gateway links phew 
 sorry for the late reply yes your interpretation agrees with mine which is that the redundancy date is the first listed and the date effective next to future type preservation is the date the church was vested in the cct im reviewing the east of england list at the moment 
 thanks im glad you agree because i have been adding this info to some new articles 
 i will archive this eventually lol cant explain the userpage thing though looks fine on my laptop 
 i can set up a talk archive for you if you are lazy just let me know the user page looks fine for me its just those annoying section title underlines that break the look 
 weird its laid out horizontally for me and i cant read some of the sections im using ie i will try looking at this with firefox when i get home maybe ie just has a problem with it 
 ah looks great in firefox ie just sucks 
 having noted your very considerable work on the royal liverpool philharmonic article i wonder if you might be interested in commenting at the peer review of the article on sir thomas who was no stranger to the phil quite understand if not of course but any observations would be gratefully received 
 thanks for asking me to comment im not realy a reviewer but i read through it and spotted a few trifles you may like to address an excellent article interesting and readable and pretty comprehensive the article should go well best wishes 
 splendid thanks so much for your comments very much to the point if i can ever reciprocate please dont hesitate 
 hi can you check your dyk entry for st marys church fleet marston there is a problem with the hook 
 thanks amendment made 
 i opened the discussion on this on the talkpage of 
 thanks fainites i wanted to do that my self tomorrow 
 hi peter do you know about st werburghs is opposite we have pics of old churchs a cathedral and a pugin church in walking distance 
 thanks yes i did know about it but i already have an engagement for saturday uN cheshire archaeology day in winsford i hope the derby event is a big success best wishes 
 thats fine i have changed the url 
 it is a strange title for a church i wrote it in some detail because i was intrigued by sharpes pot churches i should have done more redirects at the time uN to prevent this kind of confusion good luck with the rest of the articles 
 ok how come they never publish the real names of the players on this game 
 because ncaa rules prohibit it 
 keep em coming peter 
 thanks malleus not being an owl i have only just discovered it many thanks for the part you played in its success it proved to be much more difficult than planned because the cct completely changed its website during the process so i had to change all the urls and get rid of some information no longer available working now on the last list to complete the set uN se england i continue to be amazed at the number and variety of old heritage buildings still in existence 
 an image that you uploaded or altered 
 numerous other images of yours have been listed on 
 hi peter i did 
 still all is not bad lancs have just beaten sussex by an innings 
 it was a spectacular collapse i will say we made the wrong call on the toss thanks for fixing the refs i think i copied the bibliography entries from another article rather than from my definitive book list where they are all correct whiteman ran to N editions N and N in the old days i used the N edition but then i found the N one and went with that instead universal identity number looks a likely explanation it seems a sensible development i have just noticed the interactive map which plots the location of listed buildings etc a very welcome feature 
 im glad you decided not to stay away for long 
 thanks alot some stuff came up but those have been cleared away 
 hi peter i vardy first of all congratulations to getting 
 thats great we rather hoped we would find a local who could do the honours many thanks 
 i just got a message welcoming me from you thanks i feel welcomed i have actually been around for about a year now but just recently started really editing a lot so thanks for the message 
 i just got one too when i first saw the you have a message thing i though i was in trouble luckily i wasnt thanks dday 
 many thanks 
 sorry i dont think i can help a pity about flickr they look good photos i dont live near enough and all i can find is this 
 thats a nice gift i feel a bit lost there do you know of any place where photo requests can be done 
 the only thing i can suggest is a request on the talk page of 
 in your comment 
 got it thanks dude 
 you are welcome uN 
 aw i wanted to email you some remarks about your userpage and relating to part of it but you dont have the email function enabled talk to me if youd like uN 
 thanking you for all your dedication and terrific work on churches but especially for introducing a page on saint john maddermarket from where i was able to find a magnificent portrait of the N th duchess of norfolk kevin faulkner N N april N 
 thanks you are very welcome 
 if substantial content is duplicated and it is not 
 and that site in turn was taken from without attribution that is 
 yes i know it can be funny but with every contributor deciding they need to make an april fools prank it is not so funny for the people who need try to clean it up sorry about being so grumpy i had a tough day here yesterday and today 
 nominating afd for deletion has been tried before it has even been deleted once if you have been planning it for months it is not very creative grouchily yours 
 so all my heritage gateway links seem to be dead ( 
 so do mine ( 
 they are heritage gateway is still there but is now part of the national heritage list for england its early days yet but i have discovered that the hg site now includes scheduled monuments as well as listed buildings i guess thats an advantage but all the reference numbers have changed hg now uses a N digit list entry number rather than the N or N digit uid all you have to do is to substitute the len for the uid in the url and the link works again my time is limited this weekend because we are on grandparent duties and i do not know if theres a simple way of doing this other than manually incidentally listed buildings online has gone too it takes you to the new home page of the national heritage list for me this comes on top of the churches conservation trust changing its website that meant hundreds of urls having to be changed this means thousands unless someone can find a way of automising it the expert in these matters is hassocks he is away for the weekend but i think he will be watching this page and see it when he returns if you want to see how it works have a look at 
 this is so cruel but you are so helpful 
 ohh i didnt see the conversation above before i started this do we know if the new list is complete if so im not loving the useability of it as i cant seem to find lots of building that should be there ah well time to start changing numbers over i guess 
 or not as poultonlefylde doesnt seem to exist any more grr 
 i think the list is complete and up to date both hassocks and i have found buildings listed in N that do not appear on the old hg i sympathise with your difficulty about plf all i could find was an ice house at singleton hall but everything seems to be on the interactive map 
 i have not tried the map yet thats the next thing i found all the plf buildings in the end they are just very well hidden they dont seem to have been attached to a parish as such and the only way in the end was to get the list for the whole of wyre and pick them out i also found an extra one for fleetwood listed just this march so i have stopped grumbling 
 hi while 
 unfortunately im not an admin so i guess that disqualifies me yeah i dont have the time to that unfortunately thanks for checking 
 if this is an example of esperanzas civility standards then im glad im not a member 
 if admins seem to constantly delete userboxes for no reason or delete userboxes for fake reasons then something needs to be said itd be one thing if this was a rare occurence but due to the rather frequent occurence of such deletions its time someone stands up for what they believe in 
 fine stand up for what you believe in but dont wear a big green 
 two wrongs dont make a right esperanza was formed to build a greater sense of community among wikipedians making snide remarks about others even if they have been rude does not help achieve this goal 
 dear doc please stop insulting the esperanza community and using a sarcastic tone against fellow wikipedians and please explain in what way was ddays comment incivil thank you 
 i have no problems with esperanza i dont intend to insult it it is a noble idea but if people put notes in their sigs and bumper stickers on their userpages advertising their membership of an organisation committed to civility and friendliness then we can expect them to try to live up to their advertisements not bring said organisation into disrepute and frankly if you cant recognise the problem with calling people clueless then well 
 i agree with the doc not to single dday out but we really need to apply the standards of esp if we are going to be members and mdash 
 i second that i respect dday but that green e does mean something 
 i will give this some more thought in the next few days now i am back in circulation the priority should be i suppose to update all featured content to avoid potential appearances at 
 thanks hassocks its good to have you back thanks for all your comments above i too have been away since wednesday looking after grandsons at the other end of the country fortunately i had internet access to deal with the edge of the problem now i am about to go out to chair a meeting more time later i hope in the meantime all i have done is merely to substitute the old number with the new number it certainly works as an immediate solution i like your replacement format but im not clever enough to do that spreadsheet thing my own plan is to carry on with some proper wiki work and in the gaps between do some of the boring updating of numbers lets hope people out there have a rest from change for a while 
 interesting points i have been busy too and not had a chance to look any more at the new list yet but im impressed by some of the new details i agree that a template for referencing would be useful 
 please cease and desist this disruptive editing 
 it was agreed upon that it was ready for the mainspace also im being far from disruptive here 
 have any of these or 
 these are a bit exotic for the churches i have been writing about the only baldachin i can find on a quick look is in the 
 thanks im not sure that is actually one though the term is often used loosely the canopy over the pulpit would be better called that imo you dont happen to have books with names and dates for the ones at derby and peterborough cathedrals by any chance oddly enough baldachin was originally cloth from bagdhad i discover 
 sorry no 
 you are my d uN 
 i know its great 
 ok i have downloaded everything i just need to know how do i activate or use it for the first time much obliged dday(
 try opening a page by adding what a wikilink would have into the blank box above the word add in the make list aria and then clicking the item in the big box on the right and then going to start and start process during one of these steps it may ask you to log in 
 im having a little trouble understanding what you are trying to say could you put into less technical terms dday(
 thanks for your reply honestly i have only got installed so far i dont know what im supposed to do next am i missing anything i have downloaded everything im supposed to have dday(
 ok i have got it up and running now i use firefox fyi dday(
 thanks for that ref i knew id seen it somewhere vaguely but couldnt find the page top quality work with places like this and ellough by the way 
 thanks to you too 
 hi there i have just been categorising a few churches and have a quick question are only active churches considered part of a diocese 
 i dont have a definitive answer but i can give a rambling one redundant churches are not parish churches and so are not part of the formal diocesan structure all churches active or redundant exist within a parish some churches have been converted into other uses and some are now active but used by other denominations so clearly these are not part of the anglican diocesan structure most of the churches vested with the 
 thanks that makes sense and i agree while i was waiting to see what you thought i have just been adding ones i can determine are active to the diocese categories 
 theres been a slow revert war occurring between 
 saw what you said looks great but one problem i think it was valrith who reverted katja and not spinachmaster youd be well advised to doublecheck that accusation and speaking of valrith that reminded me of an earlier problem which had slipped my mind 
 nope read the talk page section i wrote the diff is there i thought that too at first from the edit summaries then actually looked at the diffs it seems spinachmaster thought he was reverting valrith and restoring the article to katjakassins version but he wasnt p considering the subject matter of the article there is a very appropriate term for this situation everyone meant well but no one talked to anyone else and it just got worse thanks for letting me know that article wasnt on my watchlist and clearly will be now ah a blp issue that i will be enforcing instead of railing against whats the world coming to anyway i have to go finish my apology in the name of wikipedia to 
 i added my opinion to 
 now about 
 thats exactly how it occured emails from sydnee if you drop me an email i can forward some of the emails to you and by the way it looks like katja has an email address associated with her wikipedia account 
 try its a bit old though 
 thats where i came across it or at least an earlier version of the same text bentleys original written towards the end of the N th century 
 i dont read minds but im very trying 
 i bet you i could make a decent article even out of that one tiny mention lol 
 i read something very recently an anglosaxon or norman law that allowed landowners to dish out summary justice on people found up to no good on their land i cant recall what it was called though 
 it was called 
 i hope you all know 
 ah so thats where i read it 
 if substantial content is duplicated and it is not 
 nope nice try i took it from 
 i think its cool your a packer fan i was able to catch only one pack game in my life tickets are too hard to get i live one hour south of gb 
 its nice to be finally able to see your userpage in xp i got my first true glimpse of it a few weeks ago in my pc operating systems class when we were playing around with red hat linix would you please do a little minor cleanup to saids article i dont think its clear what hes up to in cup this year thanks 
 almost anything you can do can be undone but please take a look at 
 thanks for the bit good to see that templates working now uN 
 congratulations from downunder looking forward to seeing your work around the traps 
 thanks vs uN 
 i cannot find anything in my very limited personal library and a search of ormerod didnt find the phrase i did find the following links good luck with your decapitations 
 thanks i only stumbled across it yesterday so i havent done much in the way of research yet but i think theres enough for a little article 
 that sounds interesting good luck 
 id be interested to see the original source as i think custom of chester may not be a defined term is there anything more specific than roll N edw ii comparing halifax with cheshire is also problematic as cheshire was a 
 from memory southampton also had a similar law but remember that the lord of the manor of wakefield which was about N square miles including halifax was the earl of surrey one of the most powerful men in postconquest england im quite convinced that halifax is unusual only in that it was the last place in england to abandon the custom of infangtheof 
 i noticed that you added several images from flickr today very cool im concerned that you didnt add enough information about the origin of these photos i think you need to provide a link to the original flickr image for it to stand up in the image peoples minds i think this is more what they are expecting id hate to see your time wasted because of something little like the summary the trend seems to be checking each an every image for copyright infringement i have been adding all the flickr images that i found to wikicommons i went through all flickr images today i noticed that we uploaded the same image for kenseth so i will get rid of one of the duplicates i hope you like your new nascar barnstar 
 pardon me i was looking at kahnes image when i made these statements the kenseth image was tagged properly would you go back to kahnes image and clear it up i nominated the kenseth image for deletion and swapped in the wikicommons image sorry about the confusion 
 let me know if you ever decide to run for an admin so i can vote for you i personally know a few other people on here that i would talk for additional support i bet youd get widespread support with the wikiproject nascar member for all that you have done for the project im not interested in being an admin i dont have the right personality you saw how frustrated i sometimes get with the stupid hoops you sometimes have to run through to get something mundane done 
 been busy helping barno on the modified article the image that i used for the barnstar is us govt free use image it looks excellent on the wikiproject nascar template but way too small to be seen on the user box template i dont know what you mean about using the image for a barnstar image or how to go about doing that its funny that an article that appeared about john holman was for an australian politician not the nascar owner i coordinated with the other author and set up a dis page 
 heres how uploading with wikicommons works you upload the file to wikicommons just like you do to wikipedia you then access the file the same way that you do with wikipedia so i have been uploading all of my images to wikicommons since there is no difference i hope you do the same i have been adding the categorynascar to all nascar photos for easier searching later 
 yes you are right but they havent wrecked the article i see that they are engaging in a 
 not sure really i guess that if christian communities want to take redundant churches back into active use that could or should be a good thing for cct that will save them loads of money and presumably as virtually all of the churches are listed eh will be involved in any structural alterations i am watching the liverpool development with interest as i drive past the church every time i venture into the city 
 could i ask you for a little help he was quite important in the history of tyldesley and my book has a drawing of damhouse by his wife sarah 
 dunnit its the onb ref thats confusing uN i can never get the template for that to work 
 thank you you know i still get confused if something is unfamiliar even after all this time 
 dont we all 
 if substantial content is duplicated and it is not 
 comment made on talk page 
 thanks for that i have updated the links and added one 
 while reading through a history of 
 sorry about the delay in responding only arrived home late last night from a few days in the torrid heat of geneva not sure that i can help there a number of tattons named robert ormerod mentions this one briefly but with no details other than that the house was toughly defended by the smallest garrison for most probably upwards of a year with occasional intervals before it was taken but no more details about his derringdo nothing about any tatton in the odnb the only reference to this time in de figueiredo and treuherzs cheshire country houses is to an inventory taken of the house in N after it was captured by the parliamentarians dont think this is of much use to you 
 yeah i checked the odnb and was surprised to find no tattons i might see what i can do with robert for starters 
 i have made a start 
 i begin to think that there might even be a cheshire ga in this given a couple more sources 
 yes i shall follow the progress of the article with interest 
 faint heart never won fair lady so i have nominated it at gan we will see what happens i think this qualifies as a cheshire article at any rate its less gruesome than my 
 thanks peter i was lucky photographywise because one of my work colleagues who also happens to be in charge of keeping the cct church at 
 id just move it to the correct title 
 ok done 
 i have moved the other one as well 
 hmm are you sure about this it does seem notable and wellsourced even though being a still very recent news item and written like a news release im not going to reverse your decision i already spoke with the author in the irc help channel and he agreed to hold off on it until more time has passed so its not a big deal or anything but maybe you could take a second look at it 
 came to leave a very similar message you are still going a bit too fast kev clearly asserted notability and the author was naturally rather annoyed about the spurious hold i know its not yet up to scratch but thats what we are here for as reviewers to bring our skills in formatting and knowledge of wikipedias guidelines to helping newbies create articles about subjects which are established to be notable please be more conscientious about your reviews we are after all customer service in a way on the forefront of interaction with people outside our community who have something to contribute and we do not need those people leaving thinking we are incompetent i will be working on the article in question but id advise you to tread carefully when reviewing afcs from now on because its got to a point where you have been cautioned more than once for this exact thing and i would expect better from an established editor 
 to olenglish i was wrong and sorry for not getting back to you earlier but i skipped over this i just created it as we speak to sonia i was being overly cautious there and i just placed it on hold it was a dumb mistake and i take full responsibility for it 
 thats it good luck at flc 
 many thanks once again i will look through it again and then face the music 
 i am very concerned with tN do you have any ideas on how to stop it from being implimented 
 im just writing to inform you that there is a userbox that i created against tN if you would like to use it 
 hi i noticed you have been doing some work on 
 thanks for the message not sure about this as a fl its difficult to get enough source material to make an adequate lead we will see confession i have just uploaded an article on another lancashire church uN 
 yes i have been meaning to do st helens for ages i actually started it last year when i was just starting on these architectural articles but was struggling with making sense of the sources a bit hopefully now i can go back to it and understand it all a bit better luckily there are still plenty to go around i might add to some of the ones you have started but im quite happy to carry on whatever referenceing style they start with 
 hi your signature is extremely long and makes it very hard to read talk pages that you participate on it interrupts the flow considerably please make it much much smaller thanks in advance 
 its better but on my screen it takes up half a line of text on any line its on that seems like a lot maybe make the font size of the additions smaller that might help 
 yes much thanks 
 with many thanks from cheshire for that yes there are some cheshire country houses still without articles the category houses in cheshire does contain N items which is not bad but some of them are buildings in chester or works of 
 i will take a look at the chester walls list probably later 
 i have done a small stub on 
 so not much there to worry about really good luck at flc 
 also when you reinserted your sig you changed the date of your comment making it look like what you posted occurred after the reply please do not do that as it breaks the sense of the conversation regards 
 as to the userbox issue i am finding there is a lot of confusion about what deletion from template space means it doesnt mean that userboxes will go away just that they wont be in template space for example look at my user page see the nice three userboxes i simply converted to use layout but my page still looks the same so now if gets deleted my page is unchanged im happy and people wanting userboxes out of template space are happy everyones happy thats why i find it hard to understand why people object to moving userboxes out of template space they are not being deleted as the user pages will be still look the same in fact theres a major advantage as if i remained with that would mean that if anyone vandalised that template my page would change along with N s of others so as far as i can see there are many advantages to moving them to user space with very few disadvantages regards 
 hello again it was good to see your comment that you were going to switch to if you have any problems please let me know and i can show how to do one or two and the rest will be same plus by doing so you will learn how to cutomise them yourself if you so choose regards 
 you should write N cheers 
 i made a proposal for N please help see 
 i have suggested a slight rewording for the first section concision 
 whats the difference between an infinite and an indefinite block in what cases should i use each one 
 this was a confusing change that someone made to the interface the two are technically identical only the infinite one is practically incorrect its been removed now 
 then why doesnt someone remove one of the duplicate indefinite choices in the expiry box on 
 i agree i dont know and i just did 
 thanks for that im messing about myself with de figueiredo and treuherz so we will have to make sure we are not duplicating anything at present im looking at alderley old hall 
 i will leave it to you then as you have got a better idea about this kind of article than i have i was bristling anyway when i read about the dismal conditions the servants lived in which once again reminds me that i really must make an effort to finish off 
 fine im just doing short stubs at present with lots of opportunity for future expansion feel free if you ever get the urge 
 but theres no credit for expanding articles only for creating them 
 yes there is when you get them to fa these stubs are rubbish but at least its a beginning 
 i wonder if either of you could solve a little mystery has a long grass walk the northern part of which appears to be cut in two by the bridgewater canal is this so or did some bored farmer just chop some trees in that copse down to make it appear that his field was a bit posh also in that little copse is some kind of monument or cenotaph but unusually there are no piccies of it on geograph im going to go have a look what it is anyone know 
 nevN might be the best person to ask about that 
 i was just following the conversation above really the little monument i refer to is visible on bing maps if you look on the birds eye view it looks like a cenotaph but isnt accessible by the public 
 it could be the obelisk to the racehorse mentioned 
 thanks what a rubbish photograph though so a bit of a mission there 
 how do you make your english heritage searches like work peter i just cant find my way around that site at all for some reason 
 playing about practice and making mistakes i guess its actually quite good when you get used to it in this case i knew that the hall was in the parish of nether alderley so i went into advanced search clicked on location then just put nether alderley in the parish field one of the easier ones really if you know the parish thats the easiest sometimes other or building name will do it if you have the images of england ref number put it in reference number or old record number otherwise play around you can usually get there one way or another now if you want a difficult site to search try the historic wales portal thats a real grownup challenge 
 theres also the map search if you know roughly where it is on a map or using google with the site function i still find the site pretty user unfriendly though 
 ps dont be tempted to use the 
 its perhaps still useful for its photographs though 
 it is but they are copyright and you cant use them you can usually find equivalents on geograph and you can add them to articles the same for some flickr pics 
 ah yes there is that looking at your city walls list again i just noticed that theres no grade column even though the coloured key remains in place that cant be right surely 
 i have renominated you for admin accept or decline 
 i did not mean to create a wppoint please dont take it that way 
 where is your rfa i need to vote and leave comments 
 hey i noticed you protected the article 
 probably better to create a page in your userspace with the content and link it if its ready for publication then i can unprotect the article so you can move your userspace draft to the mainspace location 
 hey the article is ready be moved into the mainspace now its here 
 excellent work now moved for you 
 the vandalize this page sub page seems to have disappeared into a maze of redirects 
 people moving the subpage mercilessly i guess i will fix it now 
 yes you are right so i have deleted the key and incorporated the info into the lead what do you think of the move to merge the list with the ratherpooratpresent 
 i have just seen it and commented im against a merge 
 thanks nicely argued 
 nice going with all the country house stubs you have created do you think that 
 in respect of the cheshire houses im rather enjoying myself i guess its worthwhile its certainly interesting and its easier than going for gas etc but until i arrived at part two of figueirdo and treuherz i didnt realise how many notable country houses there are in the county plenty to do im already in those beginning with b 
 the number of houses in part two of figueiredo came as a bit of a surprise to me tell you what to help you out i will do all those beginning with x y and z cant say fairer that that im beginning to remember why it was i got involved in this project which id rather lost sight of the hope that if people knew more about their environment and its history theyd perhaps start to have more respect for it when i feel like a break from the tatton family i might have a go at backfilling one or two of your cheshire country house articles and see where we can take them id really like to do something with some of the many poor settlement articles as well but the constant stream of notable soap stars and footballers who once spent in a night in the town becomes very wearing to say nothing of the mrs merton once said in a tv show that she came from heaton norris nonsense or the constant arguments about historical county boundaries altrincham is in cheshire no it isnt its in greater manchester no its in cheshire because i live in altrincham and i should know 
 thanks any help with cheshire is welcomed although i should have thought that cheshire houses are for you a bit lacking in controversy i have more or less given up on settlement articles too much work for me in the laziness of retirement incidentally in correspondence with jN mrs i revisited the article on 
 i will probably focus on the ones that are haunted as for william charles cotton i think that could be pretty easily buffed up to get through gan particularly if the lead was expanded a bit i have only had a quick shuffty so far but i will go through in more detail later if you like got to pop out for the rest of the afternoon the ending isnt quite right though as it looks like you are expressing your own opinion about cottons life and work in saying the comment that while he was there he had occasional periods of effectiveness seems unfair looks like its you saying that it seems unfair

 hi peter in this edit you provided some figures which i have taken the liberty of adding to the article can you tell me where the figures are from so i can reference it please 
 the source is i dont know if you have discovered this it only started this year but is the authoritative source for listed buildings registered parks and gardens scheduled monuments and more its beauty is that it is kept up to date it effectively replaces images of england which is stuck in N has not been updated and will not be updated i have found on the new list buildings listed after N grades changed grades a b c updated etc the advanced search facility is not the easiest to use but with practice it gets easier particularly if you know the parish you are away to specifically answer your question go into advanced search click location on the dropdown menu for county click lancashire then click grade the dropdown menu there gives you the opportunity to select all grades or the one you want for citations i use the following and fill in the gaps {{citation or url or title or yearN or workthe national heritage list for england or publisher
 thank you peter most helpful as usual it is the most awful site i absolutely loathe it i can find most of the info i want on listed buildings online it is far more user friendly but i realise as a commercial site not good enough for here 
 persevere i rather like it now and im not sure that lbo is kept up to date i was assured by english heritage that the nhl is updated daily if you want a difficult site try historic wales now that is a challenge

 ok 
 yes you are right i was tempted to link it out of frustration that there is no article on the studio system thanks for removing the link i thought it would be rather harmless because i posted it on a talk page i find it interesting that quite a number of pages link to the studio system entry http or or enwikipediaorg or wiki or specialwhatlinkshere or studio_system but that no one has written an article about it the reason is perhaps that the studio system a number of negative connotiations related to commercialism and hollywood there is however also a historical background of which i do not know enough to write the entry for the time being i have redirected 
 it should be pointed out that while a hollywood redirect isnt ideal a wholly blank page is worthless its still a blue link so no one will automatically feel inspired to write the article and no context whatsoever is provided to someone who visits the page and mdash and nbsp
 thanks for doing the stub the original redirect to hollywood was in response to an

 i think this is better as it is think of it as a drilldown from the french history template a similar template could provide drilldown for any other period that eventually is covered in comparable detail the idea is that you get detailed coverage on what is closely related and still get the larger sweep of french history

 you have now reverted three times 
 i know and i will continue reverting your vandalism until you stop it 
 okay i didnt realize that stating something like that was such a faux pas i have edited that part out to make it not so blatant could you approve the article now since it does clearly meet wikipedias criteria for notability thanks 
 its all good i decided to let someone else approve or disapprove of it who hasnt reviewed it before it appears as though it was declined sorry 
 sorry for not getting back to you there there was a backlog and i forgot that i pledged not to touch it im so sorry for that mistake and for any harm that it caused

 please see

 alright it seems that my attempt to have this guy banned has failed i requested it twice the first time my request disappeared without a reason and the N nd was denied by the admin stating that is was only a content dispute and not vandalism involving personal attacks he pointed me to the N rr policy and if our friend breaks that policy he can be reported there however not sure if you want to give the banning a shot but meh shrugs 
 for some reason i had a feeling i was familiar with you but yeah i wont bother with that mess at least until the end of this semester i have too much stuff to worry about on that end to be annoyed with the relationship mess hes reedited the article again but i will just wait it out for now shrugs thanks for your help in the matter 
 hello im contacting you because of your involvement with many french articles a few have undertaken the task of anglicising french terms in wiki articles there doesnt seem to have been any discussion about this so your point of view would be welcome i think a good place for this discussion would be the 
 i dont think there has been any real discussion other than some comments made by two people during the initial proposal of the france wikiproject (a copy is available at

 there exists an article on

 its a real labyrinth of changes in portfolio names i notice that the expression ministre du logement apears from N on (see 
 hi arsxeN ne wenger is well known to anyone who follows world football i hope you change your mind 
 yay i knew i could win you over thanks 
 hello i saw you contributed on the 
 marcus although i was responsible for the bulk of the prose of the history of french article (originally on the 
 in connection with the arbitration case you filed i just wanted to be sure that you had seen my comment 
 thanks outside opinions are always appreciated and helpful the rfa might have been more substantial if the other involved parties had said their piece as well cheers 
 personally i strongly oppose the singular as you know i see you have a phd in philosophy that the singular implies unity at least as you suggest in french you may even see that the french wiki which took the very surprising option to name categories by singular terms found out that this choice was a bad idea when they came to speak about religions thus they create the syntaxicallyspeaking absurd category of 
 taz although i can appreciate your desire to deconstruct the categories in order to counteract bias in english the use of the singular religion does not strike me as unnecessarily ideological i would say food in france or wine in france even though there are many wines and kinds of foods and i would have a tendency to say tell me about religion in america without feeling i was unconsciously being a conservative this would be different if the prepositional phrase of france was used the foods of france or wines of france or religions of france would seem more natural you should check out 
 that last distinction clears my understanding problem a classic historical dissertation in french would say les religions en france (if it said la religion en france one would clearly be implicitly asked to question the unity of religion in france ie see debates concerning 
 ps my point was not to disrupt nor to make a political point but to respect the mainstream and official appreciations of religions in france see le ministre des cultes

 phoenix i know about the marvel ub and used it for a while but frankly i thought it looked a little dull thats when i put up my own marvel ub unfortunately the pic which i initially used in my ub which looked awesome was not licensed for use on userpages and so it had to go today when i saw the cap shield i thought id give it a try in the box i just changed the background color in my image box to better fit your shield now if you come up with a cool spidey or marvel or an im with antiregistration or a none are so blind as those who will not see etc ub let me know excelsior 
 ps of course with your inclusion of the marvel ub in your message i am now in the marvel comics cat 
 good talking with you again i notice that you added farmers birthdate i am found many sources with varying birthdates for him when i originally started the article so i think we should change it back to a version with an ambiguous birthdate please respond back here on your talk page 
 i found it on racingreference i know thats not the most accurate source but i figured its better than nothing if you have found many sources please do change it back 
 i changed it back since i had so many disputed sources there is even a section talking about it farmer has a tight lip and is coy in interviews i love what you have been doing about adding the birthdate template and country flag to so many articles 
 thanks it hasnt been easy as you can tell by my edit summaries sometimes 
 i havent been checking your contributions numerous articles have come up on my watchlist 
 i replied to your query at 
 thanks its not exactly the same thing as the citizendium working group watchlist but it is close enough and its an effective tool especially within categories 
 i see that you maintain the portal for france i was thinking it met the requirements for a featured portal and should be submitted for candidacy or at least a peer review but i figured that i should ask you since you would have the most intimate knowledge of the portal would you be interested in pursuing that the only thing i have any concern about is that it might overcover it especially once you get past recent events 
 atropos i agree that the france portal could eventually meet the requirements for featured portal and that as a preliminary step it should go through peer review the only reasons that i havent put it up for peer review so far are because of the time that it requires to respond to and implement peer review suggestions this being said if you are willing to wait a couple of weeks and are available to help it through the process i would be happy to put the france portal up for peer review at that time cheers 
 sounds like a plan 
 you are welcome thats one of the most unpleasant spammers i have encountered in recent memory you should see the lovely email he sent me last night sigh i need to go through and see if those sites are linked elsewhere on wikipedia cheers 
 that was my mistake i was trying to revert to a version prior to another bit of vandalism but in so doing missed that bit i think its back to normal for the moment 
 i just saw your vast contributions to 
 bertsen removing a tag can be done by any user once they feel that the tagged problems have been dealt with although it is usually best to see how the main contributors to the article feel about it before doing so id say we are close to removing the cleanup tag once i get enough footnotes into the stuff i have added so as to avoid new citation needed tags thanks for your contribs 
 i tried looking at this 
 i see you are sleeping hm looks like qui still has you as busy probably it is using the last status it understood or else defaults to busy oh well better than nothing at least it doesnt explode 
 really sleeping is a qui status let me have a look at a nonqui one 
 i still have you as busy try online 
 crazy i still have busy i even tried removing you from the list and readding no idea whats going on i will report it on 
 im getting an issue as well i changed my friends around and some either didnt add or havent removed s 
 i know that your friendslist is cached so if you edited it manually then qui might not have noticed by the same token it apparently can take a little while to update even when changed properly 
 if you want something with custom statuses copy the code from 
 please do let me know where you disagree and thanks for opening up the discussion 
 anyway thats my two cents 
 thanks for responding so quickly you have brought up a good number of things i hadnt thought of i still dont like their being on the list and i may well try to open up a discussion on the talk page regarding what criteria need to be met for inclusion on the list on a side note keep up the fantastic work on france and french literature and especially the N th century i had no idea just how much of it was yours and you probably have no idea just how much people appreciate it 
 thanks for that it is true one never really knows 
 a note on 
 i live in france so i naturally know whats happening i will try to keep the news in order but just give me a nudge if i start forgetting 
 about the news section it looks a bit long to me couldnt we make it more like the main page with short headlines and then read more links to wikinews 
 thanks that would be a great help shorter headlines are fine altough i will have to modify something on the page to avoid having a huge blank area either shortening the dyk and selected article sections or moving the you can help section to the other column

 hi there sorry for the late response in answer to your question i moved the template because i am trying to clean up the large number of single use templates and because its difficult to understand why you need a template when a boxheader could do the job however i cannot figure a way out of the problem of the v or d or e buttons linking to the template instead of the box header i tried with an alternative portal subpage but the v or d or e buttons link to an empty portal i think this is a coding situation within the or maybe for the moment i will request the template be speedily deleted and i will restore it so that there should be no problem with the v or d or e buttons however i will look into some way of adapting the boxheader so that it solves the problem without needing a template 
 i think i ran into the same problems when i was setting it up and the v or d or e buttons and the collapsable nature of those nav boxes were a definite plus hopefully coding will catch up to our needs thanks

 i have found two articles that i believe should have the english translation as the articles name im not too sure about the naming conventions in this case though as i didnt spend a whole lot of time reading it the two articles i found are 
 generally article names should be kept in french if the subject is better know by its french name (like 
 proctorvegas aint that rural at least compared to 
 true that really i could probably leave out rural altogether as its more or less covered by southern ohio unless you include cincy i suppose 
 do we 
 its from an old issue so its not for sale anymore and i dont this will take away from the success of guitar world in any way id say its fair use in one sort or another 
 nope if it was copyrighted when published it is still copyrighted and we cant claim fair use we would need to seek permission to use it or drop it no 
 hmmm can we just put quotes around the whole thing instead it seems they dont mind people copying the list as aboutcom has the same info and thats actually where i got the info from how would we go about obtaining permission 
 so its a copyvio from aboutcom as well check their website and you will see xaN about inc a part of the new york times company all rights reserved you could email guitar world directly and ask them for permission to use it

 nice work cleaning up the relient k articlesagain 
 thanks for the clarification but i think that wikipedias grammar book needs a revision is it is inconsistent all other grammar styles presented on wikipedia go by the following suit rule use american english versus british english in an article on a strictly american topic and otherwise just follow suit throughout an article with one style the quotation section in wikipedias grammar book however mixes american and british quotation use showing a lack on consistency i hope that made sense 
 you have asked for evidence supporting my claim about greatschoolsnet to do that you need only to go to the website and review the material they have available their statistics are drawn from government sources which could be used as primary sources there are in some cases posts from teachers parents and students from the schools but these also cannot be verified in most cases they simply provide statistics without citing a source at all it is impossible then to verify the claims of the website and so it cannot be used as a source on this encyclopedia if you disagree you can ask for mediation in this case from an administrator again i will contact an administrator if you continue to revert my edits thank you 
 instead of constantly reverting my edits to the article which doesnt serve any real purpose you can instead spend your time finding the original sources by and through which greatschoolsnet compiled their data this way the fact tags may be replaced with primary government sources and there will never be a question about verifiability 
 well unfortunately if you continue to insist on reverting those changes you are going to keep hearing about this i have reported your edits to an administrator and i expect some resolution to this matter in the next few days until that happens you are not to remove those fact tags from that article 
 hi sorry about im not sure what i was actually trying to do but it definitely wasnt that 
 you are alright you were just trying to revert vandalism but it went over my edit as well 
 i had the article undeleted it had been speedy deleted you are more uptodate on the current happenings in nascar than i am would you please read buffys article and help me improve or update it also what is her current status at 
 i dont know if you are up to date on

 thanks for starting to help clean this up if you look at the talk page for this article there has been major dramas with a certain user 
 yeah i know i have been watching the page since december N i wont be going pass formatting changes and fixing up the album pages (eg merging 
 still having dramas with references now but hopefully he will get the idea and try to do it a bit better 
 any more attempts at humour will be summarily shot 
 please explain the tag you put on bobbys biography and career section or replace the tag with a more specific tag thanks 
 comparing and the the most notable change is that the text has been split into paragraphs which was one of the reasons for the tag the biography section still needs work mainly it need to be split into 
 i think it looks more professional and is more encyclopedic no featured article would have a list so why should start class article have one (see also 
 i rarely upload album covers i just add the fair use rationales to them you can get the album cover from anywhere on the net it doesnt have to be in high res anywhere between N px is fine in the image description you should include a brief sentence on what the image is of the images source url the copyright holder a fair use rationale and the licensing template see 
 can you offer any suggestions 
 i took the liberty of answering this on rexs discussion page you might have a few more though i hope that wasnt overly intrusive butting into your conversation like that 
 oh dear im afraid that rex did find it intrusive frankly my feelings are a little hurt 
 does a road atlas count as sources i am using a road atlas to see which roads travel through each town in bergen county 
 no reason you cant but be careful that road atlases are often not very reliable in showing municipal boundaries when in doubt check out the straight line diagrams that are used as sources for all of the state and county roads 
 if you are willing please cite for me on my talk page the three most recent edits by me which you feel show unacceptable bush or kerry bias also please explain why you think that on each one i assure you i will consider each one carefully 
 but it is your contention of pov i am concerned with from my vantage point my edits all pass muster 
 hi kollision the george smith or N krayze vandal whose edits you reverted back in september is back putting his selfpromotional crap in 
 update he struck again today editing and i have given him a level N warning and if he makes these edits again i will report him at the administrators noticeboard 
 thats a pretty serious allegation where are you getting this information from 
 ignore my previous message i misread what you wrote 
 a friendly advise dont mess with me as it is to you interests i have currently plenty of time and willingness to squash anyone who messes with me in wikipedia i have done it before and i can do it again two articles have been already protected per my request due to your editing war if you leave me alone i will leave you alone 
 im not cooperated with you and im not leave you alone even though you said so i will accepting your advice 
 its on i advise you to check often every contribution of yours to wikipedia from today on because other editors might check every edit made by you and recklessly rebut your arguments according to wp rules word by word if you keep that aggressive attitude toward fellow editors 
 hello alistair why are you reverting by N with comments like revert advertising by N so far as i can see all of the links this user added are free gpled source code that is directly relevant to the articles in question and likely quite useful to someone researching the subject the remainder of the website in question also appears to be totally noncommercial 
 the policy such as it is is at 
 hah you dont need to defer to me im just another wikipedia editor yes the policy is not a N per cent clear on this there is plenty of grey area imho this one though is safely over the fence i would put them back but its up to you 
 hi i thought id add my N cents i think that for software that supports lots of different algorithms (
 hi im a commons admin and i want to inform you that this image is technically a copyvio as you are not conforming to the ccbysaN licence of the colin greenwood image you need to change the licence from ccbysaN to ccbysaN to conform thanks 
 done 
 i have tried using your script and it appears to blank the talk page prior to adding the template i have tried taking a copy working through it and attempting to fix the problem but no luck is this just me or a general problem 
 bioassessmentjs is waaaayyyy outdated it hasnt been updated since march N which is probably why it doesnt work anymore development stopped because 
 i am truly grateful for this 
 glad to help 
 which was hopelessly wrong my advice is not to revert at all until lightmouse advises whether its possible to tweak the script to translate this error into a proper unlinked equivalent if so he will advise whether its better to revert and then run the script again or whether the script can be reapplied without reverting to correct the error if not the manual option needs to be pursued and since the issue arose from bad syntax in the first place i think its the job of the editors to fix it im glad this has been uncovered thanks for your vigilance 
 my fault script updated in my cache now and works perfectly lightmouse is rolling back and fixing my conntribs from yesterday thanks for your notification 
 hi kollision i see from the talk page for

 hi for some reason my username is blocked although i have an account please help to unblock me thanks 
 sorrybut bluegoblinN is currently on 
 and plus you are not and never was blocked 
 please do not without comment its not immediately obvious why you did that an explanation would be nice 
 woah what i did not do that i dont know how that happened 
 i will add the back then as i believe it is an important fact that needs a source or 
 hi i see you recently edited the ning criticism section there has been a recent flurry of activity that you might want to weigh in on in my opinion there are some 
 hi kollision as you may have noticed the dispute over the 
 congratulations 
 thanks avi uN 
 as you said 
 i dont think it really matters right now until theres an official titles i wont argue with the title percy jackson ( 
 should even be in the article at all shouldnt that be in the 
 hmmm i know what you mean i was thinking that we need to make it directly relevant to internet explorer maybe we could rephrase it a bit as it stands it seems to me a bit incongrous in the article 
 ok but still think about rephrasing it a bit so it doesnt hang around like a bad smell 
 ok sounds fair to me anything that makes the article better i will support you on 
 i want to know how one reports a wp user i think that N should report mertensN for the attack on him or her looking at mertens history hes attacked many people over the years most of the attacks extremely offensive and profane im just wondering thank you 
 could i see some examples of the many attacks that i have made im aware of two possibly three that i have made in the three years i have been editing here so im just curious and i wouldnt consider any of them extremely offensive and profane profane maybe but three profane attacks in three years is hardly enough to ban someone so id like to see a few examples if i could thanks 
 thanks the problem should be fixed 
 much better cheers from canada 
 err i only count N flaws on that list that affect spN 
 interested i just started it do you know anyone else whod be interested 
 do you know 
 hi i wanted to understand this some more i can understand that if we have an article a and N redirects aN aN and N or N of each of the articles that refer to a do so via redir aN then the ranking is split N ways what happens if all the links go direct to a though does it have any effect then thanks 
 well links to redirects dont bother me so much because as you point out a bot can fix them the far bigger problem is people who link to a disambiguation page and never bother to click on their links to see if they really link to the thing they intended to link to a bot cant fix those 
 would you mind explaining your recent edits to pages like 
 simply makes the 
 thanks again 
 other things that could be done to improve the section the film has a budget of $N million i doubt that they made all of that money back so it would be good to find out how much it has made and add that to the article also when talking about ratings from critics instead of saying so and so gave the film a rotten rating read the reviews again to determine their overall opinion then change it to gave the film a positive or negative or mixed review rotten or fresh is a rotten tomatoes thing and the critics did not technically give a rotten or fresh rating also for one of the reviews b minus should be changed to b be careful not to change the meanings of what people say 
 thanks for reviewing my dyk nomination 
 at this point you can just wait it used to be that they would pick from articles that were the oldest and place them on the main page but now it could be tomorrow or two weeks from now in terms of the hook the funkier the better something like in N 
 could you check the spelling of this german guy i am having troubles locating any references as for treecats i replied at 
 gotta love wiki 
 hello ktrN please be aware of your edits about the template in 
 your rationale is exactly why i am correct it is a current event in the month of may so this is completely justified look at other articles to see what i am talking about 
 oh yes it is happening this month of may but we dont need to put that because it is clearly stated at the N philippine general election article that it will happened today so what is the use of putting it 
 categorization purposes that and my obsessive compulsive want for keeping categories that can be small small compels me to take action check the may category and you will see that it has a parent category once june rolls around we will have two subcategories for seven days as they will denote the month i know it seems confusing but it all makes sense eventually 
 yes we can categorized it but not in that way we can easily categorized it by just opening the article in addition the article title to have indicated there that N year mean elections occur this year including the month and date and please dont compare other articles because N philippine general election is different thank you 
 no it isnt every article is categorized the phillipine articles arent any different if we treat it specially then we would be contradicting alot of rules what harm is there in keeping it there anyways i dont see any harm in having a different category and maybe ten extra bytes dont worry about it 
 oh as my observation your right hahahaha sorry for the misunderstanding thanks for correcting me take care god bless 
 hello kollision id like to invite you to join the 
 ha personally i like the color better welcome 
 i figured you should know as your a major contributor to that article and obviously have a good deal of knowledge on the subject 
 thanks mate im going to let the fac run its course then add it to peer review then start work on the article 
 please register an account it is difficult to discuss the issue when your ip address changes regularly 
 hi morphh i removed the tax protester info box from this article i am a member of his church and i know that he is not antitax or antigovernment in fact he tried to pay the tax the government said he owed rather than have the case go to court 
 dear morphh i think editor steve dufour is correct on this point although moon was convicted of tax crime i dont think moon ever made tax protester arguments unless you know something i dont yours 
 anyway thanks again for your advice 
 hi i just saw one of your pictures and realised that it is being used on the french portal for australia http or or frwikipediaorg or wiki or portailaustralie they at the moment are using one of my pictures at the top of the portal check it out

 did you have a reason for removing the screenshot from the article about the film renaissance 
 i wasnt the one that removed it an ip editor at the same time i did not restore the screenshot while restoring the poster the ip also deleted while the poster should clearly stay the screenshot in a little more grey in terms of the 
 my mistake thanks 
 but please provide something about yourself at

 the pages are listed in 
 happy to rewrite article on 
 dude give me a chance that page was up for almost no time at all heck im good humoured but i had to go out i was planning on quite a bit more work now 
 one learns not even heard of thorrington 
 seems authoritative though 
 thank you for updating my vandal count 
 oh thanks for that to 
 hello alistairmcmillan thanks for your work with updating links i am confused though why you changed and mdash 
 thanks for explaining and for fixing all those links i know they are a pain to fix however in my opinion modifying others comments should entail considering what their intention was anyway its a minor issue keep up your good work and mdash 
 dont mind me keep up the good work 
 the answer like all such things is knowing about it now i do i can 
 clockwise from newhaven seems arbitrary 
 at risk of repetition the answer like all such things is knowing about it now i do i can 
 try seems pretty definite also shows a tidal segment of water below the mill one would need to see for sure how it worked before coming to a definite conclusion it may be that this mill is at the tidal divide on the river so has a non tidal head of water from a river rather than a tide refilled pound to power it if that is the case does that make it a tide mill or just a watermill 
 by all means i might email essex cc some day to see if they will admit it that it dont have a tide refilled pound cant today their entire website seems to be down 
 im always happy to be proved wrong i looked though at a large number of articles that i have written or contributed to where you had deployed awb you seem to have hit the lot today for one reason or another again no objection where something required correction while i may be wholly incorrect the blank lines seem to have vanished rather than appeared 
 in that case i dont think you would upset anyone if you just turned the redirect page into a disambiguation page per 
 article names are case sensitive after the first character so if someone searches for or types in icct they wont even know about icct and viceversa what i would consider personally to be the best solution would be to write icct as a disambiguation page make icct redirect to it and then list off every page which would be suitable with the proper capitalization this method is done with various disambig pages such as 
 once written down it is easy to see what to do thank you this gives me good guidance for the future i am heading in to do precisely that thing 
 are you interested i hope to get info on microsoft related topics upN date accurate and presented neutrally 
 speaking of whichi was rather surprised to see this here i thought er yeah the old cliche i thought you were an admin i run into your great edits all over the place we seem to have all the same basic nerdinterests you have been here since N march N and have garnered over N edits are you interested in adminship 
 it is acceptable to cut and paste to do a merge when the page you are moving the text to already exists this problem existed because the wrong redirect was set up in the first place your reasons for reverting this do not address the issue of where the the material on edward irving wortis really belong which is on that page since that is his name with your changes other valid uses of avi will now need to select another link to find what they are looking for i really think that my changes are correct and will be clearly more so in the future as the other avi entries are added so i will ask that you revert your changes we dont want to get into a revert war and its usually better in the long run to have the dab as the name page and not the article unless what is there is clearly the significant use and in this case it is not in my opinion 
 i forgot to add that in a cleanup that i did the most frequent reference to the 
 yes i did a merge and not a move the redirect prevented the move it is acceptable to do a merge as long as you comment that you did this in the description on the changes i did that the edit history is still retained at the old article to meet the gfdu requirements if you are concerned about the history you can request that an admin merge the history to the new page how articles are named here should be based on the standards for this wiki and not based on how many results you get from some other web site if the article should called avi then it probably should be moved to 
 your question about pointing to the edits for the avi redirects they were done a while ago dont know if they were done on my current signin or as an anon user i have too many edits to search through them to try and find this info sorry 
 you said the article itself says the author is better known by his pen name all the links that currently point at the article are all referencing the author noone else the article should be named based on the standard of what do people think the thing or person or object is called what the author is better know as does not mean that it has rights to an article name that is determined by what is the most common useage for that name the fact that links were cleaned up over time is not a reason that can be used to justify keeping something at that place if you look at 
 also look at 
 hi ktrN what is a covered part thanks 
 what is this in reference to 
 ah i know what you are talking about basically in high school we might have a cue to play the part of another instrument since there were so few of us compared to the umass band we just played the parts of others it worked out when your part wasnt the best or the same as everyone elses as well 
 i hope that answers your questions if you need anything else feel free to leave a message on 
 also while the content is not what initially draws me to a particular article i find that i learn a lot about a lot of different things while sorting stubs im glad that i was able to come across your article and learn something from it thanks again 
 please do not edit my user talk page such that some stupid link is made direct it makes it seem as though i have new messages and mdash 
 thats okay is there some benefit to avoiding the redirect i doesnt seem to be an http redirect just a mediawiki thing and mdash 
 please see the reply to your request at 
 knowledge is power jump in and help me research more that way you learn more the topic ould be dull as dull but it bring sup odd little facets of history N of the things is more than one guy can do especially when he has a living to try to earn 
 that sounds absolutely excellent i got involved with this because i once taught kids to sail in the uk at 
 please allow me a few minutes to create the nomination page 
 alistairmcmillan 
 i accept your apology however the only difference between what i said and what was previously said was an issue of semantics since no official statement has been released the expectation is just as speculative as the rumour the only reason to use the word expectation over rumour is that expectation sounds more credible when only the supporting links should affect credibility which i neglected to include so that fault is mine 
 i believe i saw the information on paul thurrotts winsupersite i will try to find it again until updated information from a credible site can be found i agree that we should stick to the source you found 
 sorry about that its not that i think there is anything wrong with the way the article looked before i just came across the article noticed it was in a nonstandard format and set about standardizing it i suggest you have a look at 
 well theres also the 
 the article was written in bullet points which is nonstandard the dates were not present in the first paragraph this too is nonstandard i corrected these aspects of the article i can only reiterate that if you want the standards changed you need to take appropriate action alternatively you can make further amendments to the article yourself to try to achieve a compromise between what the standards say and the effect you are aiming for 
 if you really feel you are complying with this i guess youd better carry on 
 thanks for finding something more suitable than that redirect for 
 i have little better to do when trying to sober up before going asleep other than hit fN on my watchlist and i dont ever expect that vote reciprocated as i could make it to N k edits here and still not be suitable for an admin 
 what you can do is surround your nomination by and and append nomination withdrawn ~~~~ and nbsp 
 that makes sense now being pedantic it actually should be unimportant whether i as proposer withdraw it or not since the matter is effectively up for peer review i think since i have clarified my position on the page afd page there is no sense in following your suggestion this time only 
 well my point is that the majority of people at least on the web use another term its easier to use something like pet door and just move on there is no reason to keep it at cat flap when the ones who use that word seem to be a stark minority 
 it still doesnt matter no nations will be conquered whichever term is used no human rights destriyed 
 if someone somehow still doubts that this organization exists i can arrange for an interview with its founder or its journal editor webmaster and members of this organization who have been to shefas academic conferences 
 i will make a comment on the afd page once i have viewed the article thank you for drawing it to my attention 
 best wishes 
 looking closer i see that todays links are unrelated to the sites being described and just go to a forum which is not being discsussed and is not a 
 thanks for your input the forum link was definitely nonnotable it was really the general issue of how many of those sites need to have a section i might take a closer look later thanks 
 ah ok i went off on a bit of a tangent then yes i think it was still being used as a directory even though some of them didnt have links like i said i removed some of the more obvious ones but have not had an in depth look im sure theres ample more room for improvement 
 i noticed that noone answered your question about closing afd which are unanimous keeps the relevant policy is 
 that makes sense thanks theres a lot to keep in mind 
 no disrespect intended but you gave the originator article all of eight minutes before you sent this for deletion yes it needs cleanup but thats all they have done national tours they are on notable record labels and have recieved reviews in rolling stone i would ask you to reconsider your nomination withdraw it and mark this for cleanup instead and wait more then N minutes next time maybe actually do a google search before you assume bad faith 
 i just dont understand why when faced with such an article a wikipedian like yourself doesnt attempt a cleanup him or herself or at the very least just mark it for cleanup there is a contingent in this community who shoot down music articles on sight and i wish that would change thats what upset me but i like what you had to say on the afd and here so again there was nooooooo disssssrespect 
 it is nothing to do with it beikng a music article i have nothing for or against music articles there is a great difference between seeing an article that yells this is not notable and attempting to clean it up for this article a content expert is required not just an editor what will happen is the correct resolution of this article as i have told you i will revisit it in a couple of days my view will either have changed or be the same depending on what i see afd is not a rushed process in the meantime other community members will also form judgements i hope very much that the article is sufficiently enhanced to survive 
 hi sorry for being a pain but if you want to claim images as fair use you need to list a source wikipediafair use#justification for fair use alistairmcmillan N N september N 
 thanks for the heads up saw your note this morning and went back to the source listed them on each image they were clearly created and released for promotional purposes and noted them as such on the image file thanks 
 are you asking for exact sources in terms of who took that picture and who released it to the commercial or news sites isnt it appropriate to assume that images provided to legitimate commercial sites that are clearly used to promote a movie or tv program are part of the public domain i work in pr we release company materials for appropriate public consumption all the time it would be weird for us to get a call requesting usage rights 
 to be honest i know nothing of the band i think you showed great maturity and openness when you withdrew the nomination you did not have to do that i commend you and i hope our paths cross again best of luck 
 i know nothing of them either but that also meant i was able to judge on evidence not on emotion i have a firm belief that the use of afd should always create a win or win it should alert the creator to the fact that work can be done to save the article and also draw others to it in order to help or if that fails then trash gets deleted if we nominate something we should be prepared to withdraw too this is not the first time i have withdrawn and will not be the last equally i have altered my vote from keep to delete and vice versa in the past we must always judge on the merits of what is before us but that is not always easy to achieve sometimes we get blinded by what is obvious to us thank you for also stepping in and improving the article together we all won i think 
 agreed on every count i have had similar experiences you are going to do well 
 hi i noticed that the claim on the 
 the matter seems solved sorry for the invoncenience it appears that winvi is picked up by many as a name for windows vista 
 noticed that a lot of images are showing up on the result that are in fact used via an image redirect take 
 thanks for the heads up the image scripts are badly in need of an overhaul im hoping to get to them next month 
 done the redirect issue is taken care of 
 thank you 
 a pleasure my objective is that wikipedia is always becoming better individual articles simply need to be worth having 
 anyway whats my next step to get the article moved already can i do anything to speed up the move other than just sit and wait 
 thanks for your work wrt when the name was changed have you seen 
 on the afd noms for 
 if you are to be a regualr editor to wikipedia it is worth getting your own log in 
 you may wish to add your voice to the consensus 
 thanks for adding your support he appears hes going to refuse to give in until we have him permanently banned his job at on is promotion of the site can you help me keep an eye on him and his contributions and make sure on links dont get added all over the place i will probably have to take it through formal dispute resolution unless he makes the need for an immediate block obvious thanks 
 again i understand the suspicion but i dont understand the rationale and the crusade to have every entry i have made deleted i do sincerely believe the entries i made had no bias no advertising and no sort of advertisial speak i specifically intended to stray away from that and i thought i succedded and upon looking through the entries i think i accomplished that does the guiltiness lie in the fact that i made all of the entires within a small timespan 
 just two the other editor has removed a category from multiple pages one or the other of us is right probably 
 ok just post a link to the problem and say that the dispute is over the removal of categoryies from N pages no accusations pleaseuN uN 
 to be N per cent clear should i point to an arbitrary page state the category that has been rmeoved stae that it has happened to multiple pages and that the two editors concerned have been in discussion on ones talk page and then simply retire and await an opinion i agree heartily about no accusations this is about the articles not personailities im just concerned to get it right without burdening the submisson page 
 this is no longer a rumor it has been confirmed as fact by the bbc they are a content partner for it per their own admission unless the bbc is in the habit of lying you are dead wrong please refrain from further reverts 
 bbc pulled it down two hours after placing it up because they were jeapordizing their relationship with apple by having it up its premature placement on the web was a mistake but that doesnt negate the fact they did put it up and confirmed it during those two hours 
 holdon uN uN 
 you cannot file an rfc without N other users posting comments on that users talk page uN uN 
 after the advice yesterday in the irc channel i have filed 
 yup i have accepted your mediation request id like to discuss this on my talk page but any other medium works if you would prefer it thanks for using medcab 
 thank you i am happy with all repsonses and discussion being on your talk page 
 hi tim i hope you dont mind me messing around with the template i adjusted the code to allow the county categories to be included too actually my main reasoning was so the lists in the king georges field category would be classified under the first letter of their county rather than under l for list however as i plodded throught the changes i noticed two oddities your choice for greater london over london while correct leads to the problem that there is no greater london category i left it as london for now i was surprised you had the two usages of avon too while i realise that avon was the original county when the fields were inorgorated i dont understand why they would still be classified as being in avon shouldnt this just be a footnote or not even mention at all 
 with respect to you disagreement with categorization i might be unclear on what you were trying to do i think you had added a the kgvf category to each town that had a kgvf personally i think this is probably a bad idea since towns will have too many categories if such a style is used it would seem more sensible to write a generic paragraph linking to the main article on kgvfs and add that to each town under their sport facilities or leisure facilities subheading if you wish to have all the towns together an extension of your list would seem to make more sense you currently have the counties listed you might then have an indent and list the towns for each county what do you think of that 
 avon i will sort outand the others i am in process of renaming 
 do you think this or something similar would be useful i will think more on the categories vs list 
 i think this is an excellent concept can it be incorporated automatically somehow into the kgvf template i am somewhat of a novice in these matters 
 that should be no problem 
 i just noticed that you have categorised all the county lists in the 
 each individual field is constituted as a charity even if it is as small as a couple of acres this was done in order to seek to guarantee each fields use in perpetuity as a place of recreation however the king georges fields article itself refers to many charities rather than being a charity itself i think you are right that the list of lists should be categorised as a charity i am now unsure about the main article giving details of the history of the fields as a whole interested in your opinion a second head as we always see brings clarity of thought 
 wow that is a complicated mess so technically each field should be added to the uk charity category however i do bulk at the idea of doing this from the perspective of having so many fields in that category in a way by categorising the county lists you are already half way between having the one master list at one extreme compared to having every field at the other in this respect i think simplifying to one entry as the master list might be the best choice im certainly not going to revert your work just throwing out some food for thought 
 this is why i have added the lists per se as charities because they are effectively lists of charities as well as of locations with fields the whole area is one large anomaly my challenge is that while it is certainly notable it is also minority interest were this N it would be in the forefront of every uk editors mind but this is a few years later im giving this whole area substantial thought prior to continuing im just rather sad that a wholly unrelated category 
 wording like major positive influence in the uk and beyond is not appropriate for a professional encyclopedia major is akin to very extremely and other impossibletoquantify qualifiers in the uk and beyond where else exactly why isnt he mentioned this is 
 thank you i think we can solve that easily enough i think you will find noone writes professionally for wikipedia btw but i take your point happily 
 and thank you no worries you are good 
 they are not common the article is not named 
 i disagree with you and that is one virtue of wikipedia we may disagree as you see the prod has rules which you are wholly at liberty to follow if you can assert notability sufficient to show me that you are correct i will form a different view if you simply remove the prod without convincing me i will nominate it for peer review at articles for deletion where it will meet strong peer scrutiny and may survive or may be deleted i am content with either outcome since it is by consensus if you feel strongly that it should remain i advise substantial improvement including citations as the article stands i am afraid i do not view it as meeting the criteria for inclusion 
 by the way a common misconception is that one article serves as a precedent for other articles this is absolutely not the case every article on wikipedia is an individual entity that must stand up to community scrutiny on its own merits while it is always interesting to see other articles there is the danger that they will then have their own weaknesses exposed 
 d your argumentation for the squeaky rat prod is substanceless 
 i have not threatened you there is nothing threatening in my tone i have stated simply and clearly that i believe these articles are not in keeping with wikipedia whoever removes the prod unless the articles themselves assert notiability i or others will nominate them 
 i always 
 congratulations on your N th edit all you need is N more to get to N edits you told me about that user with that many edits i made a little over N edits on april which is the most edits i made a month im slow at reverting vandalism can you teach me some tricks i have to copy and paste the warnings which takes a long time is there a faster way of doing it 
 wow you are have contributed tirelessly to wikipedia good work 
 i have rarely seen him but i remember him from his rfa 
 hello i am a student at montana state university and one of my classes is native american studies for a project we are working with wikipedia and will be working on editing or adding to current articles dealing with the study of indian law and policy part of the requirements is that we pick someone that has experience in the world of wiki i saw your pic and read your small intro about yourself and was wondering if you would be willing to work with me as an online mentor with editing documents and such i have used wikipedea before but never to this depth let me know if this will work for youi am sure you have a pretty busy life 
 yes i would be more than willing to work with you although indian law and policy is not something that i am presently familiar with i would be willing to work with you on it just let me know what you need help with as i should be able to get back to you rather quickly assuming i am not sleeping 
 i do not know any policy on transient fripperies further i would like to refer to 
 why would there be a policy on those words per se the words i used signify that the subjects of the articles and the categories you created for them are in my opinion so lacking in importance that they will never ever meet any of the criteria for notability set out in 
 i am the dna of bionictest but can you make me as a staff so that i can gain control of the wikiit has been idle 
 yybo i perceive it like you just do not like halloween squeaky rats etc and thus you argue with low significance at least animated coffin has evidence on the internet though haunters are a special population group wikipedia does not include statements to exclude minorities to flavour the mainstream 
 you are perfectly correct wikipedia is not censored i fail to see what you are talking about with the nomination fails wpnot an indiscriminate collection of information if this belongs anywhere at all it belongs in wiktionary but is a non notable dicdef 
 i believe it is expandable how about external links into wikitionary i do not believe cyberhauntcom is nonnoteable and it is not the only site about halloween yards 
 you must do as you see fit however you have stated that you will not read an excellent treatise on notability and you do not seem to be making practical use of 
 hang on i wrote i will read it if it gets tagged with an essay template like other user essays i already have read it though not completely 
 i should have been clearer since i very much doubt that this will be tagged i thus very much doubt that you will read it i apologise for any misrepresentation of your views nonetheless i feel it to be a mistaken stance that you state you are taking 
 if it becomes a wikipedia article then it needs to be tagged tuna or not tuna to my knowledge 
 ok enough of this i perceive this behaviour of yours is being exhibited simply to exasperate and will take no further part in conversations over these articles or about notability with you tuna is irrelevant here the article is patently on a user page as you can see clearly if you reply please expect no further replies from me 
 also the japanese templates neednt be formatted the little question mark is used instead of the usual j url 
 hey thanks for the backup and barnstar you can go ahead and add the soundtracks if you want to i dont mind ~ 
 alistair sorry to bother you with this but i just noticed you blocked dbiv even though you were involved in the content dispute thats a violation of the blocking policy so it might be best if you were to unblock him and let an uninvolved admin handle it message for you about it at 
 hi again i have only just started editing the article so i dont know the issues or who is taking which side all i know is that we are not allowed to block people we are having content disputes with so regardless of the consequences you should really unblock him for your own sake as much as anything else another admin is likely to come along and reblock if it was a genuine violation 
 we should really have this discussion on the N rr page so im going to move the comments there by for your own sake i meant that you have violated the blocking policy which is regarded as a serious offence for an admin particularly in the current climate as there have been a couple of recent controversial instances of it youd therefore be doing yourself a favor if you were to unblock and perhaps ask an uninvolved admin to look at the situation 
 alistair you have only undone the autoblock you havent unblocked the account yet could you do that please 
 sure i can take you on as i am pretty competent in this aspect of politics just tell me what you need and i will try to see what i can do for you 
 personally i would like to see the graphs first because you might be able to find the information and create your own graphs thus skirting any potential copyright violations as you are the one who made it i also noticed on the article that you removed a broken link this is fine but you also might want to check out in the future so that you will be able to see old pages that no longer might be up it is a really neat site and really works wonders when you need it the only downside is that some sites wont allow their pages to be archived the link that you removed though doesnt even show up in the archive so you are doing quite well for starters keep up the good work 
 why should it be it is on a user sub page 
 it made an impression like being a new policy or someone trying to use own arguments like if they are official policy N i have researched some similar essays use the template any reason why uncleg is not displaying the template i never wrote his arguments are wrong if he adds the template i can read the complete essay 
 since he has no reason whatsoever to place that on the top of the article precisley because it is a user page and ipso facto his own opinion and an essay the point you make is wholly irrelevant but by taking the attitude you state you are taking you are depriving yourself of excellent information which you really should consider properly it is your right not to read it naturally but the attitude you are displayimg ill becomes you as a mature editor 
 please keep in mind 
 seconded 
 thirded 
 thanks for apologizing i know it aint always easy 
 i was actually trying to take the piss but never mind 
 ditto jocko appreciate your falling for it 
 hi i created a bunch of surname articles so you are recent actions are popping up on my watchlist the surname is generally useless (see my discussion initiation you also destubb and i dont know why but i wouldnt really have a problem with what you are doing if not for the creation of redundant cats you see automatically puts the article into 
 responded on my talk 
 responded at 
 thanks 
 i know that this 
 i created a new section about conventional name in talkkorea under japanese rule 
 because it was wrong edit of course japanese user edit not proper im just conform to article forms 
 thanks for cleaning up that blair waldorf good article issue simply overlooked that 
 you are welcome it doesnt really matter too much its just that some reviewers check under topic sections that they are particularly interested in to choose an article to review 
 ps i notice that royalist is not mentioned in the 
 thanks des that seems to have done the trick 
 to be fair i havent tried it in any other browser but it doesnt display at the top in the way i think you intended instead text overlays text and looks interesting 
 my useragent mozilla or N gecko or N firefox or N i have also tested it in konqueror and opera for linux mind taking a screenshot for me cheers 
 easy as winking no wuckers mate how would you like it delivered 
 gmail thanks take a stab in the dark at what username is by the way whats your useragent thanks 
 darkened stab happening gmail delivering with useragent details 
 please do this in the future instead of blanking the entier article blank the section i know processing copyrights is a stressfull thing and i sympathise with it just a little care will make wikipedia a better place tho thank you 
 no harm done i actualy located the image on a mirror and reuploaded thank you for your time 
 i may be offline for a while so please do not interpret my lack of an additional response as a snub 
 thanks for the note with these various halloween articles my feeling is that this one should survive but that it needs to be taken in hand and given more than just a makeover that together with the challenges i and others are having in communicating with the originator of the many articles is the reason why i feel this should be played out in public rather than any editor simply being bold we may never agree over the matter but that in itself is not important what is important is that we act with consensus and for the greater good i have responded on the articles talk page but wanted to give you a more personal answer here 
 thanks tim i have placed my response on the articles talk page 
 although we disagree i do appreciate your civility i am going to remove the templates and if there is not improvement in the article after halloween and you reinstall them please consider using the more simplified title of list of halloween traditions thanks 
 hi you removed a link from http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlehierarchical_file_system and curidN and diffN and oldidN with the comment of it being a dupe why is that yes there are implicit refs to the hfs+ page inside the text but the purpose of this explicit link in the see also section was so that it was easy to see after all thats what a see also is about to give an overview of further information on that topic isnt it 
 i share tempels feeling that especially in long articles the see also section is very helpful to point the interested reader to related items while the wikilink inside the article serves another independant purpose developing an argument building on your extremely rich experience with edits in the five digits going beyond the statement normal practice is would be most sincerely welcome

 my website is different for many reasons it is on an actual website and not a forum the guide is very easy and provides different quality oprtions my guie des not use the nowillegal dvd decrypter i can be contacted at anytime and my average response time for support quesions is about N hours and that i put my heart and soul into my website i spent endless hours handcodin html for people all across he world i have had visitors from all N continents excpt antarctica and besides why is it in your power to queston me 
 i read the page and said usually do not i understand the definiton of the word usually i also understand that i have something to give to the ipod community and that people should know about it if you could just put a link no desciption needed at the bottom of the external links section it would be greatly appreciated and this can be all over 
 why you have not added speedy deletion to the redirect pages obviously they are not really required i will not vote for the afd though i do not believe the articles should have been grouped together whatever happens i will create a request for 
 i recognize nominating the weakest article for a group afd the argumentation or does not apply for 
 i am really not interested in pursuing this discussion with you here if you wish to comment then do it on the afd page 
 i want to make the article more like 
 i would support a comparison table if i thought we had authoritative sources on these classes but as far as i know we do not the classes listed on this page are pretty much all classes where a starship was mentioned once in dialogue or a starship appeared once in a listing on a monitor for x number of frames as far as i know we dont have authoritative sources on them so it ends up with people constantly correcting the statistics one way or the other depending on some fan noncanon source 
 there are piblished wikipedia encyclopedias that have comparasion charts as well as technical drawings i do not know if but if it is it can be very useful in creating a comparasion chart 
 this is another chart again i am not certain if it is cannon but it does look like those technical drawings we see on various star trek publications 
 the two images you linked to are based on fans extrapolating figures as best as they can i have done my best to derive reasonable figures though 
 fine how about using the technical manuals you mentioned on the talk page of enterprise d for the comparasion i reliase there may be inconsistencies but we can have two columns one for dsN and one for tng 
 great then another column for the star trek encyclopedia for when it contradicts the technical manuals another column for actual series dialogue when it contradicts the manuals and the encyclopedia and another column for production staff who designed the ships for when they contradicted the manuals the encyclopedia and the series dialogue you see where this is going right and this is just the galaxy class if you dont believe me then take some time to read through sites like exastrisscientiaorg please believe me there are no consistent sets of specs for the starships in star trek 
 yes an excelently informative article comparing the technical manuals and roughly copares the ship if you do not want to assist i can understand that but i think we have material to cover we can leave out fannon no problem and stick to cannon and semi cannon sources 
 you are not listening to me there are no authoritative sources for statistics on even the ships that we saw regularly the few sources we have for these statistics all contradict each other then you have the ships that only appeared in a single episode or were only mentioned in passing in dialogue there is nothing useful that can be said about them that doesnt stray into fanon or speculation 
 you are right i am not listening do you know where can i aquire data on star trek tech manuals online 
 thank you very much for commenting on my photo at peer review i replied to your points and i also uploaded several other version at 
 no worries additional comments added 
 i must ask you to refrain from the usge of the label our mutual friend i must ask strongly to refrain from it reference talk page of user david d policies applying 
 you know i think you have misunderstood i see people i meet here as friends david d and i each tried very hard to assist you with the various articles and each did it in a friendly manner thus friend is appropriate we did it separately and also together hence mutual is appropriate the term is civil not in any way disparaging and i had not expected it to cause any offence of any description since it has obviously caused you offence i apologise but have no idea what offended you do please read policies before quoting them though talk pages are not required to be neutral especially user talk pages 
 good for you i would like to be other editors friend if possible have a look 
 thank you i posted on alisons talk page i was reluctant to contact the user as i really dont know if it is against policy and do not want to accuse someone of something they think is harmless i dont think it is harmless though so wanted a more experienced users opinion on how to go about this thanks 
 my opinion is that it is harmless anybody with even a simple understanding of the function will recognize it is either a a mistake b a joke or c ignorance neither of which are against policy 
 thanks for responding to this 
 no problem my personal guess is that the editor does not truly understand what it is and how it works the test key N to me implies a test and no negative intent if it was an actual malformed hexadecimal code with invalid characters i would be more likley to imply sinister intent i dropped a note on their talk page offering to help fix it 
 honestly folks its no problem it seems that chris has the right grasp of the issue here as it seems to be just a new editor whos trying very hard to fit in committed identities on wikipedia have a very clearly defined purpose and its pretty obvious that this one is unlikely to be ever needed best thing would be to ask the editor in question and maybe offer a helping hand 
 now i believe to be an appropriate response here 
 its okay i know that chrislkN had already posted a message on their talk page i was unsure of how to go about this which was why i asked riana for help i wasnt expecting this problem to happen 
 now that all comments have been addressed on this article is there anything else that needs to be done or do you think that its ready for fac if so i will be happy to bring it there or if you think its better you or one of the other reviewers can do it im putting a similar note on the their talk pages too again thanks for all your help and generosity 
 i have left a little final checklist on the article talk page 
 you are awesome 
 thanks you are too 
 do not forget to investigate 
 please read and understand 
 do you want to discuss the changes yyyyyyyyyyy and i had already worked out that numbering system to differentiate which series the episodes belonged to and also to put them in order did we violate some sort of convention in doing that i think we need some way of differentiating the two series maybe two categories 
 ok looking at other categories of episodes doing it by alphabet is the standard my apologies but we still need to differentiate by series 
 alright i will change it to two categories then i will do it later today when i dont have school work to do 
 ok i moved all the episodes into subcategories but whats the plan with the miniseries and the film they are not technically episodes so should they come off that category 
 that was an axidant due to an edit conflict and i did remove it very quickly and changed it off 
 i am copying this back to your own talk page as you see i reply where i start the converstaion 
 i believe that this image is of emma and so does the british library i have posted a full explanation at the talk page by the way you made some good solid contributions in the last several months im always glad to see anyone with medieval interests 
 thank you both for the help and for the compliment both are appreciated i am an amateur at the anglosaxon material but im enjoying myself and im glad to hear im managing a decent level of quality thanks 
 just a quick note to say i agree on the splitting and starting over may be a good idea id like to suggest moving the whole wtc over into the new article also a suggestion for the title controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the world trade center anyway thanks for being bold on this 
 im really just looking at this as a practical exercise in good editing practice its too long it needs a real split the current split was incomplete thus we have total confusion so we have to go back to basics or we will lose the plot 
 i take it you are going to do this 
 not i the procedural mistake was in splitting the split text out but also in leaving it behind thus we had twin articles with identical content one in a section the other as the entire article the original spliiting editor did a half job i have no particular skill in this article so i am not the editor to split it out it needs someone with an involvement in the article itself to handle it 
 okay how do i do this cut out the wtc section and open a new page what about the stilltobedeletedornot article rename it redirect is there anything i will need to contact an admin about 
 before you act i suggest you find and read the wp guidance on splitting articles and where it differs from my advice to follow it 
 oops impatience got the better of me but at least we will have seen how could have looked i have followed most of your advice however except for the waiting part 
 i wish you the very best of luck glad at least some of my advice was helpful 
 i do belive my posting fit the criteria 
 your post to 
 where exactly 
 are you wanting me to point you to a galactica discussion board if so then http or or mboardscificom or postlistphpcat and boardbattlestargalactica 
 thankyou 
 hello i noticed in you placed a user is blocked template on the user page after i had already deleted the user page well just so you know you dont have to place an tag on a user page if the user page was a redlink to start with you see that template puts user pages in 
 thats a good explanation however sometimes its best to leave the user page blank to avoid giving the disruptive user any acknowledgement other than a block 
 i share a similar position to you and also find the situation troubling it is likely to be so for the forseeable future as it is an extremely emotive subject for many people simply raising it on a public forum is good as it at least creates an awareness and may attract some new and disinterested participants you might raise your concerns elsewhere perhaps 
 indeed it is the nature of the territory you might want to examine this as an example 
 it happens with various contentious subjects and can often happen with very trivial matters thats just the way it is 
 i think the same size would be about right but what is the explanation of 
 thank you for you contribution to 
 you are welcome 
 could you eplain to me the definition of fork and split and #N and nbsp 
 i hope that helps somewhat i can never find the wp definitions when i need them 
 thanks a lot very clear indeed and #N and nbsp 
 how about a compromise one link to lindos per article if you like and no mention of lindos in any link as it appears on wikipedia (as i have largely done on 
 lastly the normal procedure for situations like this is listed on 
 after N years in the field i now despair at the way things are going backwards with myth replacing reality in so many things concerned with audio chris agrees and lindos is very much our vehicle for trying to educate both professionals and the public back to a proper understanding i do research in buildings in the groounds of my home some of which feeds into lindos i never liked business and always enjoyed the r and d that is why it is particulary sad that the test sheet database results cannot be used here to demonstrate the reality of audio yes most of the entries are currently by chris and myself but that is because it has not been going long i thought of including test sheets in articles but that does not seem nice with lindos on the top to me it seems better to link to them i hate advertising i wonder if links in the form of citations in the text would be acceptable i could say something like the ipod performed well in independant tests with a citation link added would you consider that acceptable as far as i can see the rules support that though you might still say i am linking to a site that i have interest in i am in a peculiar position if i cannot refer to things i was involvded in because there are only a few people in the world heading the development of test methods for audio and i am the only one specialising in subjectively valid test methods despite having to fight a hard battle in the face of an industry run by spec writers who tell lies as part of their marketing so inevitably it all comes back to me if i leave it for others to write the job will not be so well done any further thoughts 
 a cursory look at your contributions indicates you may be in the running for adminship if you are interested we can discuss this further you will need to enable your email also 
 its kind of you to say that at present i dont feel it is a role i want primarily because i feel it requires a commitment i dont feel able to give at present my working life is fluid with huge tranches of time i cant use for anything other than work and then gaps between contracts and i think consistent availability is too important 
 admins like all other editors are allowed to take wikibreaks so its not a bar but obviously it must be your choice on the matter 
 i know its not a bar may i suggest i take a raincheck on the thought for N months or so i have not really been here long enough and though i am assertive in my statements and even right some of the time do not yet have sufficient experience except of course where i do 
 on second thought or inspection i have removed deletion request or nomination i do however think a huge amount of vandalism comes from the shared ip address at that college and the page is often vandalised i suggest a lock how can i do this or suggest this without messing up again thanks 
 why on earth do you think you messed up you did what you thought was right it did the job and wikipedia solved any shortfall the main thing is that you were bold and did what you thought was right you damaged nothing and all works well all this and you learnt some new skills too 
 hi i have continued the discussion on 
 i can take a look with pleasure but i have no idea what you are talking about are you sure you mean me 
 hi ff thanks for your support yes i try to remain calm and i definitely think we need to look at this as a project of some kind i think we can get the article down in size and especially reduce the amount of references im hoping we can get a consensus established to that end but that looks easier said than done right now another thing we will need to do is distinguish controversial from uncontroversial facts what im really worried about is the prose that it is going to held together with what they claim are some believe reports of allegedly suspicious indications of possible evidence that the hypothesis has an outside chance of being likely etc we need to confine ourselves to information that can be presented in prose like a windowpane cheers 
 i hope that may give you some help in seeking to ensure that it does not become an afd target so easily again 
 hi timtrent just stopping by to say i like your signature nothing important uN 
 er thank you 
 sounds good to me we can always focus the message as the project progresses nice to have you working on the article 
 well more standing on the sidelines and shouting encouragement i see the article as important but have not the skill in editing this huge and weighty piece to do more than assist quietly 
 uN 
 i see you got it through great job 
 thanks this must be some sort of record considering one of the ones above took a whole month before it went through 
 userpage you seem to work on some good subjects 
 i can devote some limited time to it please link the project here and i will take a look my intetest in that period was really created by a casual visit to 
 i will set it up i just need some suggestions on a name for it and other things 
 i reinstated the list of other products at 
 if you want to change the see also list to explain how they have influenced microsofts version i will wholely support it as the list stands right now it doesnt tell us anything about microsoft gadgets 
 i can see the argument for removing the list and replacing it with a discussion of the impact of various widget engines but i can see no reason for removing it and replacing it with nothing at all the articles short enough as it is it may not be the perfect way to introduce readers to other related topics but perfection is hard to attain for an article that is about an yetunreleased product 
 please read 
 i dont think our users seriously expect that level of verifiability on such topics either but that gets into questions of general policy which are probably better discussed 
 please outline the so much work this template has caused it was an optional template you could have removed it from your favorite talk page if you felt it belittled your important edit war 
 only divisive to those who need a reminding about trivial edit warring 
 i will also be bring this up during mediation as evidence of bad faith on your part as i repsonded to your comment about this previously to which you ignored you are bring up points that you have refused to discuss 
 please stop trying to get off point i responded to your statement notified you and waited for a reply you gave none if you arent going to reply to a rebuttle against your statement then the statement is pretty much void 
 oh and i have been counting three people voiced their opinions malber sam blanning and you malber made a completely unexplained statement to which he refused to explain when i asked him to you removed the complaint from 
 i saw your post on werdnas talk page and i figured id let you know that he appears to be on indefinite wikibreak so its unknown whether werdnabot will be fixed in the future as it is currently indefinately blocked due to the malfuctions that took place just though id let you know cheers 
 thanks well i guess a N year old is allowed to do what N year olds do pity since that thing was more than useful 
 or for offering your opinion at 
 as it stood the article had to go because it was not about mrs klausutis except in the broadest sense had it been the klausutis scandal or a better title it would have been approriate to keep 
 we have recieved an email on wikimedia otrs granting permission to use material at http or or wwwplayingfieldscom as public domain with reference to 
 i think i have already tagged them correctly but welcome further advice to ensure that any irregularities are ironed out 
 okay i have tagged it with the proper information and the otrs ticket number which is used for these cases uN 
 excellent thank you glad i got my part correct and that the system works one question the text articles should they be tagged as well in case anyone slaps a copyvio on them they are most assuredly part of the same release 
 if there are parts copied then yes uN 
 there are major parts there they were released under the same authority i imagine that it needs you as an admin to tag them rather than me as a contributor currently each article is flagged with a mechansim showing the fully attributed portion id appreciate your tagging them please 
 in order to protect the articles from any accusation of copyvio i have though not on the authorised list added the tag to the article talk pages i would appreciate your checking and validation of my actions to ensure that we have the articles correctly tagged i suppose i should not have been the one to do it but equally i took your comments above as a pseudoinstruction to proceed maybe i should have waited for you if so i apologise 
 yes thats fine uN 
 hi im asking this here because you are the admin i have had the most interaction with since we have clashed on articles in the past i need a bit of wisdom on how i handled a situation on wikipedia wheres the appropriate place to ask heres what happened i stumbled across an article that was advertising copy i think it was 
 thanks for having a look i think maybe i shouldnt have responded to the wireshark accusation other than denying it pointing out he was a peek developer was probably unnecessary since its pretty obvious but i think i learned something from that 
 please remember to source your edits 
 thanks im autowatching the pages i edit wouldnt it be nice if the people who wrote this originally used proper references instead of external links 
 i agree with your views on unprotection left with steelN you may be interested in my 
 precisely the odd attitudes that pervade here are one of the reasons i am wikibreaking i find the principle of wikipedia excllent but the practice is in some cases wrecked by those who are not discriminating between knowledge of the rules and pragmatism 
 im done adding all the lighthouses in israel on rowletts list thanks for the help 
 it goes both ways i wrote 
 please note the biography of the author of the book in particular 
 the article did not assert that importance importance by implication is not acceptable i am aware that it is a book by an imporant scholar but that does not make it an important book the tag needs to remain until the article asserts the importance 
 i see you have enhanced the article to me it is the wrong side of the border of importance still but i am not going to argue over it we simply hold different views it is now at least a valid stub just about it needs far more to be a worthy article 
 sorry i can see that you are trying to be helpful but arent our rules about 
 hi id never seen that page before nor heard of there being a rule of not linking to your own documents as the page is just a mirror of the original mactopia download page there are no npov issues and i see you have chosen to leave the links in place which i take as neutral editor support for them however in future i will suggest my links on the talk page and leave it to someone else to add thanks for the notification i have linked to a couple of other documents on my own server for instance a sample mif file for my article on 
 i had a look at the page but sorry to say this is way outside my knowledge so an expert eye will have to be somebody elses sorry 
 shame but thanks for looking we have what seems to be an intractable issue there currently 
 please see 
 i appreciate your point i didnt think i was coming even close to biting anyone though i suppose you may be referring to my objection to beimng addressed with look pal but i do object to that my style has always been to respond with infinite patience and politeness and to seek to educate i will take several steps back i had already decided to ignore the gentleman after my post in the article talk page don quixote does not suit me i think we need to get the article to peer review very soon indeed though 
 thanks good luck with the peer review 
 i am hoping to persuade someone who has been fully involved to take it to peer review i have always been looking at it as an article not as a magnum opus and i think the responsiblity of submitting it should go to an editor whos interest is the topic 
 then what is this comment doing here 
 tom makes a valid point one does not always interpret ones own words as others see them he has looked at what i have written and drawn a conclusion thats perfectly fine thank you for your support he is supportive too you know 
 of course dont bite the newbies is always a valid point but when i see something that looks unbalanced i then react i think that tom wont mind my snappy comment we both often put efforts to balance each others comments 
 its generous of you to say so i thought your opening it up with pattern poetry was great we will have to do it again sometime 
 thanks your gambit was great too concept was my only weapon as the language could be not if inspiration comes it might happen again fiddle faddle im sure you would be a fair judge or a dangerous contestant 
 you should use haikuthose will show what skill you have dangerous am i 
 consider it 
 wow 
 i gather you got permission for this image by emailing the father when i closed the afd on her i did take under advisory that we inferred the father would approve but if he directly approves id be interested in knowing thanks 
 yes i wrote the permission on 
 nice work people seem to be generally willing to contribute images like this its a shame more people are trying to obtain them 
 okay thanks id frankly debated whether to email him and just ask him how he felt about an article but hadnt gotten around to it i often wonder how most people who have bios feel about them a couple of my colleages do and i have spoken to 
 you have done some great work on that article well done and thanks 
 thanks for any feedback and for your work on the article 
 does that help you understand where i am coming from did i even answer your questions 
 thank you of course it helps and you have answered exactly to what i was asking of 
 always remember that the most surprising things are explosive in the right circumstances and that the term explosive covers everythkng from slow burn items like gunpowder to rather faster things like nuclear explosives flour is explosive in the right circumstances and caused the demolition of many flour mills my point that we will never know after all who knows what was stored on floor N and what happens when it combined with the stuff on floor N 
 molten metal isnt the only reason i tend towards cd explanation cias dirty lanundry moneybusinesspolitcsintelligence mixture and motivecircumstances are among main others conspiracies are a fact blackops do happen around the world thats where im coming from although it might be a factor that i live more to the east in postcommunist country hmmm 
 our background has a huge influence on our outlook the truly great thing is that we may each believe what we will yet we can cooperate to edit an article that is npov governments are crazy as are intelligence services dont get me started on the alleged plot to use tatp to take airliners out of the sky in the summer for me that is a total fabrication of reality precisely because this explosive is almost impossible to manufactue in flight but we will never know the truth there either 
 your opinion on tatp plot made me focus on your statement so i base my gut instinct on the fact that i cannot believe that anyone could have coordinated this thing i wouldnt underestimate human capabilities given good things which people are able to organize i wouldnt exclude bad ones of similiar breadth and as 
 it comes down to scale really it does not take much effort to find a group of likely suspects and create a tatp alleged plot for them to be fair pretty much any fool could also crash a plane into a building but for me the similarity ends there because the resopurcing difficulty starts there it takes huge resources to demolish a building and this demolished more than one those resources have to be deployed over time and they are hard to conceal they require delivery of substantial quantities of stuff and coordinated effort to distribute to the right floor and it has to go bang at the right time 
 i dont think it would take huge ppl resources good access to the buildings as for a construction team for the time of N months should suffice imho possibilities of such operation were described here and well we could be discussing like this for a loong time i suppose that we agree on this one thing if you were to decide you would support a new independent investigation right 
 were a genuinely impartial fresh investigation to be possible i would support it however i would also have to declare that i would agree with its findings this is very similar to the recent new report on the death of diana and el fayed though ones heart will always rule ones head 
 would you do me a favor and look at the roxbury wisconsin article id appreciate any comments or suggestions you have for it i think i have exhausted every last resource available on the town both on and off the web but i certainly could have missed something 
 in what respect would you like me to look at the article are you thinking about attempting 
 i wasnt thinking ga but it is listed as a stub now and could use reassessment anything and everything else could use a good look thanks 
 i reassessed and proofread the article it probably has the best history section of any town in wisconsin i assessed as c class because there are areas that could use significant improvement to be a good article its getting close to b class check out 
 there are a lot of sections that articles on urban areas have that i think are totally inappropriate for an unincorporated area such as climate economy neighborhoods parks and recreation sports media why because they are nonexistent how can you write about something that doesnt exist in roxbury there are no no schools no neighborhoods no parks no recreational facilities no businesses except the ones already mentioned in the article no sports no newspapers no tv stations no cultural life no annual events there is just the hamlet which was mentioned and farms i looked over articles on rural areas in wisconsin and i couldnt find any that had more than the basic cookie cutter geography and demographics sections if you can you find me an example of a rural town or township article with sections such as in the denver article id appreciate it otherwise im through with the article thanks for your edits 
 sounds good you are through and the article is in much better shape for your effort you are right about the other town articles in wisconsin being cookie cutter they were done many years ago by a 
 was there any reason you decided to revert my edits 
 sorry but i reverted your edits because opendarwinorg was founded by apple and the isc the operating system is just one project that was hosted by opendarwinorg 
 no problem i was just curious 
 hi tim just a quick note of thanks for all your work on the cd article i have been having a hard time keeping up with the pace of changes but i will do my best to pull my weight from now on 
 the work and the credit for it is really down to those like you who edit the content with delvings through the research im more like a sheepdog rounding up the strays 
 always best to copy when in doubt i do the same myself if impossible to add map refs i suggest just to add that to the project todo list then anyone can have a go when they have time i think the mapping sofwtare went awry a couple of months ago glad you have joined in it was getting too much for me alone 
 solved it the trick is to copy the N and the nbsps as well 
 yes i thought that was the trick too but it just results in a postcode not found error message on multi maps page 
 you could ask 
 out of curiosity is it clear to you what makes rosetta not an emulator i will grant it seems to be a complex one but despite apples claim that rosetta is not an emulator i dont really see how it falls outside of the criteria for one it doesnt really seem that much different than the 
 i guess id like to know whats really going on there first hand and then put it in an article doesnt seem like thats going to happen anytime soon thanks for answering 
 its funny until receiving one i thought they were an unusual oddity yet i am moved by this old and ugly as i am thank you this has now prompted me to look out for worthwhile behaviour in others and to think about giving one or two 
 ditto myself they are on 
 i shall copy this to my user page 
 did you bother to read the reason why it was moved it was the same reason that 
 i will suggest moves for them as well 
 im troubled by the edit summary that accompanied were you asking a question or casting an aspersion with that edit summary in any regard my explanation can be found at 
 thank you for telling me about this error that i made i have written on the talk page sorry 
 accidents happen in the best regulated families 
 i was not casting aspersions at all edit summaries have a reasonably long but finite space to summarise what one has done i was stating that your second reversion was ill explained i stand by that phrase and made it unemotionally because i perceived that you had reverted in each case without regard to the content and had simply looked at process relying on vp as an infallible guide i will look at the other editors talk page but wanted to reply to you without being influenced by that first 
 now i have read your explanation i see it as both reasonable and uneasonable in equal measure the other editor made a misassumption that vp was a bot i think you may then have made a misassumption that s or he was acting in some way that was malicious or unwise or without regard to content and thus made your own reversion without regard to content vandals do make multiple edits but have seldom made sensible edits errors happen when one is working to protect wikipedia im sorry my edit summary troubled you 
 to take you through my thought process i saw the areverted bot edit summary for a reversion by 
 the difference in process when i revert what i believe may be vandalism i always look at the content i am reverting i make mistakes too i do not say that my way is better it simply give me more confidence we have all learnt something from this 
 the merge of vnc loop into optical feedback is unacceptable to me because it is not an optical pheneomenon at all it is a digital phenonomenon with no lenses involved please revert changes 
 i found the 
 ok sorry about that could you please explain or point me to the neologism and notability rules 
 thank you 
 i must point out that 
 you linked me to 
 thank you 
 i am discussing it on the N or N conspiracy theories page please join in it seems ridiculous to have multiple N or N ct templates on single pages do you not see that the old one should be deleted if we are now creating a new one 
 please do not use words such as do you not see that and also capital letters because they imply a patronising tone whether it seems ridiculous or not to you the two templates serve different functions and do not overlap 
 another sockpuppet account belonging to tommevlie called 
 yes its the same user but there is no reason to block him now he only uses N account and behaves well best wishes or 
 i am sorry that you took offence an edit summary doesnt give space for extensive disquisition on ones reasons for such edit however the see also reference that you inserted in the article has to do with a clean different subject 
 oh there are plenty of intext blue links to subjects as to which your matter is not irrelevant this article has to do with a minor surgical alternative to circumcision anyone who is interested in such matters is not going to be looking for them in this article indeed they are likely to have been led to this article from a more general article which will also lead them to your subject 
 well i just skimmed through the page you linked to and you are probably right according to rules as i added the link to my page myself it kinda troubles me that the current trend in wikipedia seems to be removing as much information as possible because it doesnt have encyclopedic value the high amount of information is what made it useful for me and probably lots of other people as well my gpld app dmgextractor would never have existed if it wasnt for the link i saw on the dmg page in wikipedia to the gpl program dmgN iso im trying not to whine here but i just think you are going in the wrong direction trying to tame wikipedia too much with extensive rules 
 it was some time since we communicated but i just wanted you to know that i have redone the page with dmgextractor thus eliminating the annoying ad that you complained about when you felt like testing my app im lazy so it took me some time to deal with the issue just in case you wanted to have a look at it 
 i think you are better off just ignoring him it doesnt look like he edits often enough to be of any real concern imho i do agree that the work you and thomas have done on that article have greatly improved iti dont know if it can become an fa but only time will tell the 
 i am inclined to agree however i also think it is time he put his money where his mouth is so to speak its an interesting username all sorts of connotations 
 there i dont know what erbdom is if that is some sort of address thanks 
 i dont know how to decipher this and i dont know if he has an email thanks 
 i finally figured it out i found the email link in the toolbox caz never set up his emaili think the problems is solved thanks 
 glad you solved it 
 my concern is to find such an editor who need not be an admin who has not edited articles on the N or N incidents and has no real interest in such articles nor in any disputes between official and unofficial versions of events and one who has the strength of character to close the discussion effectively and with rationale but which is the right place to request it the village pump is an obvious candidate but how does one ensure that ones volunteer has the attributes required 
 good thoughts probably with the heat in this discussion and the politicakl nature of the partoes involved we will need a pretty box around the outcome i am open to persuasion either way 
 yes thank you i have completely ignored that sectionuN its because im extremely fed up with the terminology we all use a bit upset to be honest surly didnuN t intend to patronize general grunting not pointed at anyone but at the system so to say it really helps when you suddenly feel the need to turn into vandal a scream of a sort i was thinking about taking a little break from all thisuN thanks again 
 yes the whole world is a conspiracy have fun with it 
 its called dialogue not snipinguN im really striving to ease this on everyone not sure why you need to take everything so personally for example take a look at my talk page one could argue it was sniped more than one time but i wont do that why would i we are having dispute i understand that i can react inappropriately and im shocked by some of my reactions but we are beating around the shrub here we are constantly wasting time once i have spend a whole month arguing about obvious things i had to walk five hundred miles to contribute to N article with very small yet factually accurate edit crystal clear issue its entropy for sure and if you play pingpong with all the same peopleuN well its boring if this would be with different editors it would be ok heck if different editors would work on N related articles i wouldnuN t even be there id rather be writing new ones if you consider my last remark to be inappropriate please accept my apology 
 whether dialogue or sniping i felt it was not appropriate and i accept your apology 
 i have noticed that you called for broader consensus which is good however please keep in mind that current subject of the template are also disputed and that protection doesnt endorse the current version if you would kindly note this in your prefaceuN thx 
 wholly unnecessary in my view please look at the head of the template itself where it states it with the normal clarity and the words that will please neither set of opinions it is always protected in the wrong version after allin the preamble we do not have to spoon feed everyone we need a far broader consensus than the very narrow group of people who have expressed strong opinions in one direction or another 
 there was a third option to this it was about control demolition hypothesis which is or was more than npov title after all arthur did point that cd template would be a worthy cause im not sure how to point this out at this particular stage and thats a bit of a shame well never mind as for that remark my mishap you did point it out and if you say that its clear i will take your word on it 
 if there is a third option and i do not believe that there is then i see no issue with your stating it clearly in the preamble and making an impartial post on talk pages of those who have stated their opinion notifying them that the option has been presented and inviting them to inspect and determine if their opinion remains valid it must be impartial or you will be accused of spamming 
 how are we to proceed 
 i have absolutely no idea what you are talking about please be more precise 
 im talking about our template you still have your little conspiracy up and running and i dont like it one bit therefore id like to hear whats our next stepuN guess its arbitration 
 remember that i have no fight with you or with anyone i am here simply because of the articles i choose to edit and to seek to edit those on the most responsible manner of which i am capable 
 lovely lecture to be honest im practicing remarkable resilience and politeness in last few months not to say that the whole community is all trigger happy itchy scratchy and all that decider divider polarization manipulationuN as you may have notice we are all of us a bit fed up with terminology terror terrorism fear fascismuN blah blah blahuN well there is always yet in this particular case we fail to recognize it we would rather impose an opinion than serve as knowledge database well i dont appreciate your tone either i will back out of this discussion have it your way you know N may appear but it is not a hegemony 
 arbitration sign me up too im sick of that locked template 
 i am not sure that the arbitration process is the correct place to go yet though have you looked at it and made sure that you have exhausted all the avenues you are asked to exhaust before seeking arbitration and what exactly is the matter you will put to arbitration i have no need of an answer but you need to be clear before starting the process 
 removing contradictions and making up excuses as to how they would fit counts as original research as it stands right now one event is made specific in one novel and its changed in the next thats all that needs to be said 
 original research is defined as unpublished facts arguments concepts statements or theories or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position there is nothing to indicate that hannibals dream when it occured was false unless harris himself stated that it was false in hannibal it should count as a contradiction what i wrote was the simple facts of what occured without any additional commentary which is how it should stay 
 this is what happened in hannibal hannibal recalls seeing his sisters teeth in a stool pit nothing indicates that this is false in rising hannibal notes this is to be false as this is different information than was previously established it is a contradiction in the current continuity harris retconned it to be a figment of hannibals dream i can agree with that but nothing indicates that this was the case in hannibal the same goes to hannibals animal abuse yes hannibal has been nice and cruel to humans but you cant use that to argue oh well that means he was mean to animals too nothing indicated that in rising he was ever abusive to animals at any point in his life neither before or after mischas death was hannibal shown to be cruel to animals and if he was harris would have mentioned 
 look im not doubting the whole idea of it being a dream thats beside the point what im trying to say is it wasnt false in hannibal it was treated as fact in that particular book by stating that its false harris is changing continuity 
 thank you i cling to the view that one mans troll is another mans staunch supporter in general the people with the most potential to upset us hold their views very close to their hearts and also to the surface they believe in their cause they simply fail to see that a cause has no place in articles im sure i also allow some personal views to creep in but i try very hard to maintain politeness and to see the good in everyone even if i disagree with them completely 
 the problem with that subsection is that it was already an orphan in the old section too i will integrate it back where its a bit more pertinent 
 good luck were you at wang too 
 do you even know the real definition of the word vandal vandal on a mission i have never heard such a ridiculous term if i were a vandal on a mission i would mess up random articles from different ip addresses do you listen i said before if i was a vandal i would have messed up articles as well there goes your overwhelming evidence and if i were a vandal i would not waste my time arguing with you ok ok i get it you can stop giving me links to the article on what wikipedia is not if i disagree i should have an administrator review it what if the press found out about it and it in the headline wikipedia the free porn site where only some may edit im not threatening but what if somebody else does that 
 from my perspective this subject is now closed you may post a reply if you wish but i have no interest in replying to you further

 hi sorry for removing those image links i read it wrong and didnt see that youd only just added them and were probably still working on them 
 its really okay i usually add them so i can remember them later 
 thanks i will be sure to follow your edits this week as well 
 sigh kinclaith was given to the bishop who became the owner of the land you ought to read more carefully before making silly sarcastic comments anyways barrow knows more about high medieval glasgow than anyone else and failure by your sources to mention this reveals only flaws in them the source im using is as impeccable as it gets so you will do well to get round it regards 
 simply repeating your false belief hardly makes it true maybe you should take a breather give it more thought and tell me exactly what im missing 
 would have to look 
 thanks for your words of encouragement i may well return but it is individuals criticsing my ideas i am happy to learn and to be corrected and even to be constructively criticised but not to be harmfully critisised at every step thanks again 
 as a side issue i have just found out that i used to sail with the maley of maley and taunton ltd the midlands tramways contractors and general engineers this was a pure coincidence that i found when researching a book im writing odd how things come together 
 never be pushed simply come to a firm conclusion after a time of reflection and then make a decision with a good heart while making your decision simply recognise that many perhaps all of the best editors have have had early suboptimal experiences a large number of these go on to help the newer editors understand their way around the many minefields here 
 yes thats one thing ive said im going to try to do welcome new editors and members to tram and train related articles and by pushed i think i meant pursuaded by the kind words and good reasons thanks 
 develop a skin like rhino hide and a manner that is at least outwardly easy going and relaxed it really does help and if the going gets tough as a friendly admin for advice by using on your talk page and describing the issue unemotionally it really does work 
 why did you change the or in to a and ltbr and gt in this doesnt group the pieces of software into any groups if you did it for looks i want you to note that people use their browser with different widths and in most cases this just makes it worse try stretching your browser window back and forth this being the case i hope you will revert your edit 
 i reverted your edit for now feel free to speak out if there was another reason for having the break in the article 
 it does not look better it may look better on your computer you have to realize that web browsing environments are very different some people use a cellular phone and some other use a plasma television you can not decide a break point that would make sense for anyone else but you please dont edit wikipedia to make it look better on your computer please revert the edit 
 the average reader is browsing at either N xN or N xN that is what we aim for and we make choices all the time that style our content for those resolutions oh and neither of the computers i use to edit wikipedia run at those resolutions 
 the matter still disturbs me where is this policy stated are all wikipedia articles modified every time the average display size changes how does wikipedia even know what the average display size is 
 inexplicable and severe and we have changed nothing there we have been working on solving it for a few days 
 i like to avoid a redirect as much as the next guy but please remember that 
 it seems that you are in the habit of editing ve reports on itunes and may well even be an apple employee 
 hope that helps explain in case you are wondering im not seeking a pardon or absolution for my part in this i have done nothing wrong here in my view + 
 the article is a dreadful mess im seriously tempted to afd nominate it but i have chosen not to in order to give others who care about it the change to get it into order im not going to edit it myself but i am going to watch it and consider whether it is improving i hope it does i fear it will not 
 would you mind commenting here please cholga 
 i would mind i have nothing useful to add here 
 hi yopie i generally support your position on the merits but i question your use of the word vandalism in the edit you reverted was clearly not vandalism but someone pursuing a content dispute namecalling undermines the possibility of eventually reaching consensus which should be our goal however outofreach it may appear 
 please read official manual of british government a manorial title is not a title of nobility and may be bought and sold by the owner of the property to which the title refers about your question deletion of sourced reliable informations are considered as vandalism btw there are many fraudsters with titles so we need this article referenced 
 yesi think that that might do but again i would be unsure how to implement it could you help by perhaps just putting in the first task or something cheers 
 i was sure now i am not i am asking for serious help to undo the thing and make it work it was so simple last time i did this 
 ok thanks a lot anyway what might have confused you a bit is to save time i created one page the page you edited on and then used to put it on the portal and the project page maybe i should have made that clearer anyway a bit of expertise is what we need ey they might bring even more to the project 
 i am grateful i was so far out of my depth that as 
 i left in the comment i dont think theres a pressing need to remove it it was only made N minutes after the tfd closed 
 as to the second removal of your edit while you are sure the person is irrelevant another editor considers them to be relevant this is where consensus building comes in argue your case on the template talk page and accept winning it or losing it also do as a matter of importance read 
 could you please spend a moment to add your N cents to 
 i have a simple opinion regarding trivia there are places where it is valid and places where it is invalid i believe that each occurrence should be treated on its merits so i will look and consider contribution 
 please do not remove cited information from their page i understand removing some of the trivia however there is further uncited information on their page and instead of deleting it all add the citation needed tag or just leave them there as the page already has a notice saying it doesnt cite its sources thanks 
 thats alright just one part that was removed was cited i guess you just missed that bit i understand what you mean people do somewhat abuse wikipedias free editing policy 
 i have not read it however i have contacted the 
 hi tim could you include your actual username in your sig i got might confused when i clicked on that link just a friendly request 
 i fear this is a wikimedia thing it confused me too the first time 
 just noticed this actually its because you modified your signature in 
 i risk being blocked because i followed an established process pretty much as soon as i joined well that would be amusing i suppose what help do you believe i need on this i have a user name and i have a nickname like many other wikipedians how is this in any way misleading i am sorely confused i know of no rules that say that the username and the nickname must be identical so yes inform me please 
 having looked closely at 
 why are you claiming that im spamming wikipedia every external link i have places is highly relevant if im doing something wrong i would be interested in knowing what it isplease advise 
 i am not fixyas ceo but i am related to the company let me understand if i get you correctly the proper way to add fixya related information would be to write a request in the talk page of each topic if this is the case i have no objection but i would like to know if this is the process that each edit goes through and if not why should fixya be an exception let me remind you again that every page i have edited was relevant and would benefit wikis users also please note that other than very limited amount of advertisement fixya is a free source of information thanks 
 or text 
 you too joN n hope to see you around 
 im afraid there is no way to embed an image like that the only way to include it is as you say download the image and then upload it to wikipedia however you shouldnt do that just yet as that image has no information about the source of the image or the copyright status on the english wikipedia we need to know where the image came from and what license it is under before it can be uploaded here 
 somehow that is what i feared that same image has proliferated into other language versions of this article when it is properly licensed would commons be the right place for it i have zero experience with commons 
 ah the next question is how to make commons available to non wp wikis 
 thanks tim and others for your efforts in this matter that has answered a lot for me while the answer isnt the one id hoped for i nonetheless understand why it is that way 
 it is not necessary to host an irc server at the datacenter just an irc client it is actually not even necessary to do that the irc client could be located elsewhere accepting udp packets from the wiki 
 my challenge is that all the data centers our operation can use have contracts that expressly prohibit any and all irc activity i will get my technical genius to look at it some more because i may be misassuming 
 aswick N N april N 
 please provide your areference that vista N bit is not a supported opearting system what is indicated on a downlowd page is not a sufficient reason and the reference in the text that was fixed is a support article from apple for visat an official press from apple that vista is not officially supported will suffice so please provide this if you can otherwise the correction should stand this is another issue i will pursue 
 the download page obviously matters because that is where people go to get itunes the download page clearly states windows N or xp and windows N service pack N or later or windows xp as soon as that changes the itunes article on wikipedia will be updated 
 sorry recommended operating system versions for download doesnt constitute officially supported i think it would be resonable to ask for the offical press release from apple to maintain this sort of statement and of expression in an eminent encyclopedia like wikipedia 
 please provide it if you can otherwise should revert this sentence 
 i dont want to waste time on this so get over it so we can both move on with our lives or we can escallate it make your choice this is one minor but very well defined point now that i will win as i am positive that there is no official press release only the official statement in the link that N bit is not supported whilst the character and flavour clearly suggests otherwise for vista N bit so unless you can find something from apple say that they officially do not support vists then you are out of luck as they say my friend 
 so allow me to revert and get on with your life unless you are the young juvenille geek that i hope you are not and so can follow a rational and precise argument impartially regards 
 thank you for supporting my rfa which unfortunately didnt succeed the majority of the opposes stated that i needed more experience in the main namespace and wikipedia namespace so that is what i will do i will go for another rfa in two months time and i hope you will be able to support me then as well if you have any other comments for me or wish to be notified when i go for another rfa please leave them on my talk page if you wish to nominate me for my next rfa please wait until it has been two months thanks again for participating in my rfa 
 was a total pleasure you ought to have succeeded but i think people take wp sometimes rather too seriously while creating a good encyclopaedia is a serious business nothing should prevent people from enjoying it 
 you warned that if they vandalized any more articles they would be blocked the have made several since then 
 then report them yourself please at 
 i did too taught kids to sail in them as well ours were triple thickness laminate and wer amazingly heavy 
 a 
 thank you i have removed the prod and given a substantial rationale on the articles talk page i can see why you considered it for deletion and hope my rationale convinces you otherwise 
 im not sure what you mean by pointing out that votes were placed before the version you created could you elaborate 
 i see how the vanity is taken care of but i still think this should have gone to drv the gN criterion applies to reposts in which any revisions made clearly do not address the reasons for which the page was deleted i can see how your version might address the notability concerns but it does not seem clear cut enough to me i also think that the fact that someone still voted to delete after you made revisions suggests that they still didnt think the person was notable that the original vfd was a year and a half ago and the article you reposted is still a stub is also not a good sign 
 that didnt occur to me but that would have been fine also i would suggest though that the afd and drv process are pretty similar so perhaps nothing has been lost if youd still prefer afd for whatever reason id be perfectly willing to restore the article provided the afd is started pretty soon after restoration 
 thanks well i feared as much but it was worth asking for an expert opinion the oddity was repeatable but ctrl or refresh appears to have stopped it so i suspect a gremlin 
 i have a tech problem which i have been trying to solve i found this link for haslam http or or wwwtempleofsaintnickcom or articles or eveningstandard_N htm it has relevant quotes from him about his life during his warhol days before ritz and also references to his party giving snag is i dont know how to do the coding for newspaper articles which have been published on another site as in this instance also i am unsure what is the title for this site and on this site the evening standard doesnt have an author i did ask my adopter for advice but i forgot to ask him how to do the coding for the quote he was helpful and showed me how to ref the actual link after i then asked him for more details on how how to code the ref i sent him another message informing him i was working it out but i cant i appreciate you are busy and apologise for querying you about this but any tips on how to do the ref coding for a quote from this newspaper article which has been published on another site would be invaluable 
 i see my adopter is depressed at the moment as soon as he is happy again i shall ask him to help solve my coding query 
 noone will object of you ask for another adopter 
 i have just expanded the haslam page i did the coding without help but on the refs websites url which i used the article didnt have a byline i found the articles uthor on another so would this be wikipedia legal my adopter is still depressed but shall ask him this as well 
 no idea bt i think it ought to be borderline ok 
 i see there is some coding showing in the warhol ref ie i cant see how to rectify this my adopter is still depressed when you have time could you please look at my coding on the haslam page apologies for this want to get it right 
 sorted it 
 cheers 
 thanks for finding the more valid citation i dont see that kind of persistence often in ensuring that the information is backed up i was wondering though where did the cast of N information come from its not in the article are there any other articles available sometimes articles reporting on the same subject will tend to have special information compared to the rest uN 
 i have 
 thanks you for the citation for the above article however the N edition of forsters life of dickens pg N clearly says and on his own birthday in the following february he had tidings of the death of his second son walter 
 i checked the earlier edition and not seeing it there was concerned kaplan is a much more reliable biography anyway it is more scholarly than a biography written by a friend 
 absolutely i just wanted to set the record straight in case you thought i was making the reference up i dont have kaplan recently waded my way through ackroyd though best wishes 
 i have all three if you guys need a third party on any of the matters 
 the passage can be found by the way 
 also there are over ten entries in ackroyd i can info from them if awadewit doesnt want to or doesnt have the time 
 it looks good i also think the level of detail is about right but its likely that the N th and N st century items will take up less space whenever an existing article covers the subject let that article carry as much of the detail as possible we ought to tackle 
 you seem to be removing a fair bit of content from gaa articles but you didnt use an edit summary are the players not playing for the teams any more the large removals have me a little puzzled 
 ok would you mind using an edit summary you are confusing more than a few rc patrollers 
 hi gnevin im not too sure about infobox naming so i recommend you ask at the 
 fine if you wish to add this person show who he or she is then please and establish the notability required nothing on google to support your entry http or or wwwgoogleie or searchhlen and qleonard+ per centN hairdresser per centN per centN c+london+high+society+N s+hairdresser+ and btngsearch and meta i am removing it please dont reply thanks 
 i keep replying in this users talk page but the user keeps blanking the replies they are of course in the edit history 
 please stop thank you 
 i have no interest now in attempting any communication with you of any description the banner on your talk page was extremely discourteous i attempted to enter into sensible dialogue with you and my opinion of your behaviour is that it became 
 no offence was intended i dragged up an old banner and i apologise if the implication was perceived as having been directed at you personally it was not although i accept your point thank you for stopping posting me messages i am off to bed good night 
 i am happy to accept your comment about the banner and your apology i do not even so have an interest in trying to reopen a dialogue with you on the matter of leonard the hairdresser nor about the value of redlinks which i perceive as a positive asset to wp unless you indicate that you are happy to have that dialogue in a spirit of open mindedness i am always open to persuasion though this will be a difficult point to persuade me on 
 i tried nominating 
 well i think that i fixed things if you could doublecheck on that though then id appreciate it thanks uN 
 advice please i am tempted to put in the rn article that lynn once appeared in a leonard ad with the caption who else would listen to me bitch but although relevant to the article i suspect this could be seen as puffery considering i started the article 
 you find it and a reference and i will add it 
 okay i will try and find it 
 can you please advise me on this i have just added an external link for schumi to the rn article its his website displaying his paintings is this considered advertising if so i will delete it 
 i have removed the schumi external link from the rn article 
 in an article about him i see it as fine as a citation about him since it is self published it would not be as a citation for someone or something else it is fine break the problem into compartments and generally the right answer arrives by magic 
 a logical answer i shall leave it off because i dont think the link is strictly appropriate for this article 
 i have a problem i have been left a warning notice on the rn article saying the celebrities need citation i have done one for paul mccartney im now trying to code a citation for sammy davis jnr and robert mitchum but might have to leave it until the morning could you please tell me will that be too late 
 do not let it pressure you the article a good article would not exist at all if you had not created it the citation required tags are not just for you but for any interested editor they place the article in a category that effectovey asks for help 
 thanks for this im so tired that although i have tried to supply the coded citation for sammy davis jnr i have made mistakes so shall try and cite the others tomorrow and when i do cite everything should i then remove the warning messages 
 yes you trade a citation for the individual warning messages 
 as i have managed to do one citation in the celebrity section does this mean i can remove the warning messsage in that section or shall i wait until i do more 
 be a politician satisfy the tag as fully as you can before removing it people appreciate that 
 good advice i do see that my citation which i supplied for leonard earlier today is no longer there but shall work on it tomorrow 
 i think the edit history says it identifies who leonard is but not that he advertised it is easy to cite the wrong thing by accident festina lente 
 for the rn article does leonard need to be linked to ritz in a url for a citation 
 i get it i shall have to now edit the article carefully tomorrow and of course provide the citations 
 and thanks for the cat villiers citation i will just have to delete stuff that i cant find citations for 
 there are many articles without an infobox image because nobody has found a free alternative wasnt there one of singer at comiccon ages ago 
 fact is we can have the picture but not in the infobox if you just want to show his appearance fair use needs to illustrate something specific like his trek fandom but there is a freealternative for his appearance 
 this is how i have had it explained dont have an infobox image then if you havent got a free alternative and wait for an opportune moment like a kind editor or the us governments public domain works im sorry if you dont understand but remember fair use policy on wikipedia doesnt extend to simply showing appearances 
 here are three perfectly clear free use images maybe you could use one of these 
 welcome back 
 thanks for the welcome as you can see above not much has changed so i believe that i will be taking another long hiatus who let the above said religious zealot into the ranks while i am on my rant incidentally koko or kyack or what ever your name is if the code is available for me to read it is available for me to use thanks for the link to the hexa color code chart i just so happen have a copy that came with my copy of macromedia dream weaver when i was in school learning to write html so how have things been noseptember xerocs N N november N 
 well heres some more free advice one guys rfa failed the other day partly because of his use of the word fucking as the word douche above is in a similar category you might want to rethink that strategy feel free to run again for rfa by all means but id strongly heed kyokos advice above furthermore personal attacks of the sort you just made are offensive and not conducive to building an encyclopedia please dont do it again 
 hello xerocs if you would prefer seek rfa guidance from someone else you are free to do so but i suspect that most anyone you ask will give you the same feedback that i did im no longer inclined to continue guiding you after your last message i will give you some parting advice please read wikipedias policies on 
 read that article in the link the third paragraph under the picture making a new xna game its says for this tutorial start with the windows game project once you have selected it you can immediately run the project and see a wonderful cornflower blue blank screen also codngN fun is runed by microsoft so it realible source 
 also how is my edit for latin vandalism 
 others may cite elements or may remove them or may add real rubbish you may choose to police this article to keep it as clean as possible or may move on to another both approaches are valid i stay with articles myself while i am adding value and then i move on i pop back if they still interest me 
 that is interesting especially as two people who were involved with ritz say they intend to edit the article further 
 excellent news they too will probably need help to understand the diff between this place and journalism 
 yes im sure they will and thanks for adding citations for young and bailey 
 there ought to be a party after this article is seriously cited the question is which gossip columns will it appear in ~giggles~ 
 funny but i have now cited 
 please ignore my last message i have solved my coding problem 
 i have done all the citations on the rn article i did a citation for lear and lavers i couldnt source a couple of things so edited them out creating this article was certainly a learning curve 
 also i have this link which confirms that stephen laveres worked for a and m http or or wwwonamrecordscom or britain_am_staffhtml but it doesnt relate to ritz i dont think i could use it as an external link 
 correct 
 i intend to now move on to create my next article but shall keep an eye on the rn one and again many thanks 
 its quite an experience isnt it you will soon be helping other new editors 
 if you had said this to me a few weeks ago i wouldnt have believed it 
 and good luck with all your articles 
 im sure we will meet again if you need any help do ask if i can i will heck i feel i know you 
 im sure i shall need your help in the future you have been a brilliant tutor a crash course and ditto to you 
 actually there is one thing i want to clarify access date means the retrieve date i see that the access date on the marie helvin autobiography ref on the rn article is the same date as the article was written is this a mishtake 
 accessdate is the date the data was viewed by the person doing the citing it is not an error if the article was genuinely written that day 
 just to make sure i havent made mistake in all my refs i said the access date was todays date i think im correct 
 N per cent 
 kev the graphs dont render very well could you please either upload them as png or convert to svg id be happy to do either for you if you like 
 kevin you might find that most active is a less controversial description than top also i was going to put some stuff in about the decreasing share of edits from the N if you look at 
 ps i have had a query at 
 the problem with most active is it might give the impression we are talking about wikipedians with the most edits within the last N days thats my opinion though but i do think it could use a better title whatever people think that might be 
 regarding the summary of another that does not have its own article ie is not notable notability is unrelated to having or not having a wp article i assume you just misspoke because the rationale as its stated is invalid 
 ah read some comments on this page other editors appear to have raised similar concerns with your edits to dns software comparison article you did in fact remove few notable entries from the remote desktop software article all in all lists and comparison tables fall into a gray area of wp policies what you consider a valid removal reason may not be how other editors interpret the same policy therefore as a courtesy to other editors please consider first discussing your tentative changes on talk pages especially when it involves a removal of the content which is considered by many an action of an absolutely last resort thanks for reading this 
 the way you had phrased it implied that the lack of notability followed from the lack of article moreover the reverse is often also not a case here see for yourself vs the same goes for which scores N times more hits than my point is that a cleanup based on a formal criteria without considering a context or a background is quite often overly destructive as it trims useful content therefore it does not hurt to talk about it first removing the content is easy restoring it is not 
 thanks for the response submitted for your consideration we will not like the outcome of baiting people into writing articles about these products many of them are marginally notable at best but shipped by companies with N trade press stories my experience with the afd log tells me theyd survive afd how do afd voters judge a real story from one planted by pr so now we have N new wp articles all hard to delete all magnets for coi edits and pov disputes (we already had a nasty one between 
 ok thanks following your lead also didnt mean to convey that sam was causing problems i think that situation has resolved itself 
 well to be fair it wasnt a forum post i have seen people use macrumourscom articles before as sources at wikipedia furthermore the wikipedia reference i used has more than N references and to include them all would be overwhelming i didnt realize we couldnt use wikipedia articles for reference so i added some direct links to itunes and apple tv version history from their website 
 well if i can get blocked for the three revert rule so can you 
 thanks for keeping it and redirecting to the yahoo article sorry for misunderstanding buddy oh and the above comment was mine 
 im workinginprogress on my ritz newspaper article now but see my adopter has wikibonked have asked him a tech question but i can wait for him to respond until i finish the actual writing of the article 
 i confess i am finding this very difficult to do but no doubt i shall eventually get the hang of it if nicky i wanted to get my article up tonight but its not nearly finished 
 thanks a lot for this help i shall study it and apply it 
 pps wikibonked as in is not around they probably have a real life too 
 well not all of the artists are the same but even when they are the same it shows up as different albums i didnt have this problem after N 
 do you want a screenshot 
 did you get it yet see it genuinely doesnt work even when the album artist is null the artists are different compilation is checked and album art is all the same 
 thank you for your contributions to this article i am an admiring fan of your work on naval articles i notice you recently deleted the rn aircraft ferries from the listing i had prepared of various ship types performing similar missions i had originally included them in a relatively comprehensive comparison because of the importance of aircraft carriers in transporting combat aircraft to forward bases but i acknowledge the significant difference about launch capability i confess my references did not contain detailed information about the loading and offloading capabilities of the rn aircraft ferries have you evaluated the 
 the ferries are one element wether the small ones that ferried aircraft from port to cams and macs or the larger ones and at times carriers were used as ferries but on the whole they need treatment separately to the escort carriers might i suggest a 
 i really think they need to be near the bottom next to the filmographies as there is much more room usually and it looks better style wise and fits in place 
 i put them on the top in the same spirit as the olympic medalists have the medals at the beginning but i am opened for a discussion where shall we put it regards 
 well i guess the ones that are very slim could go near the top but the long ones dont look well with the articles text and in some cases block out text it would be best to keep those types right next to the filmographies 
 i agree that it is sometimes unconvenient maybe we should just modify the template in either case we should stick to the same pattern in every case i opened a discussion at 
 i have just looked at my saved page crushed is distributed by exposure and is published by eiworth publishing can i alter that or do i have to get another editor to change this 
 forgot to indent my last message 
 would it be considered puffery if i used a quote by amanda lear from a published ezine article i wrote about the seventies i havent yet found any other references for lear referring to ritz also i hope this isnt puffery i used the barry fantoni article ref from my page 
 if it is relevant then it os not puffery a tightrope to walk though 
 if i dont find any ritz references for lear i shall resort to using it 
 i saw you reverted my edit to the hfs plus article where i added that it was proprietary how come you reverted the edit was i wrong isnt the system a proprietary closed file system 
 removing the word proprietary from other articles isnt appropriate though while it may not be the perfect term to describe nonopensource software its currently the best we have got if you can suggest a more neutral alternative shoot but simply removing it wherever it appears is losing information 
 incorrect information and biased information sure but simply removing information which happens to use a biased term is destructive with all the effort you are going to in order to get rid of it surely you can spend a little bit of extra effort and come up with a better alternative 
 one thing id add to this thread i think its fair to point out that opinion is divided on reference formats many editors view the full citation formats such as as cumbersome and the sliding reference section with verbose quotes as in 
 im happy to work with you to formulate such a proposal one that will meet your reasonable objection to their cumbersome nature and meet my desire to deploy them more fully and well in thsi way we can do what we should always be doing learning from the past and present and enhancing the future what say you 
 by unencyclopedic emphatically no insult was meant i used it in the sense of not in the style youd expect in this encyclopedia i have no idea if theres some specific rule somewhere about the use of extensive quotation in references but purely on the evidence of general nonuse these verbose references even though informative just arent the current wikipedia style for referencing 
 i share any rational persons hatred of the full citation templates i persevere rather than enjoy using them because they add so much to the article 
 one of the things mentioned on the wikipedia page blocking editing from N was the possibility of a year long block on anonymous editing from this ip who would i contact to have this put in place i teach at 
 i dont think that this is standard procedure and per 
 i understand but can only say the sooner the better the temporary blocks on editing brought about by our 
 the oneyear block would prevent registration anyway so even if i were to block it for one year the students with good intentions would need to use unblockenl or some other means to create an account 
 hello again i wasnt sure which talk page i should put this query i thought it might be a good idea to have another heading on the rn article titled issue content then start off listing all the interviews with credits including the photographer credit how does wikipedia work in this instance does an editor just go ahead and edit first before seeking advice 
 ps my adopter is wikibonked again 
 i think be bold and do it id love to have an issue list too with details of cover picture where the picture is somehow significant if the pic is mundane ignore it 
 would you mind looking at the rn article the image and the logo has been u or loaded i hope this has been done correctly 
 i didnt upload the cover and the logo so i am not sure if the person who did it left a sig 
 my adopter answered my query saying if the person who uploaded the picture follows the 
 this is now going to be fun as i see other editors have now started to edit the rn article so i shall keep an eye on this 
 this is the hard part letting go is now important correct factual inaccuracies by all means but avoid stylistic differences generally but not always articles are improved by letting go 
 yep note the 
 i am going to let go of the rn article now unless i spot factual inaccuracies 
 its really hard to do that i suggest you avoid going back to it for a month or so and simply move on with the next edits to other articles or creation of other articles remember alwasy that people will edit what we write just because they think they can write it better and who are we to judge that they will change things because they can or because it is a genuine improvement the thing is none of that actually matters and the reason is it is not a job we dont get hired or fired because of what we do here we just choose to do it 
 lol some people just like to make trouble for themseleves dont they 
 alistair i opened an ssp report on this case 
 i have absolutely no idea what this is about who this user is or anything else about it i did make some technical edits some time ago to this template but that cant be it surely so anyone who can shed any light on this please do so 
 unfourtunately i know exactly what that is about thanks for the notice on my talk page these are the actions of a wikistalker that has been harrassing me and others who associate with me in any way since july N under wikipedia rules while these actions are not officially allowed jimbo wales will do nothing to change wikipeida if it interferes with his stated religion belief of open editing at all costs also unforutunately you are part of the cost im sorry you were involved in this way but there is absolutely nothing that can be done to stop people like this and the stalkers know it i will do what i can to get an admin to clean up the mess thanks for the alert 
 as they say bill shit happens the best thing one can do with a mess like this is to document it and leave it well documented in plain sight 
 i need to contact you privately can we work out a way thanks 
 i thought email this user was enabled it is now that should work 
 thanks for sorting out the formatting of the references yes i like the way wikipedia entries can constantly improve id mentioned southampton to explain why i was referring to a book with southampton in its title but i certainly dont have strong views about including it 
 i think you need to place on your talk page and ask a passing friendly giant to help i have done my best and also failed N N april N 
 other articles (eg 
 the configiration is that it has a pair of waterwheels each of those wheels drives a single pair of stones it may be beneficial if you are correct about it being the sole remaining tide mill to make it even clearer go for it 
 i dont understand why you are still confused the article as indicated by the title is divided into three parts the bad part is overwhelmingly the largest part of the article it doesnt matter if his conclusion is that mac os x is better than anything else out there the article still largely contains a list of things that tog thinks should be fixed in panther things that he thinks were better in mac os 
 i really cant make this any clearer before answering please take a bit of time out to read your earlier comments and edit summaries 
 hi i am attempting to sort out the 
 i have listed two images you uploaded at 
 the uk houses of parliament were designed by an architect does that mean i violate his copyright if i upload a photograph of them this is barking mad 
 the thing is deleting articles about non notable items is wholly valid it is up to the people who work within the article to assert the notability of the thing about which the article is written no amount of rhetoric will save an article instead the article must be rescued 
 the simplest way is to be bold merge it yourself and then set allied pickfords australia as a redirect to 
 a little hint while editing refs in a section just pop in a temporary at the end and you can preview them locallybut dont forget to remove it again or you will give away your secret 
 of course tks 
 and also experienced users who dont want to become admins preferring to remain as content editors but as a matter of course revert vandalism 
 agreed 
 and mdash 
 i have no interest in this discussion the user seems to be disruptive and does not seem to be learning anything from other peoples reaction 
 possibly because of a miscommunication between those involved a more personal explanation of wikipedias policies might generate a more positive response and mdash 
 then since you appear to have infinite patience please explain it to the user how hard can it possibly be to understand the talk page of the disputed article a user who gets retaliatory in a huge flurry tends to need more than gentle explanations i will not be taking this user under my wing others yes this one no 
 sorry but you need to reread our policies particularly 
 again please go back and undo your damage so we can resume using the list as an index of articles in the subject area making sure that each list entry reflects a claim from its host article 
 again im sorry but our policies are clear articles have to contain reliable sources for everything you cant just say the reliable sources are on some other wikipedia article go find them if you are aware of a policy that states otherwise please let me know 
 my point is that if you delete the list entry you are responsible for deleting the corresponding claim in the source article 
 i added some references to 
 it may be notable and you have added good references but it does not in my view deserve a separate article that is why i have taken it to afd 
 if you feel that the list itself needs citations why delete it when you can simply copy sources from the original article however on the deletionist side of things computergeezer is correct if you believe the list is in error you should also be removing the claim from the parent article and removing it from the accompanying category you are only doing one third of your task here 
 and of course this got dragged over to 
 im neither one way nor the other actually it just seems a bit odd to prod one for speedying and not the rest id look into it more but im lazy 
 well i was considering the other N it just seemed like a lot of work if th eone i nominated stayed 
 point taken just letting you know i have no particular deeplyheld feelings on the subject 
 well whilst article doesnt use the term trademark it actually does use the term airfix generically so i personally think you are wrong on that one but the cat may be deleted anyhow 
 i believe only airfix can create an airfix kit if someone creates it then it is in essence generic no matter what logos they put on it 
 i disagree a genericised trademark is one which has entered the 
 excuse me why did you remove the legacy section what was wrong with the content 
 apology accepted but you know that i dont have to provide a reference that states that airfix is a genericised trademark all i need to do is to produce a series of references that show that airfix is a genericised trademark which i have started to do and actually im not fussed about what categories are on it what is important is what the article informs the reader of 
 will get overwritten by the bot every week probably makes sense to switch to a header template or something wherever that list is being copied to or transcluded 
 ah that makes sense by the way is there any way that we can get the bot to update the master list every week so we dont have discrepancies in data thanks 
 that poses political problems im not sure what the current situation is i just know that there was a specific reason that a user sandbox was used instead of a projectspace page 
 if you are talking about having a project page with a master list we have one and people are updating it with your bots data every so often 
 that article might end up at transgendered people who were murdered on wheels 
 love it 
 how nice 
 hi greetings form surrey i think i did what you asked on my update to the page let me know if its good as you can probably tell i am new to all of this its a work in progress which will take a while editing the page as well as linking and expanding thanks 
 its a good start i will add something to your talk page that may be of use 
 hello i was wondering what made you think that 
 i have actually read that page as i said the chrome is part of safari however the internal stuff is part of webkit i mean if you are really that worried about the chrome i could crop it out as proved byt the webkit page you gave me the screenshot is of both safari and webkit 
 ok if you really dont think there should be a screenshot of the layout engine displaying the webpage then i wont argue with you although as to your time comment whether the image should be put in or not is not dependent on how much time you have 
 please help i am finding this system a bit confusing 
 it doesnt matter that the band has or has not approved it im afraid what matters is whether they are suitable for inclusion in an encyclopaedia i happen to think they are others disagree 
 i know i have made you more unhappy rather than reassured you this is how the place works it does not create notability it records it to make the cut the band has to be notable already my view is borderline others have a different view your job is to assert that notability 
 no need to say sorry i understand what you said in afd discussion but now i wonder why pages like 
 i see a case in point for an article on the biography of this army major on account of the interest in this persons life that is already showing up in blogging circuits and media the article as it stands may not sufficient effort and research is needed to establish all facts about his contribution in the current event and in events before articles should not be made afd so soon after their creation others havent even got a chance to review it yet 
 articles may be nominated for deletion at any time blogs are not 
 it would help if i had any idea what you were confused about you might like to look at 
 i noticed that you from the system N page although i generally agree with not using posts as references this link was not a reference but a link to the closest thing available to a system N page on apples website if you did this intentionally thats fine i just wanted to check that you thought about it first 
 this is a tricky one but i think sdfisher may be right here if the most official thing that apple provides for system N is a support forum then we probably should link to it 
 actually im thinking now that alistair did the right thing deciding factor web page is system N x and older system software not system N specifically could probably put it in an external link though 
 back in N you made in which you opted for 
 its fine to link either the occurance of eagle or almirante cochrane in the text so its more a stylistic thing than set in stone i have rewritten the section now i have looked it over again 
 if it is determined that the image does not qualify under the nonfree content policy it might be deleted by an administrator within a few days in accordance with our 
 i am placing this note on the image talk page 
 looks better thanks 
 could you perhaps lay off the word vandalism theres no reason to assume that this was indeed vandalism that was the ips one and only edit so chances are they were just experimenting take a look at 
 ok this took me a while to understand firstly you didnt revert the vandalism the ip before you did but only partially you finished the job but as such there was no need to label it as reverting vandalism as to me that suggests that you are labelling the second ip as a vandal get it no me neither sorry it was a bit of a mess and your edit summary wasnt great but i came down on you a tad too hard appologies 
 i think most people would also like to see the full name of the mou in bold in the intro this is wp style but not mandatory 
 moving an article there is or ought to be a tab named move which will work very well an alternative is to place on your talk page and ask the question you would like help with kind folks drop by and take you by thye hand and lead you towards enlightenment 
 please look at which i created earlier i cannot make the hard line breaks in list N go away i have no idea why they are there and no desire for them id love it if they could be made to vanish by magic mediawiki line breaks are a mystery 
 you had hard breaks between each of the years to remove them i just backspaced until each entry was touching the prior and spaced forward one is the template displaying as you wanted it to now 
 and i thought id tried that very many thanks it is as i hoped it would be when i stafrted 
 hi any chance you could make a detailed tributary map of the loire basin currently writing it at 
 sure i dont know when i will get to it but will add it to the list 
 i think the source you are pointing to says that you need the license for the nonkernel parts of the system not the kernel source itself 
 feel free to change it as you see fit i just happened to be passing through 
 btw the expand template is supposed to be used on articles not talk pages 
 thats not what 
 its not that big of a deal since the template is currently only used in one article and i dont mean to denigrate the overall quality of your contributions both as an administrator and an editor but i would appreciate it if you would take a little more time to read deletion discussions in the future before closing them cheers 
 thanks for being so forthcoming i had no idea the backlog was that bad i certainly appreciate you stepping up to the plate with tfd noms 
 im surprised it took him this long to create one about me thanks for letting me know 
 you have email 
 please do not delete entries from this list without a good reason the fact that they do not have an article on wikipedia doesnt mean they shouldnt appear in the list also the criteria for a list and for an article are not the same (see 
 so you are deleting my changes based on a coi criteria only did you check at all if the apps you have deleted are notable as far as i know it is not recommended to create articles with which you have a conflict of interest however its not forbidden additionnally one of the reaons i write about dock application is because i have created one researched the topic discussed it with users and got their feedback and therefore know more about the subject than most people additionnally right now without looking much i can find a dozen of articles who are known to have coi issues and yet remain on wikipedia are you going to delete them all and block their authors thanks 
 please could a very nice person look at 
 doesnt look obtrusive to me how do you mean 
 well i feel it dominates the table rather but im happy to take your opinion 
 doesnt look too bad its about as narrow as it can get 
 i was wondering about a simple method of smallening the text for the entire column that might move it from not to bad to pleasant 
 put at the beginning and at the end 
 thanks for removing that it was added by a real jerk whos currently got about N firefighters trying to get him to stop flaming on the talk page i was doubtful of it but left it in the humor him so if you want to get involved on 
 thats fine i understand 
 can you help me out by explaining why you are commenting on this page i really am curious 
 i am commenting because i have the right to comment there is absolutely no reason for me to justify this to you 
 posted reply at 
 happy new year i havent been active on wikipedia but i do intend to create an article on austin de lone the musician when i eventually do i shall be in touch i do hope all is well and you are creating lots of interesting entries cheers 
 hi frances just having fun sometimes here and sometimes not glad you are coming back to create more articles 
 hi fiddle faddle i have been absent from wikipedia for so long i cant even remember who is my wikipedia guide cant locate hs name on my history page i would like to start creating a page on austin de lonei think he would be a good subject to do his base is in mill valley california he is a very prolific musician he was the director of a festival called the bammies he got honoured by the mill valley authorities last year he reworks band for a living he is also a prolific songwriter his songs have been covered by wellknown artistes he has played with every famous musician in the music industry he even wrote an award winning campaign for levis he is arespectedin the music industry he is friends and works with musicians like elvis costello blah blah i think he would be a good one to do i would like to start creating a page for him and must now try to find your notes which really helped me to create the ritz page it would be quite an ambitious job as he has been so prolific if i could start it off then i could take my time 
 i fear i cant remember but you could always either fly solo or as for another one 
 its a shame i cant have you im not ready to fly completely solo yet so shall try and get another one to save me time could you be so kind as to supply the link as to how to get another one i have really forgotten everything sorry 
 id offer if i could be sure of being here reliably the best approach is to place on your talk page with the request for guidance towards a mentor or guide there the main thing to remember is notability plus verifiability makes an article that will stand the test of time 
 thank you 
 you are welcome 
 i personally dont mind whether or not this particular afd runs the full course but it isnt a great test case for the automatic notabiity of grade ii listing if you do find a suitable test case and take it to afd id be obliged if youd notify me as id be very interested in the discussion regards 
 i missed the mea culpa ordinary gN im sure you will agree are unlikely to be notable we will let this one run its course i think our community usually makes wise decisions and i will most certainty do my very best to remember you if i find a plain old gN 
 im on the fence on grade ii on the one hand i think it does actually meet our notability and verifiability requirements and im chary of deleting goodfaith contributions which do meet these excluding the obvious problem with articles that exist to promote commercial concerns and even those can usually be salvaged on the other hand i dont think the creation of thousands of tiny hardtoimprove stubs is of merit to the project and there are privacy issues given that wikipedia is far more googleable than 
 just letting you know (since you have mentioned afding 
 should you feel the sources in the maradns article do not establish notability i found a number of mentions of maradns in peerreviewed articles including phd dissertations which i have added to 
 i will add a wikipedianbio template to the articleuN s talk page so other editors can be aware of these concerns 
 regarding 
 i know i have been incorporating that into the articles as i have written them 
 ok just checking because i felt like 
 it probably was i realized this around the time that i punched out the article and i just saw that it does read like that so i will go tackle that now 
 please could you look at this and tell me what you think 
 im not really sure why you are asking me i will form a view if the article interests me but i dont generally respond when asked to visit a deletion discussion dont take that personally i just make it a personal rule if you feel strongly and the prod is contested i suggest you take it to afd and a consensus will form 
 hi again i see that it may have appeared odd for me to ask you but i did so because i wanted some neutral input and had just spotted your name in an intervention i agreed with on a history log so that was random enough for my purposes equally i hope you wont be affronted by this offbeat logic and i certainly respect your reply its not so much the destiny of this page that concerns me as working out some general rules on when its appropriate to strongly assert sd and when to go afd i have had comments suggesting boldness on sd and others suggesting caution and preferring afd on the other hand afd particularly for a new article seems to cause enldess headaches and wikkilawyering cheers 
 not at all offended by your logic i am a team player but only on article creation and improvement also not that this applies to you i will track idiocy down and try to root it out interestingly sometimes idiots defend idiocy to the death perhaps we are heading for 
 i just want to help split 
 i simply do not find it a valid article the afd process tales five days so please argue your case for retention nomination does not always lead to deletion 
 im not sure how things became so heated in the baked goods section hopefully we can move forward with a more cooperative and collaborative approach sometimes comments dont come across as intended over the internet so i think a lot of the problem may be based on misunderstandings in my experience warrington has been pretty responsive to input and is happy to work on improving articles he seems to feel that every time he responded to your suggestions you issued new criticisms and based on this perception he became frustrated i understand there are differences over how to present some of the information but i think those can be worked out 
 thank you for lending an ear i am truly not hostile to warrington i simply feel i ought not to go anywhere near them for my own peace of mind at present but do lets get rid of this bizarre accusation please somehow 
 understood thank you for your good efforts you missed the great 
 i missed a jewish food war did it last the requisite N days 
 good one the conflict definitely inflicted some painful kicks to our kishkes we never resolved 
 probably wisest not to serve it with a glass of cold milk ah wait one sort can be and the other sort cant and you have to be so careful of the source of your schmaltz well no wonder there was a war you cannot have kosher and non kosher prepared in the same article its like kitchens 
 i even tried to invoke king solomon in asking for the kishka to remain whole but in the end we accepted a brotherhood of fraternal twins and resolved that the sibling rivalry was such that they should remain apart oy what a lot of kvetching over some sausage 
 alastair would you accept as a source that apple has admitted there are issues between ipod classics and itunes N i find it odd that are reporting issues between ipod classics and itunes N and yet it cant be mentioned on the wikipedia page simply because the complaints occur on an anonymous forum in my opinion wikipedias standards are flawed there should be some consideration given for overwhelming anecdotal evidence at least editors should be able to mention that overwhelming anecdotal evidence exists im curious how would you explain the ancedotal evidence of so many users who are experiences conflicts between ipod classics and itunes N 
 please discuss on 
 for some reason the start of the summary was deleted it should have read maybe speculation should be removed the irony will not be lost upon you 
 would love a suggestion or advice as you are more familiar with the rules 
 imagine therefore that you are researching sources for every sentence that you write not to synthesise research but simply to cite the sources its not easy 
 i think what you might do is to deploy on your talk page with your question there it is challenging when even if neutral one places stuff on wp about ones own organisation 
 alright that can definitely be arranged your rfa has not been transcluded yet for formal review would you like me to do that for you 
 alright then you will be able to see it at 
 usually N days during this time other editors will vote in your rfa to decide whether you should become an administrator 
 it is however your right to allow it to continue until either the N days are completed or until it is closed by an administrator or bureaucrat as wpnotnow at the moment you have N opposes and N neutrals with no supports i have never seen someone with your experience to successfully pass an rfa if you want to see the criteria for the kind of person which i would support have a look at 
 see my note there coi editing is not prohibited in wp its just a warning sign 
 indeed but a guy suggesting that his cv is going up next is unusual 
 finally a nice person heeeeelp me these admins are talking to me in this wikipedia talk im not even understanding i need help to understand what i need to do they keep blocking me and sending me menacing messages im not doing anything to be disruptive or purposely breaching guidelines im just not aware of them please help me out how can i go about fixing this 
 does this brain dump help 
 thanks 
 i will have a look at the article myself too it reads very much like an advertg so i can see why it was deleted i think a top to toe rewrite will be needed its very hard to write an encyclopaedia when used to writing pr etc 
 just curious as to what you meant in the edit summary by preparation to move the article has been moved back and forth several times in the past few years and the current location is where i moved it to the last time it was moved somewhere else since this has been a rather contentious issue in the past requiring among other things mediation i would ask that before moving it anywhere you bring the issue up on 
 i actually cant do anything except move it to some unique title furthermore there should be no abbreviations in the name anyways so it shouldnt be there in the first place 
 i have temporarily undeleted this so people can review the article 
 thank you 
 does it matter whether they are made with 
 will this be ironed out soon or will we have to get 
 roflmao ok what is an 
 that is more waffle than anyone should have in a lifetime 
 seems to me that you need to add a load of citations so far it looks like either a hoax or original research you also need to participate in the deletion discussion 
 if you have uploaded other files consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them too you can find a list of files you have uploaded by following unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged as described on 
 thanks i will look into it 
 all fixed i uploaded information about the source of the image as per the bots request 
 i couldnt find it online but that header led me to believe it had been copied from a text that starnge implausible title gave me reason to suspect it in the first place 
 i dont disagree i was thinking the selfsame thing it looks like advertorial too 
 it was only a split from the regular gramophone records article as i saw the notice on the top of that article so i took action it would be better to rewrite my split instead of deleting it 
 you may well be right the whole thing is a bit of a mess though interesting and informative i suspect the original author got a bit carried away it needs a lot of sourcing to be a real article afd can also spur folk into rescuing an article too 
 it isnt and it is not your page it is wikipedias page the page is inappropriate and has been proposed for speedy deletion 
 you need the page to be notable and verifiable verifiable your current edit is neither of the above is this golfer well known if so provided citations putting the tag on your talk page and asking this question will get you someone with the skills to answer your question 
 thanks for raising the issue at 
 oh sorry i totally overlooked this message it looks like others have taken care of it my apologies for the negligence 
 hi a couple of things that i thought would be best to discuss on your talk page first you seem to think that in see also sections explanatory language is verboten my understanding is the opposite specifically that the rule is editors should provide a brief annotation when a links relevance is not immediately apparent when the meaning of the term may not be generally known or when the term is ambiguous should you wish to make the annotation more brief that is of course fine but your deletion of the annotation to me would appear to be somewhat contrary to the direct guidance second spam doesnt apply here this is a highly significant matter covered worldwide thats been the subject of over N k hits on wiki a day nothing is being sold i also corrected per mos some casenames that you input litigants first names generally are not to be reflected and casenames are to be italicized furthermore im not sure if you appreciate the groundbreaking nature of the case it led us attorney michael l levy to say the issues raised by these allegations involve the meeting of the new world of cyberspace with that of physical space and led senator specter to hold a senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on the subject of privacy and telecommunications and to introduce legislation in the senate as a result thoughts 
 btw if you are going to suggest that the mos supports your argument then its generally a good idea to point to which part of the mos 
 just read your most recent edit public figures are pumped for quotes all the time legislation is changed all the time still not convinced that this article needs to be linked from half of the other articles on wikipedia 
 as to mos if we are referring what part of mos i am referring to when i refer to citation form for a casename that would be moslaw 
 with regard to your last comment above you say public figure are pumped for comments all the time perhaps i wasnt clear it is highly unusual in the us for the us attorneys office and or or fbi to comment on an ongoing investigation just the opposite of all the time that is reflected in the very article i can provide you multiple citations to that effect if you would like but it is well known in the us it is exactly the opposite of all the time second it is highly unusual for a case to spur a senate subcommittee hearing and for it to spur proposed legislation in the united states true legislation is changed all the time in this areai cant point to any legislation spurred by a particular case as this has and as specter points out this has been in need of revision for thirty years it is highly significant 
 http or or enwikipediaorg or w or indexphptitlespeciallog and useralistairmcmillan 
 i will take a look at the redirects you list many thanks as i said i had thought there were a good number of odd ones and would only favor the typical ones used in cases as discussed above lets both take a look at the facts and rejoin if you will i have a few decades experience in the area of law and am confidentfor the objective reasons cited which i can supply refs for if there are not enough in the the article for you that this is a unique case and that that is reflected in the highly unique reaction by the us attorneys office and the us senate perhaps there is a way to pare down the mentions to a barer form that we would both find acceptable could i trouble you to take a look with that in mind 
 yes i took a glance at the deleted redirects and agree with all or almost all of those i had not restored which are the bulk is there a way to check how may hits the deleted and nonrestored ones had tx 
 you could try this site http or or statsgrokse or only shows you stats a month at a time though so pretty laborious but it does seem to be pretty accurate 
 ugh perhaps when i have more time my sense is that most or all of those that remain deleted should well remain so i would not have created them and unless im missing something they are not common or intuitive names for the article i could always i guess also try a google search to check my supposition for now i think for the most part i will just let those lie dead tx for the input btw if ok w or you on some of the other see alsos i think i would like to revive them either a trimming the explanation or b mentioning the led to senate i think just a trim would likely be more to your liking but wanted to run this by you first best 
 my mistake forgot to change the name from the article i used as a template re speedy deletion is it just that the names dont match or is do you believe that there are further problems with the article 
 thankyou must double check everything in the future thanks for pointing out the mistake 
 please help me some dude called 
 i have no interest in whatever this isand have said so on N s talk page 
 hi there just a note to say that when you move opera articles to a new title make sure that you change the link in the accompanying composer navigation templates eg otherwise it will produce a circular link best 
 yup you are right although im not quite sure what you mean with a circular link it wasnt a double redirect just s single ciao or 
 is there a simple way of creating a sort thing for each of the sections to make life easier for contributors and readers alike please 
 ah i thought of that but the page is not in table format so can i have a table split itself automatically into N columns i sued a template to columnify it not a table and thse things are dynamic so the table has to auto split 
 i was afraid of that i will reactivate helpme in case someone else has further ideas there has to be a way i dont mind investing one time effort to do it but not oh god not again effort 
 roux seems to be right surprisingly few wp editors are any good at tables and there doesnt seem to be a way to do what you want there 
 we are lousy at it because of the appalling mw pipe syntax can you think of a place to ask this question in order to get the broadest set of opinions on it i dont disbelieve you nor roux but it just seems that it ought to be possible somehow that we have not spotted 
 giving it a punt at 
 as of right now has a total of N items even after a refresh as much as id love to believe thats true 
 hi fabrictramp updates on the toolserver have broken my scripts im going to have to rewrite it to get it working again but i will get it working again dont give up on me this is just a very busy time for me right now 
 i can relate thanks in advance for whatever you can do 
 done at last is up and running again 
 tim when an independent third party declines a csdtag it is a bad idea to reinstate it it is a worse idea to do so when the third party has added references to reliable sources to counter the csd nomination it is disruptive to retag a third time when notability requirements have been met thats not helping the encyclopaedia thats obstructive triggerhappiness would you consider in future taking to afd those articles whose suitability for csd is contested by third parties sincerely 
 sorry i have seen your comment at my talkpage and perhaps we were simply editing past each other 
 no worries i also got confused about who originated the article six of one and half a dozen of the other 
 these things happen 
 you came up with a good list of rhub communication article creations by various sockpuppets can you open a sock report for happysantacruz 
 listed at 
 thats fine thanks i will watch and or or comment im short on time and am impressed that you seem to understand this sock fairly well 
 id rather see it rescued than to stay deleted it certainly established notability believe me you wont hurt my feelings if you do rescue it have at it 
 go on then drop it into my userspace and i will have a crack at it 
 im not as new as you think only that i was too lazy to register an acount i have extensive edits in multiple featured articles have sucessfully campaigned for renaming and have many other minor edits please stop editing the jf page and lets have a discussion 
 perhaps the best place for a discussion is on the talk page of 
 i declined the speedy made the refs visible and removed the negative blp stuff please go through and see if i missed anything cheers 
 good job well done 
 hi i just put up a lengthy article on 
 i do have that song how do you want to get it 
 just sent the song please let me know if you got it ok 
 when filing spi cases please file under the name of the master account rather than the sock this allows us to more easily track the socking history 
 apologies for doing it wrong but this is new territory for me any chance of unjargoning that all i knew is that we had an editor running riot who needed to be stopped 
 basically in every case of sockpuppetry there is an original account that the user registered and additional accounts that were added later to evade blocks etc cases should be named after the original account 
 so in this case i suppose that would be inayat karim sorry to seem stupid i just want to get it right for the future 
 yup the idea is that for users who repeatedly sock all their sock reports will be gathered together 
 grateful i will do my best no guarantees to get it right every time though 
 hi loomN just some tips based on of yours the link 
 thanks for your tips i actually knew that but i was in a hurry so i forgot 
 it may go the way of the 
 the question is will you write an article about it and if so where or shall we hang the jumper on it 
 you could plot the coordinates of each one 
 images are thumbed so that readers can choose whether or not to see the large versions and to make pages load more quickly increasing the size of a thumbed image defeats the object 
 you will notice that a very large number of images in wikipedia are not thumbed aesthetic considerations must be taken into account and that image looks horribly ugly when thumbed it is not wikipedia policy or guideline to thumb images we must select whatever looks better please keep the image in a size sufficiently large to look good 
 that it looks horribly ugly is a matter of opinion that it causes loading of the page to slow down is a matter of fact you also keep reverting to the dubious claim about the fame of something that most readers wont have come across and a piece in odd english about another band which isnt obviously relevant in this article 
 adding my N xaN labels aside (though i think kmussers is better for the general reader more interested in 
 emails received about wiki issues are not to be released without explicit permission from the sender please refrain from doing such on 
 i fear i am not interested 
 whether you are interested or not is completely and utterly irrelevant desist and mdash 
 yet another set of unknown rules created by an elected body of the alleged great and good to beat people about the face with i have told you i am not interested wp is bureaucracy gone mad lord of the flies with manners 
 use the template and all will be well however be careful not to quote the book verbatim but use it as a reference to your words 
 btw please feel free to improve 
 hi again technical mixup this time you are sufferer please reedit seems we are working simultaneously bye 
 why dont you add a school infobox in 
 if it is not restored please userfy the article to me at 
 i think this has been carried out already if not you can grab it from the article history i wish you luck with finding good sources it deserves to be there but i cant spot the notability for it yet 
 got it and thanks the thing was kept but i will be working on it as well 
 glad to do it i have now voiced my opinion 
 fyi i voted in the poll like you asked i voted support in the poll but oppose is still winning 
 just delete it i have transferred the above to my website at lol i would be glad to transfer all afd nominations to my website for further rework will be glad to know where i can get them and mdash 
 that is up to the community not to me 
 i set up a workspace for 
 im afraid based upon history he seems to hear advice and take a little of it see my efforts on his talk page 
 oh i read the talk page and im pretty sure he dont like you one bit so i thought to throw a little oil on the waters and give him a quiet place to work let him know that help is available if asked no reason he cannot become a productive editor it was strange too he was reacting as if he was totally unaware that someone had improved the article enough so that it was kept i think it is win for wiki to have an article about the cocreator of chicken soup and will look into ways to trim out some of the motivational fluff its on my todo list 
 thanks for calling the censorship poll to my attention just to be absolutely sure we are now voting on the N nd poll the first one has been abandoned right im just asking because a lot of people seem to still be voting on the original proposal 
 we are now voting on the second poll it is an unfortunate misunderstanding that people are still voting in the first poll its my fault actually i should have been more specific in my messages would you mind leaving these users a short note on their talk page notifying them of their mistake and pointing to the second poll because of these wrong votes we are potentially getting a skewed idea of consensus here thank you 
 he kmusser you did the anticorruption convention map last november (
 thats an easy one done 
 that s weird i dont see a difference yet did you upload the correct version 
 yes its up you may need to clear your cache and reload to see it 
 well i can see you uploaded a new version of the file but india nepal etc are still not in light green upon this command as far as i can tell the image that you uploaded is exactly identical to the image of december 
 to quote the guideline however when considering adding red links to lists disambiguation pages or templates editors are encouraged to write the article first and use the wikiproject or user spaces to keep track of unwritten articles lists of allegedly notable people and business continue to be magnets for a lot of nonnotables to advertise themselves and their businesses if you want i will hold off on removing the list again but i remain strongly skeptical that articles on these allegedly notable people will even be attempted regardless brainlara does need to stop removing the tag until the article is properly sourced and needs to stop using heavily pov words like famous and valiently unless they can source those povs 
 i do not disagree with you at all about properly sourced with some lists we would have a disagreement about redlinks there but this set of lists does need to be properly referenced im by no means asking you to hold off if you feel they should go then go they must what im hoping to do is to get two editors pulling in the same direction i see tags being removed rather than redlinks being included most of these people are not globally notable and will not appear in 
 good job well done 
 it may be that simple im starting by asking the admin who deleted and salted if they will unprotect thanks 
 seems like a good outcome good job ff or timtrent 
 thanks it was by no means all me i just started it off in the right direction and even listened to people 
 you will notice that my account is no longer unjustly blocked do please take a step back from the hostile and combative attitude that you have displayed wikipedia is not a battle unless a user chooses that it be one in the future you should consider a more helpful attitude rather then assuming such hubris by judging credible work as rubbish hopefully you have learned something from our encounter and have amended your arrogant obtuse attitude good luck to you in getting other valuable contributors to wikipedia deleted and blocked surely you shall need it 
 now be very clear i have no interest in any conversation with you on any level at all your account was blocked by an administrator who was asked by another to review it on that review you were given a second chance i dont care either way whether you are blocked or not i care about the quality of articles be a good quality editor and continue or produce rubbish and get it deleted every time either is fine this is the final response that you get from me 
 this nasty 
 i wish to remain neutral in any discussion about reblocking this editor i can see where you are coming from and to a limited extent where he is coming from this matter is now for others to judge what i will not do is delete the diatribe from the talk page nor my archives i have a firm personal policy of leaving all attacks in place 
 if you agree never to spam again i am more than happy to lift the block immedietely just mention it here 
 i did not spam anyone as you can see that many people were actually benefited by my messages instead of being annoyed i will never spam anyone but if you consider my previous actions to be spamming i can not agree to not repeat them 
 im not here to argue about the definition of spam or disruption but out of curiosity how did you select the people to send messages to 
 when i noticed the message to me i immediately thought about my userboxes one automatically puts me into 
 hi timtrent move to commons and delete is my normal method for image like thisorphaned and unlikely to become used soon but good enough to keep otherwise the debate would close as keep but move to commons and sit here for a long timewhile those on other language sites are deprived of its utility 
 i worked that out it is a pretty poor image though it was uploaded by the subject of the photo as self puffery for an article that was deleted i think it a shame that you went to the effort of moving it to commons bit that was your decision and im not going to argue with it 
 if schumin has deleted your article then it is impossible for it ever to return you could attempt an appeal but this will result in the admins closing ranks around you it really would be a pointless waste of time and before long you would be banned indef for trolling wikipedia is effectively run by sad little men with no personal lives whatsoever the admin cadre will never back down and are intent on running this place into a narrow minded buraucracy id advise you and anyone else whos ever had the experience of dealing with one of wikipedias more egregious and pathetic admins to buy a brittanica subscription this place is beneath contempt 
 please do not litter my talk page with venom i am not interested in your attacks against another editor 
 the man is an ingrate a fool he listens not to reason but to his own flabby inhibitions 
 a number of people attested to the fact that the messages werent unwanted and disputed the claim of disruption and the application of an editing block i think that at the very least this should be discussed (perhaps at 
 i will add my name to the list of people who appreciated the message two more points first this is a discussion we should have had before loomN was blocked not after second the block happened within a day of sam korns rfc being deleted by phil welsh over a technicality the rfc was based on sam korns action deleting an image a move that already violated policies on consensus and would easily fall under the proposed censorship policy on which a vote was being held if nothing else these two events together created a bad i dunno aura or 
 aye agreed 
 yup 
 could you perhaps aid me in my attempt to restore good relations with schumin all i want is for him to recognise i exist and i will disappear the conflict we had was over a year and a half ago where he really displayed all the worse traits of a wikipedia admin he refused to explain his position without the aid of a template or basically to act like a sentiant human being perhaps you can help anything would help at this stage regards 
 i suggest most strongly that you place a conciliatory message on the right user page i do not know schumin and i do not get involved in disputes between users 
 hey thanks for telling me you can add those citations for 
 oh i did all i want to do with it it can take its chance now 
 slimvirgin changed policy by unilaterally rewording two parts of nor to fit a definition favorable to a debate she was engaged in with another user i objected to this definition as it existed because it could be abused by editors in and endless game of catchyou which would lead to endless debates and edit wars over synthesis i then modified her contribution to try to bring balance and asked the community there to engage in a consensus forming poll or collaboration to ferret out our two versions to form a compromise version keep her version keep my version or to keep the original whatever consensus said would remain instead of civil discourse this user resorted to name calling accusations of a persons edit number an elitist attitude towards new editors etc etc it all can be readthis lead to a revert war where i went overboard to try to protect the original version before any changesuntil consensus could be reached as the page itself says that consensus is needed for any changes of substance i was blocked for this an arbcom member unblocked me when i expressed the sentiments above to him and the desire to revert no more as it is not useful even though i was trying to uphold policy and that i gave him my word on this which i keep my word while i was blocked the same said editor then decided to debate my version by distorting it i could not respond even though the before said arbcom member unblocked me i still have not responded on my word to him not to get to lengthythats it in a nutshell there is no consensus for change the original version should stay until consensus is reached and civil debate or polling should commence to ferret out differences so far this has not happened best wishes 
 you officially recommended that i start a rfc or rfa how do i do this in order to conclude the debate officially on nor for all intent and purposes 
 once again i request speedy deletion of the page 
 i am not an administrator please bring thing up in a relevant forum whcih you can find by instering the charactwsrs on your own talk page along with your request i have no interest in this matter 
 ok thanks and sorry for disturbing you 
 atlast i was right once again sorry for disturbence 
 i am never worried about being disturbed i just dont do politics 
 ps you received these suggestions because your name was listed on 
 thanks twinkle can be a real pain sometimes when i checked what it had or had not done it seemed to have done precisely nothing so i left it mea culpa 
 i took the books into account but i didnt base my closure entirely on them i said the subject is clearly notable as evidenced by the books among other things regardless consensus was to keep the article so i feel my decision was accurate uN 
 fair enough i have clarified my rationale uN 
 in your edit summary your citation includes subject appears to be a nonnotable person may i suggest a more neutral and less offputting subjects notability has not been established article creators are less likely to take offense and the afd process they are likely to face is stressful enough cheers 
 it is an automated edit summary which i have no control over additionally the user actually threatened legal action and blackmail against me over email after i declined it so i dont think that they were emotionally harmed by that summary just angry note a notice that they placed on the page after i declined it which essentially questioned my intelligence i encouraged them in a reply to work on it and it seems like they did so i think that this entire issue is dead now 
 hello timtrent and thanks for your work patrolling new changes i am just informing you that i have deleted a page you tagged (
 i have no concerns about accidentally choosing an incorrect criterion since the process pits the suggestion before a competent admin who will then make an informed decision one cannot get it right every time however hard one tries 
 firstly there is no simple wikipedia article for 
 i find that i have nothing to add to my edit summary the article is concise the edit summary was civil dummyfriendly was your phrase 
 simply being concise doesnt mean its clear and the leap from dummy to simple english targeted at beginning english speakers was yours and yours alone uN 
 if you were correct then i would agree with you do you often start fights 
 no cant say that i do but rarely do i find an edit summary so obnoxious that i feel as though i have to comment i dont wish to get into an argument over this any more than i imagine you do so i will let you be but it couldnt be harmful to not only think before you commit edit summaries that could others could take exception to but also be a tad more open to the opinions and concerns of others when they raise them uN 
 i would like to thank you for giving me valuable advice 
 there you go with that flippancy again you must be charming to hang around ok well see you around uN 
 there is no pleasing you is there you pick a fight and even when thanked you still throw punches 
 and do not worry much about reliable sources on eastern wetlands its there see some soutces cired in 
 do not always worry about creating a great article right from the start begin with considerable content build up graduallyv others will contribute gradually i may sound pedantric but its really cool way its not disgraceful to start a stub if it has good verifiable content you may search through the kolkatarelated topics in see also section of 
 thank you so very much kmusser for updating and fixing the montserrat map it is so much better now i really appreciate your work on that map 
 wow thanks for catching that it doesnt go further north but it does go further west i only had N or N the province 
 yeah well so i created this stupid stub care to review it your valuable and constructive criticism is sought in this regard thanks 
 its a nice start you may want to consider taking a look at the format devoloped at 
 you have to admit he has a cool pic on his user page 
 sad but true 
 is the page showing up on sites that scrape content from wikipedia if so you will have to wait for them to refresh their content i would bring the question up at 
 hi on N april N you made way for disambiguation by moving 
 googling david hare i just found were you thinking of him 
 please do not add advertising or inappropriate external links to wikipedia{{#ifsturmeyarcher or as you did in 
 i think that you need to learn what vandalism is before making accusations my actions will stand up to community scrutiny will yours 
 advice to admins includes being cautious about speedily deleting an article on grounds of nonnotability when a number of editors have edited it which might in effect create a time limit 
 no again no time limit many afds are opened on articles that have been around for a long time the only limitation of opening an afd is that it should be opened in good faith (ruling out afds that violate 
 you are being notified because you participated in a previous afd regarding this article either at 
 i have no idea who this person is i have strong doubts that he is notable please look at and and use the cite button 
 no other article is relevant either 
 additionally please learn how to use section headings on talk pages everything is not a new section 
 i recall placing a speedy deletion template on an article and then warning the originator for removal of that notice when i flagged the article for deletion it was very different from the article as it is now as for biting newcomers the answer is that i did not and do not 
 for a newomer our tags are often rather daunting and they dont always understand what is going on and as you just experienced getting such a tag on your talk page makes you feel irritated at least i have placed a note on the talk page with some tips to avoid her getting into this kind of problems more often having said this even the very first version of the article in question which you tagged for speedy N min after its creation does not really look very promotional in tone to me having said all this i also do some new page patrolling from time to time and given the amount of egregious advertising and selfpromotion that one then encounters i also sometimes get a wee bit too trigger happy and am apt to lose my patience with newbies engaging in this kind of behavior happy editing 
 there comes a point i agree when one may go with a tag too far one may also wish that a new editor were also one who had dipped their toe into the water first and created articles second however much one may wish that there is always a small core of folk who plunge in instead of getting wet slowly in the global scheme of things this doesnt matter but of course in the global scheme of things wikipedia is unimportant too 
 on user bofgokfhvvhbfggggjguhvkhghfgs talk page i noticed you put a tag that reads blocked for repeated abuse of editing priveliges this could be misleading because the user had only made one contribution and was blocked for the users username thanks 
 good point its a generic tag i will try to find a better one uN 
 i think is the one you are looking for 
 the help i would like is in removing this item from the history on the basis that it can be considered to be defamatory i am obviously not able to do this myself 
 done feel free to take a look at 
 agh apologies i removed one revision and neglected to remove intermediate revisions between that one and your revert should be fixed now beginners mistake sounds like i need some more sleep uN 
 ~passes you a soft silk pillow~ thanks 
 hi jjron i want to thank you for your help with promoting the wayne gretzky image and i was also wondering if you could give your opinion about another hockey image this cropped image show two players (
 well the image you saw was cropped at a N toN format often used for online news there is more information above and below the players in the noncropped version i will upload it later and then you will get a better idea of how it looks but my concern is regarding the composition imo the image is encyclopedic since you can see how the players position them self and their sticks for a faceoff but i can understand if non hockey fans dont find it encyclopedic since they only see part of the players 
 here is higher resolution version 
 no worries it was just a possibly that came to mind 
 anonemouse thanks for the clarification note i used the speedy deletion template from the wiki page for porn star monique demoan as the basis for my edits can you tell me what specific tags that i should have used 
 also dont go throught and list a huge swath of articles all at once as you can see all that does is irritate people and make them not like you hope that clarifies things for you

 actually i have received praise for removing what many people find to be a hugely embarrassing part of wikipedia every article is now loosely associated with prime time television and adult cartoons this is unacceptable many other people have concurred with this sentiment and thanked me for removing this fluff from wikipedia i will continue to do so regardless of your wishes i dont believe this constitutes vandalism and will take this up with administration if you continue this line of debate 
 take it up with administration then do that now praise from many people is not consensus your edits are part of a 
 hello timtrent i am just letting you know that i declined the speedy deletion of 
 no it doesnt it will have to be afd then 
 number N 
 just letting you know that malik speedied the article anyway the claim of a charted hit was false ten pound hammer his otters and a cluebat uN (
 i thank you and your intelligent critters 
 you are wasting your time because you will not find any the information i have provided is largely firsthand insider information it will not figure in any authoritative journals the unreferenced banner you inserted is merely the kneejerk reaction of an indoctrinated dont know contributor i am a do know contributor i dare say the level of your wiki indoctrination will not allow you to accept that if so more fool you 
 if they are not referenced then since this is an encyclopaedia they must go you may not like it but wikipedia is not concerned with truth it is concerned with referenced information 
 now i know you are an idiot i care not for wikipedia any more i dont care what you do and after seeing the remark above i dont care what you think when you have grown up you will realise 
 please visit 
 did you look at my delete request closely enough to understand what i was attempting to do the article about the short story should be located at 
 have you looked at the 
 all help gratefully received since the template is quite complex and the templating language is arcane i suggest you only help me if you truly know what you are doing otherwise the scope for driving yourself nuts is huge 
 i think i fixed it uN just doesnt accept parameters higher than N so you have to either copy what does or use it like i did also the template isnt the best way to get answer to such technical questions as this one 
 how gloriously simple thank you and thank you for the advice on the way to get help too 
 your ideas of discussion and consensus are rather intriguing they seem to be focused around making threats of deleting others contributions and calling edits mindless vandalism 
 can be found in articles such as 
 i would suggest you resist the temptation it goes counter to the expectation of those who then become against the template instead trust categories it is reasonable where appropiate to create a link like 
 there are quite a few with all N in anyway such as 
 one knows when one has been successful when other editors take over quite some time ago i started and others made it fly i hope for this here the more so since my interest is only as a disgusted onlooker as a gay man who feels defiled by these damned catholic priests mainly abusing boys and as a wp editor who is a fan of good articles and templates

 actually i was in india for N months i came back yesterday to canada 
 me too 
 has your movie come out yet 
 yeah it released in nandan the reception was exceptional by nandan standards we hit house full in the third day we grossed N in a week in a N seater hall even with virtually no publicity for comparison the heavily publicized manush bhoot running in the N seater grossed N in N weeks we were not given extension due to political reasons 
 gewikstatspolizei no no and a thousand times no ve haff vays of making you obey i do not appreciate that kind of racism yeah i know some of my ancestors were racist and created a police state so what the british had slavery the americans had a whole load of stuff the russians had stalinism etc but you dont see anybody going around stereotyping against them for some ugly parts of their history these kinds of jokes were what allowed things like the holocaust to happen in the first place furthermore i would like to inform you that almost the entire polish part of my family was brutally murdered by the waffenss and this is not a thing to be made fun of thank you 
 please try not to over react to humour your suggestion provoked my reaction 
 can i ask why you restored the rada alumni section to this article please i go to kings and can safely say that rada alumni are certainly not considered to be nor do they consider themselves kings alumni the notable alumni section on the kcl website only includes those who studied at kings or at one of the several institutions to have subsequently merged with kings 
 note that i have removed this section from the article once more and provided an explanation on the talk page i hope this is sufficient 
 such a change should be explained by rather more than an edit summary saying i dont think when such inclusions are not consistent across the board hence the restoration until an explanation was given 
 hi i noticed that you have posted on talk page about his deletion of pop culture sections without discussion attempts to wikify or sufficiently detailed edit summaries you may be interested that i have brought this to the attention of the admins 
 please dont take the trouble of replying unless you have a substantial portion of humble pie to eat 
 thank you for at least explaining how you came to this conclusion however i am perfectly familar with the idea of paraphrasing and therefore this doesnt really help at all i have always omitted unnecessary words and used multiple sources where they are available the section which you questioned is extremely short the content of the sources used is extremely long two other editors have since indicated that they are happy with my contributions mathematics would not be my strongest field of study but i still know that this does not add up i dont know what else to say i cannot tolerate false accusations of such an extreme nature and i cannot tolerate pointless disruptive demoralising arguments 
 again just to try and help you prevent this problem in the future none of what you have said above actually addresses the matter for example omitting unnecessary words from a source does not help prevent plagiarism you need to change the entire style of writing using multiple sources can help one avoid plagiarism but it is not a guarantee you can use ten sources and still plagiarize from one of them finally you can plagiarize a short section from a long source this is still plagiarism plagiarism does not constitute copying an entire text it is copying any part of a source without quotation marks and proper attribution 
 how is her personal website spammy and unacceptable 
 hello you said to contact you for information about why you want to delete my page here i am i can work on the references however they would connect to italian and or or spanish sources > said it be be because i am not known in the united states i hope that is not the case as it would seem quite superficial please tell me what i need to do so my page will not be canceled thank you user talkkayrush kay rush 
 you may not be watching this page i will drop you a note there to tell you that i have replied here 
 i have now read your comments at the deletion discussion from my perspective they add weight to the argument that you are using the encyclopaedia for publicity you say i only wanted the page in my mother tongue for people who do know me in the united states im afraid your own wishes for the article are irrelevant to wikipedia if it is justified in english it will should it be deleted this time be created in english 
 i will comment here at the sake of being redundant with the afd comment that her usage of my in relation to an article about herself is well within sensible usage i would refer to an article about me as my article and a picture of me as my picture regardless of who created the work in question 
 you are hilarious i wasnt saying her edits should be allowed to continue i was merely saying that you could try assuming (in the spirit of 
 i have paid attention as ever to not only the policy you cite but to the others that you seem to avoid perhaps a good approach would be for you to mentor this editor and work with her in order to see if you can create an article that will stick that would seem to me to be what rescuing articles that are salvageable is about i have done this myself where i have seen a glimmer of hope and yes we worked around coi but those occasions were not blatant advertising just poor articles blp must be notable and verifiable no exceptions 
 im not ignoring wpv and wpn i understand their importance i simply dont agree that four months of verifytag and a halfdozen editors searching during an afd is sufficient to say no one will ever source this i have a problem with the assumption that failing wpv cascades to failing wpn i also believe it is inappropriate to tell me that in order to be justified in calling to keep an article that i must then back it up with hours of work exhausting all the sources i have for an article i dont even care about wpv can wait when there are marginal sources which establish a reasonable possibility of reliable sources globally if wpburden was the killer of wpatd then the verifytag wouldnt be listed im honestly exhausted by the feeling that i must spend time in the afds periodically to see what deletionists are trying to kill off because there isnt an academic article at their fingertips i suggested that this article be brought to the attention of a relevant wikiproject i watched to see if someone who wanted to delete it would bother to do what i consider good practice and i am not surprised that no one bothered then finally when i do post a source halfheartedly at N or N am you appear to be casting preemptive doubt on any more sources i might find via google books this frustrates me because it is unfathomable to me that wikipedia has become the success it is in spite of the presence of so many imperfect but varied articles rather than because of it and this really ought to signal another lull for me because i cant handle it i just dont have the calm 
 what length of time would be enough N N N N months a year two years neither deletion nor rescue should ever become a fetish they are just tools article quality is paramount 
 i just wanted to say thanks for the time and trouble you took to help this user this is the sort of assistance that i wish everyone could get with their first article i took the trouble to look up the relevant standard found at 
 a total pleasure where someone is trying i try in return not always but often enough i hope there is some assistance you could be not to me but to the community i lodged an issue at ani which has now come close to the top of the current incidents page which could do with an uninvolved admin to run a ruler over it with a view to summarising and closure the issue is complex and is 
 hey do you go on orkut 
 yes im on orkut under loomN but i dont go there often not much to do 
 we seem to be reverting back and forth on the hf structure and bonding so lets talk the hf bonds in hf are not equivalent based on diffraction studies do you read the information diffferently the monographs and the technical reports read to me that the two hf distances are quite disparate please provide citations for your assertion and we can improve the article together and we will benefit cheers and looking forward to your response 
 i concur with smokefoots remark could you provide references with your changes when you reinsert them thank you 
 or is this a temporary visit 
 hey thanks just noodling around a little 
 hey there id love to see you around more too 
 dude its been a while hope to see you around more as well 
 im not running a mile i asked you if there was a service you wanted and you answered so im on the hook i have looked over the long history of 
 i think that is a perfectly sound process to go through i had to unarchive the thread just now so i assume ani is intended for high discussion loads and for fast work 
 i looked at the comment you just removed from this discussion i think i understand why you removed it but i still think it does you credit and i feel roughly the same way if anything further arises as a result of this for instance if 
 it was timing only that made me feel the need to remove it i left my thoughts too late and it became superfluous it is sufficient that they are in the page history and he may read them if he chooses thanks for the compliment and thank you for bringing the events to a close so simply it was not i think entirely simple to achieve 
 as per a recent discussion on my talk page and elsewhere i have amended the editing restrictions to make it perfectly clear to the user in question that he can blocked for infringing them thanks for keeping me in the loop on this 
 this license permits #N but does not permit #N and does not permit #N 
 thanks but i still dont see where it forbids modification it just doesnt mention it if we had to choose since it specifically says reproduction not just distribution i would think it would allow modification since most reproductions do inevitably modify the product and incorporate it in another context does such a license need to explicitly allow modification 
 the basic copyright statement forbids everything except a few specific uses giving away the one copy you have and certain limited forms of copying as permitted under 
 calling other editors loonies is not acceptable please reread what you wrote and consider revising it to comply with 
 it seems perfectly civil to me but thank you for your concern 
 by the way who has self identified as a loony and is also an editor here go read the comment again and then consider withdrawing your uncalled for remark i refer to those who think there are paedophiles hiding under every bush frankly your message is itself bordering on the uncivil 
 thanks 
 can you remove references to the N rd nomination from the second thanks 
 not in any straightforward manner see below 
 make a 
 or 
 oops thanks for pointing out the mistake i have fixed it now 
 i nominated for deletion 
 csd seems to have done it 
 well the best bet would be to csd the N rd nomination with twinkle though i guess you already dealt with it 
 it wasnt obvious but was a good bet thanks 
 you 
 i was just about to drop by and thank you the formal closure is likely to mean that it does not return to the metallurgy title now it can move forward to whatever better title may come 
 if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding hangon to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines lastly please note that if the page does get deleted you can contact one of these admins to request that they userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you ukexpat N N july N 
 i have answered on your talk page 
 please try not to be silly wikipedia is a global thing no state is powerful enough to infiltrate it i have no relationship with your cause for it or against it please do not try to involve me in your politics 
 i would like to enter a statement or concern that every time we seem to get to some sort of concensus about the neverending rfc an editor decides that we will take the discussion to a new phase i observe that this medcab request comes without notifying several people who have expressed concern that this procedure is being owned by one editor and not accepting the fact that the community is expressing desire to modify the viewpoint the owner is taking if this goes forward i would like to be included in the review track group that was suggested as i have concerns that in its current owners hands this procedure will be viewed with hostility 
 hm alright ok it does seem like there is insufficient consensus for the mediation process to proceed at this stage thank you for informing me 
 indeed and that concern is shared by many the issue is that the phases and what not have typically been on the whim of a single user indeed that is how the mediation request also appears the straw poll following the end of the trial was set up solely by offN riorob the following straw poll by jimbo wales the first two phases of the rfc were set up by no one except beeblebrox however this phase which is currently live was all discussed beforehand and was only added due to a consensus that it should be the next step forward you can view all the discussion on the talk page where we perfected the wording options format etc 
 i am hoping to wake up shortly and discover that the entire filed case and commentary is actually some horrid nightmare 
 thats a creative way to put it as for me the entire month of october was the nightmare 
 heh i suspect you werent quite prepared for the knack we have of converting pages into footlong debates in a matter of minutes all the same thanks for your input and friendly welcoming manner 
 name the monkeys in question and we will analyze this d 
 im sure you can understand after todays events why i am completely exasperated with all this i sincerely thank you for your willingness to step into what has obviously become a very contentious and confusing situation as of now i am not participating in this process any further and as nobody seems to want to go the mediation route you may consider the request withdrawn thank you again for your efforts 
 well a first on many measures the first sitewide mediation attempt is now the shortest ever sitewide mediation attempt and first to be requested withdrawn within a day while i still think mediation at the discussion would be helpful it sounds like many agree that the mediation channel isnt the place for this i am now observing after not being involved for about an hour getting slightly ridiculous this is hopefully we can proceed calmly forward 
 i declined the speedy deletion of 
 i am perfectly content with that 
 okay sounds good i didnt realize you had already commented as fiddle faddle there regards 
 if its so notable and important why are they unable to prove it 
 i refer you to the section at the top of my talk page everyone know that within N days of my birthday i may not be criticized lol~ 
 i think he is the guy who became so notorious as a headteacher who got off on beating school children that it helped to speed the banning of corporal punishment in schools doesnt sound like he ever got prosecuted but you could still consider it an abuse case 
 it was lawful thus is unlikely to qualify it was even an unexpected behaviour technically he would not be an abuse case even were it to qualify for other reasons because he would be a perpetrator assuming the allegations are founded 
 i have taken your hoax tag off it isnt see 
 http or or wwwdailymailcouk or debate or articleN or astrangelonelytroublingdeathhtml says internet businessman blowed if i know 
 the man exists the hoax is that he is an internet businessman not an actor back to you frankly he is only notable for being gatelys partner 
 hell of a lot of refs for businessman is there anything to conclusively say he aint 
 i think we are missing in the middle when i flagged the article as a hoax it said he was an actor the editor who created it altered the gately article to say so too the crowles article also has no real content i think you might reconsider the fact that it is truly a hoax 
 well the bit about him and gately is true they were married i dont think he is notable but wondered what the creator was going to come up with how about a redirect to gateley your keyboard or mine 
 have a look at 
 i would say we have a very unusual editor here 
 no more blocked for socking and hoaxing 
 hello im just curious but why are you cheers
 try not to be when my rfa failed i was pissed for a few minutes but then i thought you know what i should listen to these guys and try to improve my editing then i will make an even better admin than when i was first nominated and personally i do think eddie is right you should try to see if you can get a vandal to chnage his mind i think im serious i know someone who used to be a vandal and hes a good contributor today cheers
 hey i noticed that you are interested in aviation you might wanna join 
 im a member of wikiproject aircraft actually cheers
 thanks for 
 my initial objective was to start with something it is always easier to start with a base on which to build than on a blank page 
 hi you may want to untemplate pmN his edit was not vandalism thanks 
 i warned this editor informally for this edit previously now i have warned them formally i will warn for the same edit made in the future as well those are the breaks 
 in all seriousness and as someone who is just as committed to fighting bullying as you are and just as aware of its potential consequences as you are i think you made a very minor mistake here vandalism is vandalism someone perhaps being wrong about what is bullying and what is not bullying is a problem and that should be fixed but you should not call it vandalism when it is not vandalism that just undermines all of the efforts being made to stop bullying 
 there is a history here this editor has repeatedly made this edit without any attempt to discuss it has been asked not to do so and has been told what will happen should he continue to do so he makes the same edit repeatedly from time to time he does not respond and consensus is impossible to start to achieve because of this thus the only conclusion i can draw is that it is no longer possible to assume good faith and that it is vandalism that this is an editor with a long and decent track record does not make it any less of a vandalism edit im afraid 
 presto another brilliant avillidea 
 is that programmatically possible another eagle question 
 ok i guess i should rephrase amidaniel are you willing to program according to that scheme should i trade mark this too 
 oh boy i dont knowi think id prefer to stick to the old kiss philosophy here while i appreciate avillias suggestion it sounds like an awful lot of work im going to toy around with my idea of the forced removal list and see if i have any luck there if my method winds up being implausible i will reconsider the above thanks for your suggestions 
 hey just thought i should inform you that i have tagged an image you uploaded 
 i went ahead and replied on the talk page thanks for clearing things up and #N uN 
 resolved thanks for the heads up i wouldnt have noticed so quickly without it 
 cute 
 which is not to say that your criticism is unfounded of course 
 i got a suppose 
 or hello anonemouse i wanted to squeak you a very special thank for your support at my 
 thanks its actually ni puha ni pera and it would be appropriate before the rfa not after its been successful but thanks anyway we wont argue we will just exchange ideas lol 
 i noticed an edit of yours on the history page for cerveru in the list of megaman zero characters and i scoped out your userpage in curiosity i noticed one of your intrests was megaman of course as a mm fanatic i couldnt help but be interestedwhat do you think of the megaman articles on wikipedia 
 its nice to hear constructive critisisim may i ask whats wrong with the standardization of the articles and if you need someone to talk to about reguarly editing the articles that would be me i check and edit them just about everyday speaking of which i was the one who created all of the character page links as well as being responsible for the boss characters page and the articles cateregory listing as a whole the oringinal megaman zero page used to look like this 
 in the near future i will also do a huge overhall to the x series characters page as well 
 i see well the classic series is where it all began correct i have taken a look at the classic articles and i have to say i agree with you though i never really liked the original series from a gameplay standpoint i am well versed in the games characters and storyline i will overhall the articles for you to conform to a quality equal to the zero series as for the battle network spinoff thats pretty much doneme and wolf odonnell overhalled those articles awhile ago see my articles on 
 agreed tell me when you are ready to start so we can begin together as the old saying goes many hands make the work go faster 
 yet another article rescued from deletion how icteritious 
 well what about the thousands of mlb players back to the N s today one at bat and someone writes a stub but from the N s we have articles on a dozen of baseballers same difference 
 btw spelling bee is a uniquely anglophone concept as far as i understand in russia there has never been such a thing even just generally at school to say nothing of televised 
 minimum yearly contract at mlb is $N k pa divide by N games is how much youd make if you were released after one atbat 
 the whole point of the 
 uN 
 ah no i simply forgot to add it back after organizing the material if you want add it back but respect style ciao 
 hmmmm titles of movies should be in italics say 
 i believe what hibana is infering to is indeed the chip listing that information is much more suited for my friend furthurmore i was the one who had reverted in the past when you made the list concerning its messiness which you did indeed correct however the chip information is stat info which does not contribute overall to the article however i will link the mmn N page to the 
 no because it is predominantly not about an element of fiction thats what i have been trying to say its information about the game information we should have this may not be the optimal way to organize the info but its the one we have and will likely have for some time because of the relative scarcity of experienced retrogaming editors and because yours truly still has that dangerously erratic thing going on that i have been trying to kick it beats not having that information presented to the readers at all so on that basis with this not being the kind of fiction article that you have been concerned about and hoping to not drag out a minor matter i have undone the redirection i hope that you agree with this reasoning so that we come to an amiable conclusion cheers 
 this 
 of course perhaps anon y mouse was sent consistent with 
 splutter choke cough lol 
 oh and you really should move these barnstars onto your userpage you deserve to show them off 
 in response to your thanks you are very welcome also that was a quick reply i didnt expect you to know it was there so soon 
 whats this why itsno it cant be hibanas a mad woman a mad woman shes gone mad and made extreme amounts of contributions to the zero character pages as well as fixing my abundent spelling mistakes and grammer here take this barnstar to calm you down 
 this user has already been blocked for personal attacks so many times both under the present username as well as 
 hello anonemouse i too was a bit puzzled as i mentioned on 
 you claimed that 
 thanks for your fair consideration of my position it was greatly appreciated id give you a barnstar but i cant find the right one 
 thank you for some more clarity on other issues of ffvii go to this 
 what about me 
 i am sorry that it did not do well( i have full faith you would have done well but i guess the community did not do not get to offended by the criticism and learn from it try to write a ga article that would be a major help also wait at least N months before trying again i am sure you will be an admin in the future cheers 
 i agree with the above i am somewhat dismayed by the failure of your rfa although i realise it is your N rd nomination imo that shouldnt really be a reason to oppose unless of course the user in question has not learnt from any criticism in the past i fully believe that you will become a sysop in later months good luck with the retry which should undoubtedly happen regards 
 please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload remember that images without this important information can be deleted by an administrator you can get help on image copyright tagging from 
 i simply neglected to include the promotional template in the licensing section of the image file i have switched it and if its still a problem you may want to address this issue with all the other 
 ty for the disambiguation in the ryan seacrest article it was bothering me kudos shalom 
 thanks much for the note 
 hi roger i have no doubt the book exists it simply hasnt garnered the amount of attention necessary to merit inclusion in the wiki per 
 you dont need to get my permission i just nominated the article for deletion and it was approved i must say though i dont agree with the 
 wonderful i suspected you were a 
 i understand your concern however with the exception of the grabby and the gay avn awards im not sure any of the others survive however they were important in their day it will be difficult to write articles on them finding information will prove problematical im sure im in touch with the owner of the grabby awards the original owner died and they are in the process of updating the website i cant even get stats for that award and its still being given i will give it my best shot but dont be surprised when the articles get afdd in the meantime i will take out the links im working on more stats for the talk portion of the page thanks and mdash 
 i have attempted to roll all the past awards up into this article 
 thanks i felt the info was important to have for reference sake and finally came up with a way to not have little homeless stubs running around have good days and mdash 
 well to be honest i didnt really think about it when i linked to 
 hi hibana i have already taken the iniative to mend the copyright info for you 
 i will see what i can do but it is unlikely i will be able to do anything over the next few days as i am tackling a few essay assignments 
 hello hibana im working on a project right now and i was wondering if i could inquire for your asistance its 
 i see well im not too comfortable with making it an article as of yet the entire list of classic mega man skills has yet to be filled in and i find that quite unacceptable im working on this laborous task as we speak and it would be grand to have a bit of help thank you for the reply as well 
 update i have completed the list and moved it into articlespace 
 may i inquire an second opinion 
 hey did you ever notice those interesting anon edits made on the final fantasy viii page last night i fixed them and gave the anon a message but it fooled me for a few minutes i was actually copyediting one of the parts lol 
 your welcome i must say though those were some strange edits 
 whats doing mousie working on anything exciting 
 me the usual lawyers rabbis and shortpages always the same thing i will accept once a few more conoms come in jenna for fa are there published biographies of this celebrity lol 
 you had participated back in february in 
 i had seen but i now see you have already changed you code for later redirects 
 thanks and mdash 
 any thoughts if you dont think this would fly do you have any other ideas about how to avoid duplicate effort thanks and mdash 
 hi do you recall when we discussed the mega man classic series well i have finally freed enough time to work on them i ceated many new pages and templates (such as 
 so may i ask what you think of the new articles constructed 
 well please dont insert them in just yet i think it might be a better course of action to ask the project on thier talkpage beforehand as they might not take active participation evicerating the point of the template inclusion an example would be the 
 i have also commented on this drv in which i strong suggest against a blank and rebuild solution if you could comment further it would be great 
 sorry the above comment wasnt intended for you 
 theres a blow to my self esteem

 let me know if you think of anything else and is it just me or was that last poster on the fac particularly brutal xd 
 hey i thought id let you know that im going to go ahead and try to turn some of those pages into stubs now 
 thanks for the assist with the stubs hibana i think we have got them all now anything else you think we should work on 
 thanks for the offer the biggest weakness i have right now is copyediting so if you could help with that it would be much appreciatednot much text yet so it should be straight foreword 
 sorry am in the the process but just been frozen out by the server for about N minutes back in now relisting anew seems best given the rewrite 
 thats the relist done was annoying to be shut out halfway thru hopefully it didnt affect the relisting which no doubt you will have a look at as you seem to be interested in keeping the article i would think this relist works for you as the afd could easily have been left open by any number of admins only to be closed as delete by one who didnt fancy the article imo the references look decent but its generally not a subject area i tend to get involved in hence my abstention 
 hi i have been looking at the 
 while i am familiar with that guideline i believe that to specifically refer to the listing of actual guides on wikipedia not a link to a guide however i do see your point in that nearly all the guides listed were duplicates so i support the removal of those listings however i believe the link to the fft online game should stay as it is not a guide but a fanmade game based on fft would you agree to leave that link there along w or the other important links thanks for the message 
 this is an automated notice by 
 fixed it ~ 
 hi there i would appreciate it if you could reword your evidence a bit the revert war on wpn is hardly relevant to this case other than that i would definitely agree with codifying existing practice in wpchild but there are two fundamental points where wpchild differs from existing practice first it is based on the us coppa law and nonlawyers such as ourselves should leave law to the lawyers second more importantly wpchild calls for preventative blocking of child accounts current practice to my knowledge does not agree with that yours 
 i would like blocking editors for legal issues was what sparked the pedophilia war earlier this year and blocking any child who didnt vandalize or somesuch would likely be controversial by the way other issues against wpchild that have been mentioned is that it is disputed whether the problem it asserts to solve actually exists part of that problem is an assumed liability to coppa law which is not based on a lawyers understanding and it is disputed that wpchild solves the ethical problem of protecting children 
 fair enough thanks 
 this is a discussion probably not good on an evidence forum since the points i made are my opinion and not necessarily yours i will add them to my evidence section 
 put more simply this page came up on foundationl as having issues we need to address those issues you know as well as anyone that the aim is collaboration and not simple reversion if you can suggest what you find inaccurate or unfixable or why you disagree these are improvements on the talk page id appreciate it thanks 
 i have provided a list of factual errors on the policy talk page the grammatical problems are more than i have time to explain much less fix i really dont like editing community policy pages while sitting as an arbitrator but im not going to sit idle while you continue to mess them up especially when you often introduce subtle pov under the guise of copy editing i will revert whenever i see pov grammar style or factual errors like many of us you are better at spotting the errors in other peoples writing and cant see them in your own writing please take your time get consensus and phrase things neatly any time you dont do this we see a stream of consecutive edits and it is very hard to watch use diff and preview ffs you are not a newbie 
 as for preview i selfedit a lot even if i have used preview there is often stuff that only jumps out after id like it to be otherwise and i have acknowledged it before and surely will in future however thats how it is 
 thats why i reedit my own words one short post previewed yet even so it contains two possible bases for misunderstanding or hostility if misjudged best avoided either way a case in point to explain how it happens and why editing sometimes seems a good idea 
 i dont want to be involved in your internal thought processes while you figure out how to word your messages to other people or what are surely large improvements to policy i dont want to see each iteration nobody does we all screw up occasionally but you almost always start with a screwed up edit and then you gradually fix it one edit at a time then your edits stop they stop before you have finished fixing it anyone watching starts to wonder when you will resume 
 rather than coming here and telling me how to suck eggs and how wonderful your policy writing skills are how about you read the 
 the edit summary doesnt contain space to explain thats what the talk page is for how often do we tell users take it to the talk page you know that the words see talk page and thats what was missing when you revert obvious goodfaith edits with thought behind them its helpful to provide some detail and lazy not to in this case the later addition of the bulleted list has helped in explaining the concerns 
 are you going to undertake to fix this editing style of yours 
 john john we do not require is true but we avoid it in cases its useful is lazy it would have been better as you said you didnt learn the lesson for next time and all will be well 
 you are not a newbie 
 im still playing through the game and its ever so interesting the voice chat isnt as determential as the reviews claim it simply requires practice im counting on completeion of the game so i can finish the story section as the plot isnt all its made out to be the aliens arent really aliens have you played the game 
 i havent actually played 
 and thanks for the encouragement there is a need for inovative games such as this and a rather fine line between new content and keeping people happy i think its time more games like this are produced regarding the mm articles i have recently gotten

 i dont know whats worse recovering the kids department at my retail storeor trying to work on making that article encyclopedic i will put it on my queue and mdash 
 lol ^_^ by the way what do you think of ffN ryu and myself make a good team i think we complement each others writing styles extremely well and mdash 
 ah dont forget that you and me worked on ffN as well we all had something to add to any ff article thats currently on fa or fac and mdash

 good answers we have enough i think 
 but i want to be honest i want to tell everything i will try very hard to shut up now i think i see the fascination and why you were so nervous during your second twitch twitch 
 if you really want to fill tony sidaways shoes i can lend you a pair of bloodstained combat boots so long and thanks for all the fish 
 no thanks frankly while i respect tonys energy and dedication i actually disagree with the way he went about some things he was pretty rough on people some times so not only can i not replace him im not sure i want to 
 happy birthday june have a great day 
 another happy birthday from me june have a fantastic day 
 i was checking out the failed fa nomination page for 
 yeah id appreciate it if you brought it up on the main talk page im not really sure where the most ideal and visible place for it would be the problem is that these sources are so few and far between somebody linked a google scholar search for final fantasy iv which brought up five english results only one of which i thought was good material i learned however that the ultimate history of video games actually has some mention of sakaguchi and final fantasy but im pretty sure it isnt more than in passing itd still be worth contacting an owner of the book for that specific text thanks 
 hi there my main concern is in regards to your wanting to use the admin buttons in an area in which you clearly have strong opinions and or or biases about a smaller concern ironically is simply my own personal bias in regards to those who spend considerable time in your subject of interest but im quite sure that i was able to look past that in my participation cheers 
 hi again thanks a lot for the clarification im sure you will make a great admin cheers N N november N 
 vi and viii are now fas thanks for your help ^_^ 
 thanks though thats probably stretching it a bit xd 
 hi there im planning on soloing 
 funny thing is this im actually replaying it after we pushed it to fa status and mdash 
 i have rewritten this page in order to establish notability i would be grateful if you could have a look at it 
 good rewrite but i think it ought to be merged to 
 hello i hope you are feeling great i would like you to view my comments 
 hello thanks for your comments i have fixed all the la liga pages to be in line with the premier league football article titles anyway your comments on this 
 now about your comment on the talk page there in focusing on what editor is of what ethnicity you are commenting on contributors not content and im afraid that might stir up a firestorm again im going to be havery bold and change your comment now thats taking a huge liberty people really should not change others comments so if you at all disagree change it back and i wont do it again but im hoping i can keep your meaning without turning this into an ethnic debate 
 sorry but i could not think of any alternative way of stating the fact that the only people who wanted to move the article were bulgarian (
 there is a very useful trick about the 
 glad to see that we have a threepronged attack here final fantasy ix still needs a lot of work and i dont plan on doing it all in one day like ryu p and mdash 
 i think hes trying to prove something lol seriously i dont know why hes going so crazy and mdash 
 yeah hes getting worse than me and i have been told that im too obsessed d and mdash 
 i was glad to see that this action had been taken after this users vandalism spree however you should know that he has created several other identities and has continued vandalizing 
 thanks for your response and the advice will do 
 you know i have never noticed that the page said player character instead of playable character wow by the way got the series thing fixed in the infobox throw a couple of between the series title and the word series itself 
 i hate that term player character its grammatically incorrect and mdash 
 i personally like the novelty value of it but i do have to admit that decks right about the grammatically incorrect nature of it 
 i find myself growing less fond of old school to me old school involved save the princess after your village burns downtype plots i consider N to be the dawn of the new era of rpgs and mdash 
 fyi i have added some additional questions to your rfa when you have a minute id appreciate if you would take a look thanks 
 done but i fear doc tropic is going to try hunt me down and explain that the word brief 
 i do not think that word means what you think it means but you need to be careful with quotes i once told another editor 
 sounds great we are on our way this article should be a winner 
 once we have fixed the story or plot or character stuff we should be able to contact our ga reviewer for quick ga status and then start building it toward fa 
 i was wondering what that state loaded thing wasas for the french stuff is that a problem that was the only one i could findi will try to find another 
 i rewrote the character section to be like 
 i will look around for that along with N new images to replace the other ones we are doing great 
 does the article need a map and is the french job system a problem just wondering take care 
 ok cool i just noticed several maps on the internet wondered if we needed one and i put the text to the game in the to do box for ya 
 i know you have a ton on your plate right now so if you dont have a few minutes no big deal but could you give me some input on improvements to 
 congratulations on the dyk i made just a few short comments on 
 you are excellent i will leave responses there later today i owe you a few 
 thanks for discussing calmly rather than edit warring hang on a moment i have been asked to weigh in on a different dispute i will take a look here too eventually 
 ok thank you and take your time note jingiby has created more problems with his edits this time removing links to military history articles of germany republic of macedonia and italy so that only bulgaria remains he also stated that macedonian partisans greeted bulgarian troops by their second invasion in vardar macedonia in october N as allies which means a complete waste of the discussion on the talk page also he has linked bulgarian propaganda photos previously deleted from wikipedia to the article as references thanks again 
 i see some discussion has started just keep in mind before letting him mislead you frightner made death threats to bulgarians greeks and albanians 
 please take into account mr neutron that my contributions are allowed as long as they are executed in a civil manner 
 i have just been reading the arbcom election nominations and was wondering what questions i could ask and then i saw your questions great stuff im going to look closely at the candidates replies to your questions i almost wish the arbitrators not running for reelection would answer some of them as well 
 interesting set of questions yes a little bit of overlap with mine but not too much i do wonder whether the sheer overall number of questions is reaching the maximum reasonable limit but i suppose my two questions contribute to that as much as anyone elses i suppose i will have to figure out what my own answers are before i ever run myself someday regards 
 yup they are thoughtful questions keep it up cheers 
 for the 
 thank you i just hate to see a dyk go to waste 
 as long as we arent over reliant on the article we should be fine 
 i dont see why you want to use the gba quotes if you want to change them go right ahead i personally think the snes quotes are fine and since i wrote that section and added all the references you can understand my not wanting to go back and change it 
 nope thats the official 
 nope i dont know of any browsers that it shows up on i was actually removing the doublespacings until i noticed that the entire article has been changed to be like that and i didnt feel like going through to remove all of the double spaces at the moment so i just reverted the ones id removed i might go back and change it later though what do you think 
 its fine no problem i would have commented too if id thought somebody was adding them i really dont see the point in it since it doesnt show up and in my experience that whole double spacing at the end of sentences thing is for teaching kindergartners to make it obvious when they are beginning a new sentence after i add the video game cite template (like zeality just added to 
 hm i must not have noticed when that happened oh well they will be gone before the days over 
 you are now an admin use the shiny new tools for good not evil conservative use is usually better as learning to deescalate a situation is more valuable than inflaming it reread the policies as needed before acting and as you get comfortable help clear out the backlogs have fun and again congrats 
 go you 
 well done 
 thank you all im a bit overwhelmed and will try to start slowly 
 word 
 im not positive but arent you the head of the ffwikiproject i was toying with the idea of starting a wikiproject dragon quest given the deplorable state of the articles is it ok for just anyone to start these projects and do you know how i would go about doing it thanks 
 hibana when you can please see 
 again congratulations on your successful rfa take care ~kylu ( 
 responded in both places though i somehow believe in not quite the way you wanted 
 thank you for your courtesy good luck with the article 
 very sweet note i am touched but why have you not deleted anything yet for a p contributor you seem a little too attached to your administrative virginity 
 not wise to do on your own but once there was a call for a speedy deletion from another user it was pointless to continue the afd keep on 
 remove the tag images of pd art are still pd in order to have rights they need to do something transformative to it in us law a straight photo or scan or whatever is pd if the underlying thing is pd tag it bravely 
 note the mona lisa isnt us either us law requires that us subjects honor even foreign copyrights so i think this makes no difference 
 sorry i responded late but thanks for the great conom note have fun as admin and if you ever need help you know where to find me 
 thanks i went ahead and went through the proper channels i thought it would fit with the delete template i used since it was a redirect to a user page i didnt understand that it was only used for those from the main wikipedia site 
 im glad the whole point was that 
 hi mattisse i submitted an article for dyk today (
 you should check on your nomination frequently and see if there are any problems if there is a problem if the hook is too long or is not referenced in the article etc a reviewer will comment below your nomination so that you can address the complaint and fix it sometimes the reviewer will contact you but not always so it is best to keep checking it until you know a reviewer has accepted it only in extreme cases such as a copyvio would a dyk not ultimately be passed good luck regards and mdash 
 thanks i was confused because there seemed to be a dozen pages associated with the process but that sounds straightforward enough regards 
 actually if you have time id be grateful if you could give the article a readthrough and let me have your feedback mainstream us media ignored the documentary completely while it was highprofile in europe so the available sources are a little skewed and i am concerned the us govt view may be underrepresented for example the only source giving an english version of schwartzs statement was http or or wwwwswsorg uN not a source i wanted to quote uN so i ended up citing 
 that article is not my cup of tea only with great reluctance do i get involved in controversial articles and only under very limited circumstances sorry regards and mdash 
 no prob probably very wise and a good evening to you 
 no i wasnt i just did a what links here before i deleted my qna page 
 its all right its not supposed to be private or anything i just didnt advertise 
 btw do you have a google chat thingie add me as yr friend please use my real email address not crz@gmail 
 sorry i dont chat much 
 hmmm 
 but you will see i did remember to check my email though thats something 
 i would like to thank you for your intervention in the article 
 no thank you i still see some friction on the article but im impressed you can focus on the successes and mostly work things out well done 
 hope you dont mind me mentioning the ani thread i was going to start an ani thread purely to get more eyes on it and then realised there already was a thread so it seemed to make sense to combine everything into one place 
 not at all i was going to post there at first but they smacked the first guy that did so i wasnt sure what to do like you said i believe hes in good faith we just need a review 
 having looked through his talk page i have no realised at least N separate editors have raised concerns about their moves i have raised that point at ani and we will see what happens but at the moment im prepared to discuss things with them and wait to see if they do it again if so i definitely think a new ani thread will be in order 
 now we have more information about the earthquake N dead N injured and some important damage it s notable now so please stop telling me what i have to do how can this earthquake is notable 
 ireland almost never gets earthquakes so that is a bit unique for them i am not telling you what to do only suggesting things that might make you a better editor still two deaths is rather low for an earthquake anyways 
 greetings you must have copied the code from edit space i have adjusted your template test page and you will note now that the and amp#N doesnt show up cheers (
 i have add to the talk on the template page 
 in 
 all right good luck 
 check out what i whipped up at 
 thanks for the addition of the isbn i was going to do that later you think someones just a footnote and they do make for a worthwhile article 
 your statement was you are bad this is not a review it is simply a 
 i will look in when you have areally finished i have been getting edit conflicts so i guess you are still fiddling with it 
 humble apols you know how it is uN the urge to tinker i have really stopped now though i think ssilvers is dipping in 
 i am also finished now happy editing 
 feel free to nominate it for fac whenever you are ready it still needs tweaking but i will take care of some of that when i get the chance and mdash 
 most of that is fairly minor the unsourced statements can be removed if necessary and a copyedit could weed out prose issues as for the script references its up to you and mdash 
 N nd opinion desired 
 delete nothing encyclopedic 
 could i ask you to weigh in on the deletion review for the 
 weighed in and have to tell you it was a close thing i looked at most of the references and they were passing mentions at best if not for uncle gs emphasis of the st louis business article i would have argued to endorse the deletion try to rewrite from a neutral point of view not as an ad 
 please deal with 
 sorry i dont now enough about lebanese people to tell which additions are irrelevant but his edits clearly arent 
 no sorry its not being used to discredit her its an important part of her biography and a notable part of her fame few articles about 
 by the way being an indefinitely blocked user is often considered reason for being blocked again even though i have been given 
 this person 
 you should be aware of this as you have now deleted it twice from your talk page the template is a standard 
 hi mouse i wouldnt have troubled you otherwise but it seems you are aware of the 
 there is no court in the world that would consider posting a persons real name to be defamation 
 we are not a court we are an encyclopedia i would be extremely happy to add a clearly useful and important piece of information to an article but it needs to be 
 i appreciate your most recent remark on my talk page i have never had a problem with a normal process of discussion as you can see i have thousands of edits i have a very serious problem with the blpN template which i will take to the bpl talk page thank you for your tact in not trying to restore it to my page 
 you are welcome good luck if we can convey the same information without giving offense we certainly should 
 hi i was hoping you could make a clarification in the description and or or categories of 
 thank you for the note done 
 can you have another look at the images listed on 
 thanks my firstever barnstar actually its kind of a funny storyid completely forgotten about it when the news broke until a couple weeks after the fact i went into the archives and read the 
 hi you recently paticipated in the fair use discussion of

 thanks 
 nice abuse of the rollback tool for nonvandalism edits i wouldnt count myspace as the official page unless there is no other official page to goto we cant link to everyones N different official pages 
 geez that was stupid of me i was in a bit of a rush and was a little annoyed at people who think that iar is a reasonable keep reason i have finally went and took a look at the mailing list also from yesterday and saw a discussion on 
 thanks thats kind of you 
 aliwiki and kurdo have both made complaints about the proposed changes that i think have merit so im so that iran falling under the influence of the expansionist soviet communist empire refers to the us administration point of view and not a statement of fact the toberevised text and revised text are in italics

 i appreciate it tezero 
 i noticed you removed the mugshot from the page im pretty sure we had reached a compromise leaving a link to the image do we have to have the argument again anonemouse N N november N 
 yes i agreed to a link to it but are you aware that there was not a link there was the actual image of her mugshot with only one other image on the site that of her as a child it doesnt make any sense to me that that one picture should reflect her entire adult existence encompassing her grief over her mothers death her parents divorce her shock and anxiety over N or N which happened in her hometown the day before the incident with the car and cocaine especially since her father and halfbrothers may have lived near the world trade center at that time her career setbacks her breakup with her fiancee etc she paid her dues re the cocaine paraphernalia possession and i dont think that wikipedia should continue to potentially impact negatively on her career in such a brazen way as to have only her mug shot as a reflection of her adult life she has been very open about her previous addiction and her mothers death and her breast cancer advocacy etc many other celebrities refused to discuss their arrest and drug addiction and family members breast cancer diagnosis so i think that she should be given a break so that at the very least only a link to that sad unfortunate picture should be on her wikipedia site 
 oh i remember our compromise to make it only a link but you didnt do that you just removed thats why i wrote to ask if our compromise was still on since it seems to be hopefully my restoring the link is ok 
 i much prefer spending my time editing articles i dont see any admins who would be willing to take on that gang so i dont think its worth the bother i spent several hours putting up evidence at the oarb tribunal so we will see how that goes im guilty of trying to include notable criticisms and controversies in the appropriate sections of the article and for calling for an end to the personal attacks and hostile editing atmosphere on those articles i dont care whether the notable controversies and criticisms are in a section of the article or in some form thats linked so editors can find them but our guidelines and article standards are clear about appropriate inclusion this is the core of the dispute these editors dont want any of the criticisms or controveries included in wikipedia in any way that is readily apparent and by the way i happen to think some of the controversies are ridiculous but when they are notable they should be included and made accessible in a way thats appropriate i dont think this is a radical position and our failure to fix the situation so far is inconsistent with our guidelines this isnt about these frivolous claims against me its about an i dont like it approach to content and an ends justifies the means approach to obstructing and disrupting my efforts to improve the encyclopedia and i havent even gotten to the core of the fixes needed one of their recent ani reports was against my trying to include that 
 you see heres the trouble consider an admin who doesnt really know the details of the case when they look into it its not remotely clear who is the good editor and who is harassing whom it might seem very clear to you in the thick of it but from someone elses perspective you are the troll once both sides have called each other troll we might as well give up on writing and just go roll around in the mud together splish splash no admin will take on that gang as long as you and they seem equally tendentious and equally disruptive how can i tell that you are right and they are wrong if you step back and take a long view of the situation you will realize that it looks quite symmetric from the outside i certainly cant tell that they are a gang and you are an innocent i see mud flying in all directions and i associate good editors with a lack of mud i do hope that you will consider my offer to mediate disputes with these people at the content level if you trust me enough to do that then your complaints at the behavior level will take care of themselves if you really cant find an admin to take on that gang there might be a good reason for that admins who play policeman tend to be terrible admins and we tend to get rid of them wikipedia has no cops and the best way to handle personal disputes is at the content level then you have got both feet planted firmly in the encyclopedia and thats where your power flows from this is just what i have noticed some people dont believe this 
 but i think you are missing the point that the whole purpose of the mudslinging is to muddy the water so nobody can see clearly theres nothing i can do to stop these absurd ani reports one after the other thats the beauty of their strategy its making it difficult to deal with the content and your turn the other cheek approach is nice and all but if you let enough people go around saying enough bad things about you without responding your reputation isnt going to be very good for long id love to focus on the content how do i do that thats all i do when im not engaged in these ridiculous attacks on my character 
 pick an article to start with and point me to it we will work on it together im not much longer for this evening but i will be around over the weekend and i seldom get very far away 
 gtbacchus i do respect that you are trying to work with childofmidnight that empathy is sometimes helpful and that some administrators see their role as being mediators however please keep in mind that by saying there is something symmetric about this or that there is a gang that is equally anything is implicitly endorsing an accusation one that i consider grossly undeserved an unfair at a content level every editor is free to propose what they wish but at some point consensus is consensus a single editor with a different viewpoint does not a real dispute make 
 as far as the gang language i will adress people in the language that i think will get the point to them most easily and quickly i do not consider you to be part of a gang but sometimes i have to speak different languages to different people i hope thats understandable 
 as for the single editor with the single viewpoint please take me to your content dispute since you are right show me show me the money 
 well you havent made it clear that you are any less of a mudslinger from what i have seen since you are confident that you are right you should welcome my offering to take a look at the articles and get to the bottom of this 
 also dont assume that anyone in particular has my support or empathy i view every single one of you as infinitely valuable expressions of the divine and i also view every single one of you with extreme caution if you try and guess what im up to you have got a very high probability of being wrong i surprise people 
 thats really sweet well the issue is that as far as i can tell childofmidnights main concern is the obama articles a matter squarely in arbcom perhaps the barney frank one that has me perplexed and i may even agree with com on the content there wasnt there some issue at drudge report too both of those are very bitesized content issues 
 so you mean 
 news about barney frank is not allowed in the state of texas children might see it 
 i may have been born in texas and i may live here now but i moved from seattle the gayest city in america i think it might have passed san francisco the year they couldnt decide whether to hold the pride parade in the traditional gay district or downtown so they did both before that i lived in portland where you are not considered very cool if you arent a lesbian good ol west coast 
 thanks for clearing that up truth to tell if i hadnt caught him on 
 actually is this an active dispute wikidemon i dont see com editing the article or talk page for over a week if theres not an active dispute except for the one in arbcom then what is all this about im looking at the history of 
 in all seriousness though as far as i know the locus of the dispute really is barack obama articles (im not sure wikidemon was even involved in whatever happened at 
 oh i thought you were proposing to do a post mortem on the content issues raised during one of these disputes i have no active content dispute with childofmidnight and so far as i know com is not currently edit warring anything the issue is entirely behavioral i have a big problem with the premise though when you say that i havent made it clear that i am any less of a mudslinger i dont have to why should i as far as i know my body of work here has never been under any legitimate challenge one cannot disprove a negative there is nothing particular i want contentwise nor do i have any desire for childofmidnight or anyone else to get sanctioned or go away as long as the personal attacks edit warring etc cease i am more than content i thought about that and under the circumstances if you want to broker anything a behavioral truce would be most welcome i would go further if we could get all the parties to the obama arbitration to stipulate by agreement that they do not ask the arbitration committee for sanctions against any editor but rather guidance on how editing talk and article patrol will work on the obama pages that they personally pledge to honor whatever arbcom finally decides in that regard while awaiting arbcoms ruling they will stick to N rr no complaints about other editors on talk pages and edit summaries etc and we have an expedited simple system for making sure people honor their promises then the arbcom case would likely sail through much more efficiently and we might be able to get from here to there without any further blowups 
 incidentally i watched the barney frank thing going on but took no part in it and had no particular content position in some ways i was more convinced by childofmidnights further even where i do have a content position i have largely confined myself to N rr for any given point whether on the obama articles or most anywhere except in clear cases of vandalism and the like so you will not find me edit warring or doing anything else just laying out my position on the talk page like a good editor what shocked me at barney frank were the sudden accusations of homophobia and bad faith editing 
 since we both got sidetracked a bit you had asked for commentary on 
 thanks thats basically what the other reviewers wrote i will add it to the review however i have noticed that its a lot harder for me to actually put the reviewer comments into practice than it was for you with babb i would write something and you would do it while with jameson its taking many days for me to make better paragraphs out of the broken points 
 would you like me to nominate you to be an admin 
 heh no not yet the most important job in an encyclopedia is adding content i have done none of that yet and in my own standards of myself i shouldnt be an admin till i have done that at least for a good while i think i will start adding to math articles come winter break when i have time off from college and have time to do things other than vandalfight though it does seem to be the season though so many are being sysoped lately as for nomming me 
 on a side note how do i tell its a school ip 
 makes sense click the whois button at the bottom of the ips talk page it comes up as one of two things but edit history includes the school and makes it obviously a school ip you try not to block schools for too long certain N is more than necessary imo i block schools for half an hour thats usually enough to have them leave the lab go to class and allow the rest of the school to edit 
 my rationale for N was that vandalism has been once a day for the last N days so N might not have any effect a half hour certainly wouldnt have any effect there had been a N hour block a few months ago if its a school and its friday the distinction between N and N may be moot of course 
 thank you and good luck in your efforts 
 hi anonemouse i have 
 thats 
 considering you have more support than any other candidate as well as a history of support from 
 also if that lonely opposition can get you to pay a bit more attention to transparency in decisions when you are elected it will have been more than worth while 
 see the first draft of userfreakofnurtures responses to one of my arbcandidate questions to him and the associated comment on his talkpage for further relevant discussion of traps 
 im sorry i need a couple of links i looked through a couple of histories and have no idea what you must be talking about i think im more dim than usual today 
 see and 
 hi i am pleased to let you know that on december N rd the voting for the new members of the arbitration committee will begin any user who had at least N mainspace edits as of november N N is qualified to vote (
 and yes you are qualified to vote and to run 
 okay any time your ready 
 i tried to make those responses a tad more clear for people reading though i didnt change too much 
 if you can rewrite so i can understand what you mean i wont change to support but i will even withdraw the opposition im big on intelligent understandable arbcom statements you have achieved the intelligent part probably now if only i understood what you were writing 
 ok i added a bottom line comment to most of the answers that state my conclusions 
 voters are requested not to add extensive comments to their votes an uninvolved party may move long comments to the talk page uN 
 you have a point i moved the uninvitedcompany comment to the talk page i assume this is the one you meant

 id actually like to second that request if you have time to review the comments and perhaps some of the editors contribs i think you could provide some useful insight 
 looks like it closed before i got there the article 
 given the number of times i have come to you with blp issues since you made admin i must be your #N pest i hope you are not getting blisters from wielding the mop 
 wow worse than geogre i thought i knew your problems with geogre related to turning up the heat in the giano case but what has paul august done he seems quite innocuous dedicated and noncontroversial 
 he said geogre was better than him i think he is a bit of an 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or in honor of your ideas patience and concern for the project 
 not prompted by anything in particular over the last several weeks i have been very impressed with your demeanor and attitude your discussion style and your ideas keep up the good work 
 i didnt remove the discussion i just posted it twice by mistake and removed the dupe 
 i have commentated on the article talk page 
 got another one for you 
 i put the text from several deleted revisions in 
 oh and more general advice dont take it so hard its not the end of the world that wikipedia sits a few weeks or months without this information really it will all turn out for the best in the end eventually someone will find or write a better source for this information and we will be able to write a good enough article with sufficient content and references meanwhile even if a few people did come looking for a recipe for the incredible hulk and had to find it elsewhere or even make martinis or screwdrivers instead i dont think they suffered long 
 hi thanks for your work on this article its good to know someone out there knows what to do with horse articles i just wikilinked the damn thing 
 welcome to the wild and wacky world of the horse breeds articles by the way you are doing a nice job thanks for your help watch out for copyright issues with some of these breeds that have very few sources can be a challenge to create content sometimes by the way there is a need for additional articles to be created on the assorted breeds of horse or pony native to japanwe have three or four done but there are N or N breeds see 
 thank you for the redirect on postier bretonuN e the dear little eager beaver who created it seems to log in about once every few months creating a ton of stubs and red links in her wake this time she didnt confine herself to breed articles she also did some veterinary medicine stubs that i cant decide if they need to be put up for speedy deletion or if we should try to salvage them i didnt have the time to research this one so thanks for doing it by the way did you also enroll at 
 put them all together and you just might squeak by i will lean on crz a bit not to speedy it while you are working for a few days but if by chance it gets deleted again dont panic even so see above 
 well i didnt recreate it someone else did i simply took the things you found along with some additional searching and i expanded it some more my comments on the talk page sum up my thoughts on the whole matter pretty clearly thanks again for your help the only thing i would like to see done eventually is to name it as incredible hulk instead of 
 thanks again for all your great help 
 added both deleted revisions 
 also added a couple of references to 
 all of the above being a mission that you may choose to accept or say no thanks or just do something else if you need help doing anything just give me a holler over on my talk page 
 thanks 
 thank you for your clarification on 
 whoo deep waters yes from reading the article it seems the main backing for the controversy is a single book by ankerberg and weldon i will opine in the afd 
 err on the other hand the 
 thanks for the imput it is good to know that i was not losing my mind and that my initial interpretation of fringe was sound i can accept your take on things disappointing but so be it i think both sides in this debate have let their personal povs about masonry influence their arguments on the afd and in editing the article and it is nice to have a reality check from an outsider 
 i guess our help is not needed this place is not getting less strange 
 there have been numerous accusations so perhaps she felt it is better to ignore that dribble and not feed it by covering it up with a revert i hadnt noticed at first when i removed it that she had previously restored it 
 normally i would be glad but here no because it was deleted via afd 
 the afd like most of them was based on the state of the article at the time which had no references also it was nominated by a certain legend but its not important the article isnt ready for recreation yet and may never be we will argue it out should it come to that thanks for stating your view 
 he is a legend he was my first love i fthe article is substantially different from the one afdd we can recreate under gN i think its fine i will be flexible 
 as for the N articles on minor horsesgo ahead and tag them for notability if you want and if you think they are really irrelevant ask for speedy deletion incidentally if they were all started by usermerrymount shes been a little overenthusiastic all around if you check her talk page you will see that i have been leaving messages there for months she never replies and may be learning a little but needs to have some appropriate consequences her new breed articles are sometimes useful but i have been spending way too much time in the last two weeks cleaning up all the messes she makes im quite frustrated with her and as far as i am concerned let the natural consequences occur 
 go look at my talk page we have landed us a my horse is purer than god himself fanatic grrr gee thanks may need backup if you know any friendly admins have them watchlist the article usually these sorts go away in a few days but can get interesting for a while 
 or 
 this is a funny coincidence id like to direct your attention to whether you agree or not the nominator raises an interesting point about notability re things that have gotten media coverage when i read this article after seeing it on dyk i immediately thought pretty much all the things the nominator says in the afd of this rachel hudson article but i just let it go but now that i see this blossoming debate i wonder if you think the situation applies doubly so to this article after all nobody died at the heart attack grill and it got far far less media coverage than rachel hudson in other words i would consider nominating this article for deletion based on the reasoning used in the above cited debate but i thought i would get your feedback thoughts 
 # finally lets see i wrote the article over several days found a good number of sources edited reedited nominated it for dyk edited the dyk nomination repeatedly and apparently care about this sort of thing given that i plaster dyk banners all over my user page hmm is it really that much of a mystery how i would feel if that article were casually deleted for not being important 
 ok ok i get it i get it sorry i asked 
 i see you are having a problem with 
 im about to start on the ff talk page with the megeney situation lets see what happens first 
 hi anonemouse you seem to be a major editor in the subject and to know wikipedias policies in the area much better than i do so i wonder if you have the time and interest if you could look in on a work in progress of mine 
 this seems like an excellent thing to discuss on 
 many thanks for the thoughtful and useful comments anonemouse i will reply there as soon as i get the chance 
 if you see holes in my logic please let me know so i can mend the errors of my ways on the other hand if i appear to be in the right please advise me on what steps i should try next sorry this is so long but it is the first one of these so i was probably overly explanatory thanks 
 most of all thank you for finally engaging in dialog with me i really appreciate it ps sorry for filling up your talk space with all this anonemouse it really belongs on the articles 
 guys congratulations on finishing 
 thank you for including the piece on the tb families i felt that it was important to include at least some of this as the N founding stallions were not alone in producing this great breed there too is often confusion in reading catalogues and stud books that needs clarifying 
 the smile was perfect those things actually do work 
 dont suppose youd care to wade into the fray have you background with hackamores care to play 
 okay i have sucessfully kicked my isp into finally fixing my issues where do we stand on this article what needs doing most it will be tomorrow before i get to anything serious but might as well start thinking about what we need 
 i will try to look at it after dinner im starving 
 well we have a review nothing too terrible but some rewriting with the controversy section i took care of some of the stuff i will let you fiddle with the others but if you cant i will try to take care of it when i get home monday night 
 somehow two images in the 
 thats not really discussion of the books thats two list entries there is nothing that indicates the books were in any way special to the article it bears a list of a dozen of them the intention of the tags are for articles primarily or to a large part about the books themselves to cite one example we both know the 
 any road thanks for your assistance just in case i wind up not nagging you again before then i hope you thoroughly enjoy your holidays have good days and mdash 
 please revert yourself so that cquote redirects to bquote it cannot be used in articles until it has been fixed the template uses the click template and a table in place of a blockquote which is unacceptable please discuss changes in the future instead of revert warring uN 
 thank you for your response i took the liberty of copying it to 
 there is a different argument to be made for merging some of these obscure breed stubs for convenience sake but i guess i err on the side of being careful to declare a breed extinct just my humble opinion 
 thanks for your reply would not be impossible that i put on merge tags in fact quite likely international museum of the horse lists none of them including indian country bred so no help there i think the liveforhorses site is acceptable given that there just is not much available on these obscure breeds and we will probably never be putting them up for ga it is a source and absent anything better it actually appears to have decent content add that and okie state and you will have better sources then hendricks imho i guess i fully agree that bhutia and spiti work well merged but maybe we should go ahead and restore tibetan pony as an article for now but maybe add some good see also links to indian country bred and maybe a mention that there is a lot of crossbreeding going on as for hardy little crossbreds yeah i sort of agree though being an ayrab aficionado myself i kind of think everything since the four foundations is technically a crossbred so where the line gets drawn i dont knowbut i figure if there has been a more or less consistent breeding population that can go back N years or so i will take it or put differently i draw the line somewhere between the warlander and oh maybe the 
 yes that works for me none of these more obscure breed articles will be ga any time soon so i am not terribly worried if they arent perfect you are doing such great work on the overall breed articles cleanup right at a time when my own gumption is a bit burned out and i just appreciate all you do 
 hello i was wondering if you think it is a good idea to propose 
 replied on your talk page 
 thanks for your opinion i can lend a hand with the lead and especially with the 
 indeed leptictidium the horse article is nowhere ready for even ga let alone fa horrors the evolution section may need some help but it is only to be a summary that directs readers to 
 hi again anonemouse im still learning how wikipedia works so im not sure if some things that i personally think are not quite right are the way wikipedia works normally and i should just get used to them anyway i have some concerns about some recent actions here an editor acquaintance of mine (
 the first seems overreaction i will ask jzg if we can unblock the second is correct though it would have to be rather extreme to cause actual banning you want to see 
 uffN euN d 
 uffN euN d 
 took a hard look at it and i cant see anything missing very well done 
 i do have one question concerning this article did you actually read her autobiography im reading it right now and although i have only reached page N i already noticed several contradictions to what is written in the article also some interesting facts from the book seem to be missing in the article eg that she initially wanted to become a showgirl like her mother and actually achieved this and that the name she used as a stripper was jennasis regards 
 i have the autobiography as well and i havent reread it since i bought it with an eye to seeing what can be lifted from it for use within the article since you are going through it why not make a list of the items you think should be included put that list on this talk page and we all can hash out what should and should not be folded in 
 ok but i cant make any promises about how fast i will be i will try to list the contradictions and possible additions so far tomorrow regards 
 my answers in italics great work by the way 
 the problem is that both sections have huge weaknesses i think you are right but maybe just let me do the merge because i have already done lot of cleanup in rodeoif i sit on it for another week nag me will that work 
 if independent sources list ob and yakut separate i see no pressing need to merge those two wonder if there is more on north russian pony group intriguing if we can find a source including the narym that would be a good title for a merged article but i guess in absence of a pressing crisis we can just let the merge tags sit until we find more data 
 you will be sorely missed all the best 
 i will second that 
 absolutelyty take a break but your input is crucial to this project and we greatly appreciate your help and your hard work here 
 wholehearted agreement the arts are a vital subject here which dont get as much attention as they should your contributions in that field are something we would extremely important to all of us particularly to the dweebs like me whose own knowledge and understanding of the subject is well lets just say unimpressive everyone is more than entitled to a break once in a while and you have certainly earned one but i sincerely hope to see you active again at your earliest convenience 
 i moved things around can you take a quick gander and let me know what you think hopefully i will be able to work on those fact tags tonight 
 im going to work on a gan real quick then do the sources check on 
 just an fyi that thoroughbred went up to fac today with you as a conominator 
 heh no caffeine yet thanks for catching the misspelling on vts name 
 hello again i saw the ga on jj good stuff i will be looking for it at fac soon i hope i was wondering if when time permits of course you could take a look at 
 i gather someone gad it already anyway i added just a few comments to the review per request 
 you are a man among mice or something thanks again for your help or patience with my work 
 i see you have nominated this article for deletion with the comment an unorganized compilation of uncited theory myth and random facts that can already be found in better more organized articles isnt there one of these articles that this could be redirected to as an alternative to deletion i usually get my daughter to help with horsey subjects but shes annoyed with me at the moment because i didnt have her dinner ready when she got home from work today 
 im hijacking danas page phil the long story short is that there is no such breed it cant really be merged because its such a mess there are articles on other horses that are mentioned in this one but we cant redirect one article three different places it needs to just quietly go away 
 basically ditto what montana said this isnt actually a breed the article is basically just saying that horses were domesticated a long time ago in the area that is now iran however if you have any suggestions on where it could be merged to than please feel free to share them 
 i have being working on the article 
 cheers for trying anyway 
 i suppose so im doubtful of the relevance of any fanclub link in an encyclop and aeligdia to be honest i assume that especially if its official therell be a link on one of the other sites linked to 
 ah its not a fansite but a site for fans i suppose that that makes a difference

 thank you it was apparently removed by a vandal i have restored it 
 hi there dana boomer i hope you are doing well i think the most cogent comment so far at 
 i dont beleive either of the primary authors have a problem with delisting the page 
 just a warning that i have a huge pile of journal articles i just pulled that may have sourcing or etc for the article hoping to get to work on them later this week some for 
 hello dana i am seriously disappointed that you would go and change all the 
 i know the cite template is not a must and i wont hit you over the head about using it and if you feel that it breaks the flow in the edit window we can use the wrapping version of the template but i am seriously concerned that you remove information which is unobstrusive to the point and is presented in a format to improve wikipediawide consistency 
 the information is still there in the article its just that the bibliographical information like publisher location etc is now located in the bibliography section there is no required wikipediawide format there are several systems in use and the general idea is to conform to the system already in use in the article horses in warfare is a ga and the equine wikiproject is pointing it towards fac so we need to keep the references consistent with the format already in use 
 well i missed the fact that that information had been kept at another location personally id much rather have it together in one main list of references but at least it is mostly retained so i will shut up cheers 
 thank you for replying ealdgyth since i was offline for a while ingolfson what i did was simply to follow the format that was in play for the rest of the article as ealdgyth said the information is still in the article it has simply been moved down to the section called references that way we can use the short form for the intext cites and in so doing make the notes section shorter and easier to read since there is no longer information repeated when the same book is used multiple times i hope my reply answer your question and ease your frustration 
 makes sense now thanks carry on i think i saw your will to live somewhere could it have rolled under the couch 
 its ok and mdash i think that i left it in my other jacket 
 hi dana thanks for your note id be happy to give the article another review and comment on it again but as for closing the review im afraid that is out of my hands because i listed it as a community review to generate wider comment the gar cannot be closed until consensus has formed and then only by certain editors if the article has improved enough then that is just a formailty but i cant perform it 
 hi thanks for the note i certainly will be giving a rereview of the article on the gar and from what i have seen of the changes to the article it will almost certainly recommend that the review is closed and the article kept unfortunately as noted at the top of my talk page i am extremely busy at the moment and simply havent had time to perform a proper review i object very strongly to montanabws hectoring tone and attitude it is not my fault this article needed work and i really dont appreciate being accused of discoutesy and of making other editors do unneccessary work objections i laid out on montanas talk page and feel were perfectly justified it has always been my intention to rereview the article and frankly unpleasant comments on my talk page such as those left by montana do not encourage me to make this a top priority hopefully i will get to this over the next couple of days regards 
 my reply elsewhere 
 thank you for the kind note i am glad you found my remarks useful i never found it easy to write articles which is probaly why i migrated over to wikisource however i am always happy to find areas where i can be helpful and that are more suited to me than article writing 
 i have been really taking advantage of the nice weather rather than following anything online very closely good luck with it and let me know if you have any questions about my review 
 thats fine that you reverted it cool with me but i do think once the divorce is final it should read as exhusband because it technically is her exhusband i know the picture is taken when they were husband and wife but it is still mislabeled as that is now changed whenever i see photos of somethingsay wellanything but maybe an expolitical leader and its an old photo the caption would read something like president bush with former president blank or something like that its just how i have always seen this sort of thing done so i dont understand why it wouldnt be done in here 
 well we can write thenhusband or something i guess but its clumsy heres a 
 it appears that the archives have been vandalized the information that i had put there documenting that jamesdN had linked the article to his booksellers website has been removed it now starts with sethies reply to my information the links he added and later removed after my protest can be seen at 
 folks and by this i mean both kwork and renee and whoever else please dont make this personal this should be about 
 thanks uN 
 no problem 
 i have made the corrections you suggested if theres anything else i need to do dont hesitate to ask i appreciate the time you have taken to review the article and would like to say thanks for doing that 
 sorry about that id thought i addressed everything i have added a citation to that spot and added another in the nenana section thanks again 
 yes that looks very clean you do nice work 
 thanks for your review of the article please see my comment 
 thanks again i have replied 
 further to your ga review comments on

 eek i quickfailed the articles gac nom just as you signed on to review it if you think the fail was incorrect and or or premature please feel free to revert me otherwise well i suppose we can remove it from 
 awesome thanks for the extra insight the nom seemed to come from a random driveby editor and after a few bad experiences i guess i have become somewhat weary of longwinded reviews for articles with no major contributor in sight hopefully your spoton suggestions will help someone who has a thing for dentistry 
 first please use them for all your edits second please read my edit summaries for

 i like it and sorry i have been so out of it everyone i really am up to my ears in real life im trying to stay in touch maybe email me if theres a crisis 
 thanks for your helpful and specific remarks on the ga review i have been attempting to take action on them as i will be away from the wikipedia for a couple of days there will be a hiatus however i will carry on when i get back i have left comments on the need for publishers in refs on the ga review page and i have a general question about short and long references namely do you suggest that each short ref should link to a full ref as is currently the case for boyle and lyall if not then anyone wanting to check out a ref my find it difficult as surname alone is not that precise 
 replying on the review page 
 thanks for you time 
 the clear violation is where mobile commented on woohookittys talk page as an anon referred to himself in the third person and then signed as mobile N however mobile did go back and correct that prior to anyone telling him to so perhaps give him some credit for that the other anon edits do not appear to be disruptive and it is plausible that mobile failed to log in during those edits 
 as i tried to explain earlier the message to 
 thanks for your time sorry to drag you into this case 
 i am truly sorry that he has chosen to spill this over to your page as well as everywhere else i go see discussion page 
 aieeee i understand why travb chose me because i have been the most active admin closing sock puppet cases on that terribly backlogged page also because as part of that effort i edited the case page to make the section headings conform to the bigger page i can also understand your strong feelings over this one still please folks try hard to be concise i know its an effort there is already plenty to read on the page in that case here can i offer that the most concise person wins no i guess not i have been trying to do the most backlogged ones first but ok you have convinced me i will take a look at this erupting volcano even out of turn but it will take me a while just because of the sheer volume of stuff i have to read and investigate unless you can be extremely concise brief terse even hold your fire please otherwise it will be like 
 case closed the only way it could have been really whew 
 hi dana 
 thank you for the hint about referencing the end of paragraph i learned something this is not something i would systematically do do you see anything else cheers 
 hi dana thank you for your message i am not a native english speaker so clearly i will need your help for prose and flow i will do my best for the intro and the ref naming cheers 
 copyedit from my talk page though your note mentions safety hamiltonpaterson stresses that the sbac request was not on safety grounds but and i think hes quoting the sbac because it was inappropriate behaviour for a bomber he cites the aeroplane jan N pN 
 i see your reading of it though its not N per cent for me what do you make of empire of the clouds captures the period but a bit melancholy in places and reminds me leaving roly for a mo why dont we have an article on 
 i think one of the most melancholic aspects of the book is actually the human side hp shows how the test pilots were as famous as footballers in their time yet now they are largely forgotten and many of them died in the course of the work now i look at empire of the clouds again bill is in it quite a lot and using the outline of his career taken from empire would probably give a start article but i think first thing i will do is drop in a stub as a placeholder i know you have strong views on citation style so i wont be surprised or bothered if you change them around 
 blackmans vulcan test pilot is probably the best read on the roly roll et al 
 well i suppose the author is writing from a personal opinion and i guess waterton as an archcritic of british aviation fits for putting forward the premise that postwar british aviation was really a bit rubbish so far i have been mining it for the hard facts more than character analysis which id rather leave to others has any of the hagiography manifested itself in the article yet 
 i believe that i fixed everything 
 i believe that now everything is fixedthanks for reviewing the article 
 can be found 
 one last reply thanks 
 when i add stuff like to your reviews right if you do i will stop or 
 oki just wanted to make sure that you didnt think that i was undercutting you or anything im just interested in military related things so i always take a look at the war and military articles when i see one pass or fail on my watchlistso anyway thanks 
 thanks so much for taking time to read and critique the 
 i have done quite a bit of work on the 
 hiim not sure what the problem is it is a gfdl image and was uploaded on wikimedia commons the original uploader and photographer gave me permission to use it check out the discussion page on the main images page 
 i am also forwarding your message to the original uploader 
 last message sorry the commons page states that any of these conditions can be waived if you get permission from the copyright holder i got permission from the owner of the image to use it on wikipedia with her complete permission 
 you are quite right will restore image my apologies 
 dont worry about itsorry for the confusion 
 thank you for the review i am currently deciding whether or not to leave the project due to severe bullying from another editor if i stay i will implement your suggestions 
 i have been busy and would appreciate you leaving the article on hold rather than failed thank you i will be able to handle it sometime in the next couple of days and it would be silly to go through the whole ga process again 
 well kindathe other three are my noms or 
 no prob reviewing is fun and the lengths are not my faultthatd be the creators 
 and stop passing bellhallas ga noms hes going to win the bloody 
 lol i wasnt actually annoyed that guy likes his wwiera cargo ships 
 by the way when you are done with the ga review will you notify the creator 
 so i probably should have looked over triton a wee but more before i nominated it eh sorryanyway dont worry too much operation strikeback is a lot better 
 would you take a look at it again he removed all of the message board postings 
 no problemmdashi saw that you were going to be gone whenever you get to it 
 anonemouse im honored that you would think of it but right now i have to declinetoo much going on in rl to devote the time or energy to an rfa honestly im not sure i would pass right nowid like to have more substantial mainspace edits for one thing also if you go back a little farther in my edit history i have been involved in some contentious situations and while i dont think my behavior has been awful i havent been as levelheaded as i should have been (im thinking particularly of stuff in the september and october N archives of 
 maybe its redundant to say so but thanks for the thanks on wpan i see that your message there enlisted some additional help at ssp which is great 
 please see 
 the edits signed as youneedasmackbot are by

 vp was blocked for being a sock puppet of

 you are right i misread the month jan N rather than feb N still after the blocks but not today 
 this sounds like one of those legal arguments where some technical point is the reason to find the accused innocent i have no clue if he is a sockpuppet of kdbuffalo or not because that never was my accusation i would assume you could check ip addresses but im wondering if that assumption is incorrect he was blocked for deleting talk pages en masse he got around that block blatantly and without remorse by creating what i called sockpuppets he didnt even bother to pretend i believe that is the reason he deserves a permanent blockhe willfully violated wikipedia rules in fact and in law you are right there will continue to be editors who use the 
 according to 
 it was his sockpuppet 
 not sure what you mean by honorable i dont think i wrote that i do believe he wasnt a blatant vandal and did make some effort to be constructive i looked through 
 i didnt say you used the word honorable i used it to mean that he can be trusted whether the deletions were warranted he had no right to delete them but we really digress he tried to evade and in fact did evade bans not once but several times and he kind of laughed about it why should a permanent ban be turned into a shortterm ban based on his total disregard of wikipedia culture 
 try 
 yeeeeaaaaah no well maybe but not now d thats just plain scary to undertake anyway i will get to the triton asap after dinner methinkswe will see im stuck back in my 
 i have removed the dated prod template from 
 your opinion is welcome at 
 hi dana discussion ensuing over emphasis and sources on 
 yup i have been following the discussion and as you said all seems cordial at the moment i will step in if i see a need 
 or if you can say it better than i did 
 my experiences with vacuous poet were overwhelmingly negative he seemed to view wp as an arena to engage in baiting and fights if he is allowed back in it would have to be with the strictest understanding that any return to his previous disruptive behaviors would have serious negative consequences i think that even if banned users can find new ips to come in on we inconvenience them by making them use different ips and they are less active and eventually give up 
 absolutely with the strictest understanding yes from reading the talk page of 
 not to say i told you so but you should read the following 
 thanks for the ga review> have addressed your concerns 
 thanks for the ga promotion 
 im going to start working to help clear the backlog here but im pretty new to it figuring that you are much more familiar with it if you happen to see that i have some something really stupid please let me know thanks for all your work there too 
 thank you very much take a look a bit higher on this talk page for when ftN asked for advice most of what i wrote there should still be good 
 i have looked at your recent work and it seems fine thank you again 
 thats really comprehensive advice thank you it reaffirmed things i had learned and you also had some good tricks in there glad to hear that what i have done looks okay thanks for taking a look at it once i got into it it seemed natural what to explore and dig into kind of fun also nice work combing through and closing 
 hi dana i saw the review you did for princeofcanada im new to the ga area but i was impressed by the step by step way you reviewed his article for this reason i have come to beg you also my article is 
 yes i will take over the reviewalthough i may not get to a full review until later today 
 hi there in light of your comments on the fpc talkpage i think that you and i have some similar ideas regarding a different level of recognition outside the featured picture mechanism you mentioned that you already had put some thought into something along those lines if you are looking for a sounding board or second opinion before putting it all out there on the fpc talkpage please consider me available if you like based on the other comments in the thread i think theres a real desire to get something else out there though obviously there are some pitfalls wed all like to avoid if you dont have room on your plate for that kind of thing right now i will probably throw something out there on the fpc talkpage and see what the community feeling is cheers 
 proposal added to fpc talk 
 hey john hope you are doing well about the vi are you going ahead with your plan 
 sorry for the delay option N certainly got the most votes i dont know what to do about no one opposing but i think you should go ahead and set up the pages regarding using the ppr page perhaps it would be better to set up an entirely new place with the voting system much like the current fpc one except the criteria to be different 
 i just dropped by to see if you were up for getting the wheels moving on this id say you got a pretty clear consensus for option N although reading over the debate which brought us to that point there are very few expressed preferences as to exactly what and where it should be my N xaN uN it seems to me there was no objection to ppr being adapted for the purpose and id suggest starting a discussion to thrash out the criteria first and foremost id suggest the biggest initial moves would be discussing a redirect from wpppr to wpvp keeping it simple for now no need for special reviewer qualifications no need for complex submission categories ie you go to ppr or vp and a candidate image either gets vp promoted fp submitted or simply reviewed without award looking at comvi criteria and slimming them down to major points to give the wp project something to build onthe first thing would be to port this discussion to wpppr talk get a consensus for the main changes and see what happens 
 i dont have any problem with ppr but i was wondering what if someone wants both vote for vi and peer review for fpc lets say it passes for both what will we do add it to vi or nominate at fpc these and some other such situations made me a bit reluctant to using ppr but if ppr is simpler then lets go for it 
 well then if thats figured out everything is ok with me when do we start 
 ok sorry if i sounded impatient best of luck 
 wow you sure do work fast i have left my comments on the ppr discussion page great work done btw 
 hi jjron the ppr talk page has been quite for some time and not much going on apart from the comments made by mikaul slaunger and me we have only about six days to go and i noticed that commons is very active announcing the launching recruiting reviewers etc do we need to do ay such ting do you need any help regards 
 commons discussion are on the vi talk page i read your comments on the ppr discussion page and i guess you are right no need to rush things more on the ppr discussion page 
 saw you put it up for feature article its way early but the feedback so far is promising meanwhile i picked up 
 i remember i remember i will help even more when when the jenna fac is over im just slow im not exaggerating that the jenna jameson work took me N months but i will help 
 congrats i expected that to be a lot more painful for a longer time than it was given some of the commentary thats excellent 
 congratulations as well only five days and mdashthat was quick i expected it to take much longer over here it would have taken N days (standard time for 
 maybe a quarter of the drama took place on an and ani its linked to all over the place from 
 thanks for your review i will probably have your recommendations substantially implemented tomorrow only feedback i have is re the proquest or ebscohost references those will be live links for anyone who does have a password so would it be acceptable to include a note to the reference in lieu of deleting the urls thanks 
 replied on the review page 
 thanks for review i am working on it 
 i have addressed your comments 
 cite templates added removed disputed sentence could not remember the ref added ref for the rest 
 anything else needed 
 thanks i really appreciate your efforts of considerably improving articles who review thanks again 
 many thanks for taking time out to look at this anonemouse and thanks for the compliment you have given me lots of good suggestions to work on some of which will take a little while to put in place some i might quibble with as you know the article started as a list and i do see that some listy aspects remain i will work on taking them out of the text still i do like the yearly debut lists after the yearly summaries since it highlights the name outside of a paragraph of text but if others raise objections those can go the textless years naturally are the ones i havent been able to find text on yet this will eventually be remedied anyway thanks for the support 
 hi which admins are currently doing a lot of work on 
 not me that much unless it involves a porn star then i will take it the 
 completed the stub 
 thanks but dont forget wpdate the deathdate in the opening and the various kings and kings 
 i cant figure out why the whole link is not able to be included within ref N this is why it appears dead in N good article attempts and N reviews i havent run across this problem you have any ideas 
 replied on review page 
 ok i followed your suggestions for the most part the exceptions were the addition of publisher info and converting to cite web from what i understand cite web is required for fa not ga if publisher info is a must i will try not all the refs have an obvious publisher since a few are just off the web not through a refereed journal 
 can you take a look at the fair use argument on a picture im trying to keep a headshot of some of the dead playmates around and they are being challenged the key one right now would be 
 want me to copy this somewhere 
 if you would please 
 you reviewed the article on 
 replied on the review page 
 hello dana boomer i noticed that you occasionally revert vandalism would you like me to grant your account 
 rollback granted dont worry about how much you use it the main thing is that rollback is used correctly using rollback to revert goodfaith edits or to revertwar with other users can lead to its removal while no or little use but correct use of the tool is fine for practice you may wish to see 
 you are welcome 
 could you kindly stick to the issue at hand in the fac which is to discuss the article not me 
 heavens i didnt think you would object to being called a good editor but ok will strike 
 im a bit ambiguous as to why you changed the name predator was to define between a predator as a species and the film itself the article on the alien was changed because alien sounded bad i believe to differentiate between the numerous alien articles but the article on the predators themselves didnt need to be clarified in my opinion this also means fixing links too but that isnt a drama so really im asking or saying is there any real good reason you have to change it it was perfectly fine before keep in mind im not accusing you of anything for now im changing it back my regards 
 thanks didnt know all this as i havent seen the start of predator 
 no problems at all the start of predator i will asume you mean the movie by the way that fu picture was put there before the top picture i uploaded that a while ago 
 just wanted to apologize for not having gotten around to going back to take a second look at 
 thanks for your help i respect your opinion if you can point to any awkward bits that might be improved i will try to do so 
 if you could make changes responsive to the comments i made just before the fac was closed (at 
 with all due respect wts complaint is basically wrong i could only find one example of a quote that could be read as if it were presented as fact i changed it and 
 the specific suggestion is to look at every use of a parenthetical phrase and to try to rewrite it without using parentheticals using parentheticals amounts to using a footnote it interrupts the flow of text and distracts the reader from topic at hand if the point is not important enough to include inline in the text consider deleting it 
 i did look at them but will again 
 the cited reference seems to be a pr blurb related to the release of her book i know this is a delicate issue and im not claiming i think it didnt happen on the other hand stating this as fact in an encyclopedia article fundamentally based on one autobiographical reference strikes me as inappropriate id be happier if we directly cite the autobiography and have text like she says in her autobiography 
 not a pr blurb but an article published in two reputable newspapers a fine secondary source will look at rephrasing anyway 
 again this is a case of elevating what shes said to fact the wording in the forbes reference is at N she quit stripping to act in adult filmsmainly to retaliate against her beau who had been cheating on her as she tells it we have dropped the as she tells it and now present this as a pure fact 
 the askmencom reference is an interview and she volunteers oral as her signature move the salon article is also an interview and the interviewer calls this her signature move id imagine signature move would have tons of more authoritative sources these two strike me as pr attempts to establish this as a signature this is another case where an actual secondary source would be helpful 
 just curious whom would you consider a wll known reviewer of pornography 
 you mean the estimate in the infobox the point is that this is a fact that id expect to find in this section i dont really care about the specific years but this appears to be the period in which she was most active 
 i believe you are misinterpreting the point which imo is that much of the content is in the realm of unnecessary detail comprehensive is not the same as exhaustive 
 important to whom 
 to her and to the article its a serious effort to try to join those two rather contradicting modes that she tries to do so is worth a few words 
 so in short i did some disagreed with others especially the cut by half parts and there are a couple of bits i could agree to remove if i could be convinced they were motivated more by the effort to genuinely improve the article rather than just shorten it for wts less than satisfactory reasons 
 just thought you ought to know the nominator has been indefblocked for socking (this guys been around a while see 
 others seem to have been working on it as well i will take a look and see if something can be fixed to get the ga passed 
 thanks for dropping me a note about the article otherwise i would have completely forgotten about it 
 ok thanks hopefully he doesnt screw around with it once i get to work on ithe tried that with 
 please have a good think about how terribly incivil this comment is no one 
 since there are now two comments on my talk i will respond there as opposed to watching this page in following this message 
 as someone who does frequently edit the cvg space i agree with aaron furthermore your wholesale reverts were inappropriate especially since a number of the things you reverted back into the articles in question were either completely broken or simply irrelevant junk please be more cautious in the future 
 hi dana just a heads up to watchlist 
 will do thanks for the heads up 
 hi i know your a ga contributor or judge so if you dont mind my asking what can i do to make 
 thanks for all your help and input 
 congrats on the featured article status 
 thank you thank you im still walking on air 
 hiya i have renommed 
 of course its okay whenever you have free time is fine by me many thanks [ and nbsp 
 do you care if i copy our dialog above to the articles talk page seems more appropriate there than here 
 please do great minds think alike i was just thinking i should do that btw most of the done bits were made by addhoc after the fac closed 
 i have addressed most of the issues in the peer review just one thing the belief that komodos were deaf was in the citation at the end of the paragraph 
 thanks for your insightful comments 
 i looked on the talk page of the article and the editor does not seem to be taking my concerns seriously therefore i am posting 
 update the editor responded and said he would get to it on the weekend this article is a solo job by this editor with over N edits logged see i dont think there is any way this editor can have the perspective to do the job and mdash 
 i consulted with an experience gar editor who also has degrees in psychology his opinion was to put it up for gar now sharing the concern that the problems were massive and that the one editor had lost perspective it took me over an hour just to figure out the heading structure and attempt to figure out roughly what the sections contained the gar process is meant to be constructive and lasts a long time in the first part editors offer suggestions and also help to fix the article it is only when the conclusion is reached that the article cannot be fixed enough to remain ga that the process moves to the second stage in that stage editors vote whether to delist or not the outcome may well be to keep it as a ga article this is a very slow process and can last months i did this because i think the editor is too close to the article and cannot possibly do it alone here is a way to get the constructive input from many editors regards and mdash 
 sorry i took so long i have been rather busy offline i found another two refs but more than half of the refs are still fields refs i think thats all i can do for now best 
 thanks so much for your kind and thoughtful help through my first ga heres to many more 
 hi again anonemouse i should probably be asking this at a project page but you always seem willing to give feedback i am thinking about putting the video or film lists at these japanese actress articles i edit in a tablelike format im experimenting with the idea at 
 for this specific question i went to see how 
 thanks again for taking the time to offer more excellent advice i think you are right about the bright yellow heading at top being overly distracting i copied it off the article i like the eric bana and henry fonda ones better wondering if it might wind up just being a lot of busywork when i should be doing real work on the articles though anyway i will tinker around with the idea 
 hi dana i will make a couple tweaks to the hiw article and see if that helps the bloat a bit im pretty much pissed at the one set of comments at peer review which appear to be contradicting everything we have been told to do everywhere else by everyone else i might have gotten too snarky about it but the guy also went into horses in the middle ages and flipped around a bunch of sections for no logical reason so my position is that just because one reviewer says we have a problem doesnt mean we should just roll over particularly when its primarily the same person i prefer to fight over it a bit and see if something more useful and specific comes out of it just fyi 
 allright i will stay out of the article for a bit then i have made some responses to the peer review page i agree with some of your comments some of the things that he was commenting on is personal preference and his preference appears to go against the current norm at fac however i think we are going to have to cut some information from the related modern uses section for this im going to comment further on the talk page in just a minute 
 i will reconcile your edits and mine noticed we had an edit conflict hang on i have to go move my car and will be out of the article in N min or so 
 ok this time i promise i will go away for a while i just couldnt resist jumping in i will go find something else to do for a whilenot like theres any lack of articles that need work p 
 just fyi that i am sort of going through the article section by section trying to cut verbiage without removing actual content in the process i cut things that appear to be redundant and occasionally have found stuff that is in multiple places that can be consolidated overall trying to see what can be cut without chopping whole sections if i screw up something just holler at me i will probably be off to do other things in an hour or so from now 
 haha your welcome they are well that makes it easier for you then not to be a something but i have another one up 
 caught me between edits noticed my typing mistook and my slop of the keybood well spotted thanks 
 thank you 
 the page is getting smacked literally every half minute or so and i think the jokes worn thin give us a break 
 id say every few minutes but thats still a lot and different ips so we cant just block them semiprotected for N hours just curious why did you pick me as your admin of choice 
 no particular reason at all you were the first admin i saw back when i posted it was being vandalized roughly every N seconds to a minute thanks for the break i areally wish this place would go accountonly sometimes 
 you do realize that jimbo has broken wpauto dozens of times despite making it if its important to the project as you say perhaps jimbo doesnt understand the project as i have said he follows rules only when he feels like it and he and his supporters critize others for doing the same thing 
 oh absolutely hes also broken 
 thats because i want to improve and he doesnt all of us as wikipedians should strive to improve ourselves in any case i apologize if i seemed too confrontational that definately wasnt my intention and 
 understood to be a good admin you have to be able to hide your dislike of authoritarian figures among others lets just put it you have to be able to hide your dislike in general good luck 
 thank you i will try my best to do so while still being honest and fair with people even if i disagree with them im glad you were able to lend me your wisdom 
 i was actually going to work on your suggestions today regarding the ga nomination for 
 i have made the corrections to this article and renominated it when you have a chance please tell me what you think 
 i apologize for taking so long on this article the corrections have now been made to it 
 the next time i want to dislike jimbo do you mind if i vent more quietly here instead 
 heh heh sure why not feel free however dont think that i will be able to affect him in any way im just a mouse 
 lol im not too concerned about him im concerned about how you mop wielding mice types view me p 
 it basically does xml parsing and building for us so we dont need to worry about escaping things redirects are fine served as is however if you wanted to include a redirect or similar if it was a redirect that would be alright and give us something to use if requested later probably keeping it as one file with something like and formatxml makes more sense to me uN 
 great thanks i will look at getting this into use one minor thing could you add the text above to the top of the page before the actual xml it just then means that browsers such as ff will render it and such thanks uN 
 ok i put that in i also put a contenttype text or xml charsetutfN header in which made firefox happy ie forces you to download is that a problem 
 i want a cookie and some chocolate milk 
 that sounds good right about now 
 hello i noticed that you have done quite a substantial amount of work in reviewing articles at the 
 you are awesome i would love to just have a couple of reviews of my reviews just to see if i am doing everything correctly and to make sure that i am looking for the right things i appreciate the fact that you are willing to dedicate your time to helping me out i have already done a couple of your suggestions i will be out of town for about a week but when i get back i will try to do a couple of reviews thank you very much for your response uN 
 will do uN 
 when i found those evidence he became mad and he started to go around and accuse me of insulting him i earlier had a lot of problems with nationalists and i was not aware of so many rules in wikipedia so i used to break N rr rules i felt i should defend articles from nationalists now i am aware of that ivan damaged wikipedia because he nominated so many good photos providing false information and after that photos were removed i think after earlier strong warning it is time to block ivan original account because i dont have will anymore to discover the damage he prodoced to wikipedia every now and then 
 meanwhile please note this we are here to make the worlds best encyclopedia not refight wars in text form that means that the thing to do here is not to make enemies and try to have them blocked the thing to do is to write good articles when someone says i dont think there are x million bosniaks i think there are y the thing to do isnt to go running to an administrator the thing to do is to find a good reliable source that says there are x million and include that in the article if the other person then finds a good reliable source that says there are y then you include that too and note in the article that there is a substantial disagreement remember also that while people are human and will get mad and will have bad days and will make mistakes the odds are good that most editors you will find here at least at first came here to try and make the worlds best encyclopedia try to cooperate with them honestly 
 ok thank you 
 thanks for the support im worried that i am being too thorough with the christina milian review i realize that this article is a gan not an fac and i dont want to cause too much work for the editors since i can be a bit of a perfectionist uN 
 you can never be too thorough with reference checking especially when it comes to blp articles to be honest you are probably more thorough than most other reviewers but thats not saying you are too thorough if you see the difference there you are doing a great job on the reviewit helped that you chose an article that was in pretty good shape 
 wonderful thanks and i didnt realize reviewing would be so time consuming uN 
 im still keeping an eye on the milian articleit looks like you are doing a great job a very fine effort for a first review and keep up the good work 
 im going to be traveling for two weeks so cant watch 
 meanwhile bon voyage what are all the facs going to do without you expect to find nothing but pokemon in the lineup for the front page when you come back 
 i spose they will survive without me thanks 
 i just wanted to let you know that i have modified my initial suggestion to where 
 input inputted put in better not go farther considering the subject matter 
 weighed in have you seen 
 sure i will take a look sometime tonight and ndash 
 hope you understand from the subsequent reviews that i was merely doing my job i was not out to sabotage a legitimate ga and mdash 
 and im possibly sorry that i threw a monkey wrench into the whole thing 
 yes mattisse i think i understand what you were trying to do and montana definitely no monkey wrench i appreciate your opinion and thank you for taking the time to look over the article 
 anonemouse would you kindly block this new sockpuppet thanks N N march N 
 sorry this has been resolved thanks N N march N 
 yay for 
 double yay hooray hooray go dana go 
 thanks you two it couldnt have been done without your help 
 thanks for the notice i appreciate it perhaps i will but not quite this minute i have been undeservedly rude to good people and dont want to do it again 
 pages i edit are not purely architectural there are several including one fa which is nothing at all to do with architecture in fact many are concerned with boxing and prizefighting so when speculating on my credentials you have a far wider and more dangerous field than you thought 
 i apologize i was out of line i removed those comments rephrasing the statement i did and do mean the part about respecting your work bish had a point that i was misusing her talk page to debate her friends who were harmlessly blowing off steam please go on writing good articles whether or not you want to seek the star for them and please do go on using her talk page to vent i should not have jumped on that and shall avoid it 
 ok forgotten forgiven lets get on with what we are here for 
 hi dana thanks for your work can you please contact me via the email address listed on my userpage thanks 
 great job 
 thank you just following in your footsteps 
 hi anonemouse i noticed that 
 specifically in this case i am inclined to urge leaving epbrN alone a bit yes he did push the boundaries of making a point by a string of afd nominations but his explanation that he did it in good faith to determine deletion standards is also possible and i am impressed that in at least one case he changed his mind due to good arguments and some of his nominations were fully worthwhile ones note that such noted champions of 
 as for the editor account that has made massafd nominations within a couple weeks of its creation showing a prodigiously swift capability for learning the ins and outs of wikipedian procedures i join you in hoping it will be a productive member of the wikipedia community 
 i dont want to be a pain but just to let you know the wikitable on cyclone elisa should cover elisa being the weakest named storm in N as there have been no tropical cyclones in the spac this season yet 
 thanks for the review danna 
 hi anonemouse i assure you i hate this kind of timewasting as much as you do but not do the afds keep on coming he has marked 
 i begin to see your point ( 
 furthermore prior to your post on his talk page he removed a majority of his talk page without showing where his archives are since his deleted contents are not sequentials and in responde to the deletuion he said mind your own business i would say that he actually deleted them in bad faith and i 
 hes now blanked pretty much the whole thing without archiving i tried being nice about it and explaining to him that he should archive and he blanked me too sigh 
 on the other hand he didnt tell you to mind your own business or call you a nutjob lamenta count your blessings 
 yeah reported to 
 i have counterreported you for harassment 
 i am owned by a leopardspot appaloosa gelding who is way smarter than me and we occasionally compete in endurance who wins you or the horse i will get me coat 
 well it made me smile incidentally someone that my user page seemed to imply i had a 
 hey there royalbroil i thought your idea on the 
 i did some minor changes overall i like how you put the page together 
 i dont know if you are interested in businessrelated articles but if you are would you like to take a look at 
 all done 
 sure thing i will be right over and ndash 
 whoops my apologies its usually safe to assume that anybody who edits wikipedia on a regular basis is a male computer geek like myself and ndash 
 i went ahead and shortened the season summary since there is no real consensus and people have jumped upon a new topic within the project to respond to let me know what more if anything more can be done with the season article 
 the issues from the second review should now be addressed 
 it is legitimately a candidate for speedy deletion the fact that he acted out in the way that he did brought scrutiny on his contributions and was a catalyst in bringing it to my attention uN 
 aaaaaaaaaaaaa it looked like it might be going well finally after that chat on epbrN s talk page then i log out for a few hours and its spread to 
 just a heads up since you were involved in this last time it looks like betacommand has started up with the indiscriminate link removals again 
 on further inspection it seems like he is going more slowly now that is a useful difference if nothing else will reduce the amount of damage 
 replied to your email thanks for the birthday wishes as well 
 you are welcome for the response im glad i was able to help regarding that vandal from yesterday yes he did remove warnings from his talk page but that doesnt matter it was the trolling that got the talk page protected not the removal of warnings evidently that vandal was a fan of me 
 hi anonemouse it appears that after that very wellreasoned advice you gave epbrN he has instead of thinking his actions over redoubled his efforts at disrupting wikipedia a dozen in one N hour period whether they are made in good faith or not its clear that these afds have become a disruption and are wasting a lot of peoples time in the process whatever his 
 no no 
 i would likely agree i havent even looked at the article sure shoot willynilly into a crowd of pedestrians and you are bound to hit a crook now and then too but thats hardly constructive the thing is there are so many of these afds coming up so rapidly i dont even have time to look into them all but isnt that a good a sign of what this is becoming twelve nominations in one day theres no way i can look into each one of these sufficiently or even in passing not to mention the fact that im not really interested in the american models anyway except in preventing pov massdeletions im on the verge of saying to hell with it and just sticking my nose back into researching japanese subjects and leaving the rest of the afds up to whoever has the time and interest to fight it meanwhile hes attracting an ew porn delete group of followers is that maybe what hes going for and if so should he get what hes going for 
 thats the very definition of 
 im not sure what needs doing now or if there are further modifications required is there anything you can point me in the direction of 
 hmm sorry i hope you didnt think i was asking you to fix any problems for me only point out where they were and id do it thanks for making those further reference changes dont know why i didnt spot them myself 
 i just wanted to stop by to let you know that i have passed the 
 you are very welcome it is always good to see conscientious new reviewers working on the backlog 
 my understanding is that she has an old user page which has her own name and no longer wants to use and that she worries that if she opens a new user account she will be accused of having dual accounts as sockpuppets if that is correct she is being punished for being conscientious i know there is a way to delete an old user page that contains the users name as the right to disappear she may need advice in any case she has done nothing wrong so why is she being punished by not being allowed to edit the article 
 i am not trying to force her to get a new account or open the old one i am asking for what is considered the most basic wiki courtesy signing her posts end of story 
 sethie is basically right 
 i have finished fixing the issues if you have time it would be nice if you could take a glance at it cheers 
 would you please mind explaining your reasoning i removed nearly all the heritage preservation society references and i fixed all the other issues that you brought up 
 sorry to trouble you again the nominator is now significantly editing his opening nomination statements to make them appear to have addressed keep arguments before they have been made ( and for example hes also changed the notable number of films at 
 no he actually changed it back to N from N which is a good thing as i didnt notice the drop either as for changing the nomination statement thats not a capital crime for legibility it probably should have been put as a response to the keep argument but thats a fine point it was quite short before one word he did evidence a misunderstanding about the N film rule in a few places which i addressed at his talk page come on hes making useful comments on the 
 ok searching the edit history appeared to show that youd made the N change forging ahead 
 hi dana per your question about this 
 dana can you trot over there and take a peek reply optional but fyi peter is now bringing up all the hiw pr stuff 
 yeah i have been watching it everything seems to be simmering down now so i was just going to leave it alone i will watch anything that comes to your talk page and comment as i feel inclined to for now how about we agree that when you feel snarky come vent to me first and then we can work stuff out together eh grin btw i liked the archer stuff that you added to hiw more on that to come over this long weekend 
 pi is still not ok with it and wants to drag it out sigh yes i will try to remember to email before panicking people 
 thanks for your constructive criticism so far with the history of minnesota article your suggestions have helped the article become better organized 
 i have been keeping the fac on my watch list but not the article itself you seem to have gotten everything i asked for supporting 
 i notice that you have blocked this user i had done the last block escalating to three days from previous one and two day blocks i approve of a week this time per the 
 im not sure what you mean here cn is for discussing community blocks right are you proposing one seems unnecessary personally i see poor deathrocker as a well intentioned user who doesnt do well with things like rules if there is a way to keep him from being indefinitely blocked then id be in favor of it i just dont know how to do that if i knew anything about heavy metal i could try and deal with the individual issues but i dont 
 i was suggesting that a year block effectively amounts to a community block im not proposing one but i think wpcn would not be an appropriate place to bring up a case like deathrockers 
 i agree i dont plan to bring it up there and didnt think i suggested it im still not sure what you are proposing 
 im proposing we ask the community is this it one more and its a year no questions asked can someone be his buddy for a time etc basically is there anything we can do to save the user and or or is he definitely at the last of his lives 
 sounds good to me go for it make the section and i will sign on 
 i will on the last day of his week block assuming i dont forget 
 see 
 oh fyi selona is editing the sorraia article arsdelicata is editing paso fino two different people lol 
 hi dana i dont know if you remember me but you reviewed 
 no problemthe first is sooner than i expected i see you seem to have quite a few requests on your talk page anyway thanks again 
 hi now that 
 hello well thats precisely what i have done fixing all links that had something to do with egypt to the correct target 
 wow i do using 
 wait what theres nothing even in the article that talks about a N eccentricity also i guess you could call the sentence about moons a weasel worded sentence but if you look at the context of it all it seems to make sense the habitable zone is socalled because it was a theory that seems to leave a lot of factors out and really isnt so accurate and it is very difficult to find earthsized bodies out there much less small satellites 
 sethie is right about what she has done nothing wrong so why is she being punished what she is doing may be inconvenient but thats all this situation is unfair and she should be allowed to edit i dont understand why you asked for my okay i have nothing to do with her and anyhow it is not as though she is guilty of something she should be allowed to edit if she is not allowed to edit please explain why not 
 sethie is basically right that getting a user account and signing posts are both good things my post goes on to give details protection of an article isnt punishment admin tools arent for punishment they are for protection of the encyclopedia i didnt unprotect the article because that would be basically taking the responsibility that the ips edits to the article would be constructive i was not willing to override kylus judgment without research and since even you who are better acquainted with the ip than i am were not willing to vouch for her in any case that semiprotection has now lapsed though can be reinstated if needed 
 hey there i noticed that your first attempt at creating a page is much better then mine anyway its true the sources didnt work and i would have added them back pretty soon anyway and in all fairness i should have probably made an attempt at fixing them myself a few things however first off you said at the bottom something like more to come you dont need to put this in if the article is short then its short the only thing you ever need to put in for that is a stub template or an incomplete template but you are still working on the article so i wouldnt bother one other important thing however you mentioned at the bottom that your article was based on someone elses work or something i cant remember the exact words what is important however is how much is based on that article everything that is done here must be written in your own words even if the information you are getting is from another site in which case you must provide a link to that site in the way you were sourcing things once it is written in your own words you dont need to bit at the bottom mentioning that it is based on someone elses work if you do put that there someone else will probably just delete it 
 a bit more searching revealed which is probably what you want 
 canvassing is highly discouraged watch for me next month i will nominate myself sometime next month even this might be considered canvassing by some 
 i understand about canvassing thats why im specifically asking to be notified see 
 i have responded to all your comments at 
 thanks very much 
 as a reviewer at 
 i will take a look at it tommorow 
 http or or wwwescapistmagazinecom or news or view or N theweekinreviewbearssurveysandthewrongcoloredhair 
 are you seeking to promote this article 
 well i have not played any of the dmc games so i wouldnt have much to contribute aside from finding these references 
 just a heads up 
 december you mean january right i will be on deck lol hey when are we going to get thoroughbred up there 
 whenever raul schedules it no clue when if we were maschocists wed request it for a date but im not that mascocistic you will see this mornings excitement on the upper case or lower case issue is only the start remember i have already had an article i watchlist go on the main page (
 sometimes i wonder why we bother at all hiw will never go fa unless pi goes away its totally hopeless am i the only person getting so tired of all this nonsense 
 then with hiw stuck lets work on something else maybe push 
 as far as possible fas id say one of our less controversial articles and honestly i dont think that would be 
 im trying to avoid any sign of partisanship on pushing arabians 
 hehe i was wondering about that well i think the thing that the arabian article is most in need of is references which i dont think i will be of much help on as i dont have the library that you two do however im more than willing to act as copyeditor or reference formatter or cheerleader if you two would like to work on that one ealdgyth do you think that suffolk punch is long enough to get to fa and if so what do you two think is still needed on the article perhaps post the answer to that on the article talk page also we could look at appaloosa as thats probably pretty close 
 we have three foci N fas N gas and N getting the total crap up to at least b class if i were to vote on a great project for any of the above i recommend 
 you wrote since even you who are better acquainted with the ip than i am were not willing to vouch for her i am not better acquainted with her than you are or if you think i am supply some information to support your claim moreover you have not explained why she needs someone to vouch for her since she has done nothing wrong in addition she is an adult and and can vouch for herself if you feel you need some sort of promise of good behavior why did you not ask her the issue being discussed is antisemitism and your blocking her has made editing much more difficult for me once again the issue being discussed is antisemitism and i want to be sure that you understand how serious that issue is and how seriously i take your actions in this please do not describe this as a procedural issue she has been editing for some time and has been a help to me since wikipedia allows editing without a user name and since she is a key participant in editing of the article and since she has done nothing wrong i would like you to ether allow her to edit the article or supply a detailed explanation why not thank you and i look fporward yo your reply 
 please reread the last sentence of my previous reply i hate to sound frustrated but there seems to be a pattern of your missing rather important parts of my comments 
 considering your rather head over heels slobbering support of elonka dunin during her request for adminship and awarding her a barn star for alleged undeserved criticism when her poor behavior was quite well documented and her vote was filled with sockpuppet votes i would humbly suggest that you certainly arent in a position to put her name back on notable persons lists and have any sort of reasonable expectation that people should treat you as an objective outside observer she simply does not rate notability guidelines to be mentioned as being notable for her geographic location the world does not revolve around her unlike what she and you seem to think 
 i restored the links to 
 now lets see what do you believe notability guidelines to be mentioned as being notable for her geographic location are and what is that based on 
 hi jaga i have disambiguation question for you i am wondering why 
 thanks for the note if the biblical character is the 
 thanks im unfamiliar with the move process can you describe it a bit well i must respectfully disagree with you (and with 
 check out this 
 ha ha joke is on me for not noticing the link in your first post i do respect your opinion i just dont agree with it i placed the move request on the article page thanks again for disamb help 
 sorry about that we seem to have hit that one at the same time i requested a checkuser be run as theres some evidence but its not proven there is that alright or would you prefer i withdraw the request 
 perfectly all right as i wrote i was simultaneously over and under whelmed by the evidence a checkuser would also be ok 
 i will make a note though so far out of half a dozen checkuser requests i have made for ssp work not one has been approved i guess that has discouraged me from seeking them heres hoping you have better luck though 
 we shall hope if not it will just stay closed as inconclusive i will make sure to check back next time though and note what im intending to do before doing it hopefully that will keep from crossing wires again 
 well we have brought up a lot of articles that need to be worked on how about this if everyone agrees im currently in the middle of posting some suggestions and other stuff to the hiw page so we can keep pushing along there then i have already dropped a section on the suffolk punch page where people can toss comments on what it needs before fa and i dont mind being the main force there with just simple input from others then lets take a vote between pushing horse to fa or beginning work on laminitis ealdgyth i know you mentioned founder which is currently part of the laminitis page so i figured you wouldnt mind this as a final choice grin my vote would be for horse but im willing to go along with whatever you two think thoughts 
 my work in real life has just taken off like a shot for the moment so my participation will be unpredictable the next week or so but my personal priority is hiw for which i think my brain is beginning to have an idea of how to fix some of the big organizational questions so if we can confine work there to a pace that doesnt get too dramatic or overwhelm me until i get my act together that would be good as for the others i will go with where you guys are motivated because i wont be a lot of help for a bit i will probably be more good for feedback than actual editing work 
 im fine with continuing to plug along with hiw i kinda figure given its military implications its always goign to be a joint project horse would be my vote because quite honestly vet stuff leaves me cold i like the idea of sp being worked on and maybe some more arabian work too no reason to only work one we are all very diverse folks and its more fun to work a few different ones so you dont burn out (i speak from experience i just finished two days hard work on 
 i am groovy with moving on horse i note we are also trudging toward getting lipizzan ready for ga thats probable the next ga ealdgyth you havent edited as much there maybe peek and comment my real life is seriously getting crazy at the moment took too many cases that are all are coming together at the same time so id sure be grateful if a note on anything really dramatic that gets proposed is passed to me over email because i may not get onto wiki every day the way i have in the pastmaybe not even every other day anyway it will be lucrative at a time its needed but volunteer tasks are going to suffer 
 as a courtesy note i have mentioned an edit you made in a discussion at 
 on the same subject i think your was a tad harsh for a case like this it is obvious to you and me that this candidates nomination will not succeed but it is not obvious to him and of course a strong oppose is exactly equivalent to a regular old oppose in the eyes of a bureaucrat why not use the friendlier option especially considering that this is a new user who does not yet have a clear idea of how the rfa process works abruptness is not only unnecessary it may have material consequences for instance driving away someone who might very well become a valuable editor the comment directly previous to yours was thoughtful and constructive i fear yours contributed nothing at all this is of course only one mans opinion but i would very much like to see rfa regain its former atmosphere of constructive criticism and collegiality avoiding the 
 i am sorry what saying strong oppose is a violation of 
 hi actually p has been posting as 
 that account was blocked in december by 
 ps i see above that betacommand has a request for arbitration opened against him i believe that might help show that the problems were not with an adminbot but with the person running it on the other hand he and i argued over this most viciously so i dont want to appear to be just kicking another wikipedian when hes down 
 hi i am the one who nominated the 
 thanks for the heads up i have taken a look and posted a reply on the review page 
 trimmed lead replied on review page 
 my name is jaromir i am definitely a man thank you very much for your words at have a nice evening and good luck i would like to tell you the good luck version of a friend of mine good luck in everything you do good or evil under the condition that you treat this evil part as a joke 
 you are welcome some people take this place much too seriously 
 yes you are absolutely right greetings from poland today i have no time for a longer conversation but i hope it is possible in the near future i like your picture and i appreciate all your wiki badges 
 thank you very much i dont think i did all that much though your other watchers seemed to in most cases beat me to the revert 
 every little bit helped gmg got a lot more vandalism than 
 thank you very much for reviewing this article 
 piotrus and i think we have addressed the issues successfully 
 wow politics football and pop culture you are quite versatile
 i apologize 
 thanks i will get through this 
 thank you very much for helping us solve that issue anonemouse happy easter 
 how about another look
 thanks for the advice
 you have pobably seen that its at afd guy has already speedily deleted the article on the bmovie festival which i have placed at 
 one at a time 
 moved the temp page to the 
 thanks for the barnstar let me know if you need anything else cheers and ndash 
 your contribution and evaluations of the students work is greatly appreciated the otter article was challenging at the very least to critique the combination of an honest evaluation balanced with solutions has been a life saver for young trevor trust me on that as he stated somewhere the learning curve is steep it helps when you have someone willing to help push if your not a teacher by trade then you certainly could be the banker horse article developed very nicely from a stub as well i like the compact topics which tend to be more encyclopedic in nature she seems to have exhausted the available resources im not sure if there is enough content to make fa i suspect she will likely give it a shot the semester ends tomorrow thus the flurry of activity will likely slow as the students shift back into procrastination mode again thanks for all the help and attention 
 page size shouldnt be an issue with banker horse and fa its N + words well within the realms of possiblity given that dana and montana were helping and given that they know my stringent standards on sourcing im sure sourcing wont be an issue either that leaves pictures and prose which im just not qualified to judge very well but if alexis is willing to endure copyediting by others then there is no reason not to try for fa 
 yohmom did a great deal may want to redact students real names even if just first names admin lar knows who has privileges to do this as far as the article i was a certified high school teacher for N years prior to a major career change my hat is of to both students and teacher for a creative assignment well done everyone id say that yohmom did a much better job of putting up with being edited than most adults im just impressed all around 
 hello how are you i hope you are fine anonemouse i ask you the administrator for a permanent deletion of my english wikipedia user page my talk page and my list of contributions as i do not wish to identify with the project and to leave it forever thank you 
 anyway i can delete your user page and talk page but not your list of contributions thats an irrevocable part of history is that good enough 
 thanks for your message ok i will appreciate if you remove these pages i mean my user page and my talk pages thank you 
 if you really want to leave and disappear leave your page red thats better than protection 
 thanks for saving heck horse from deletion and doing a total rewrite in N hours im seriously impressed you rock deah 
 lol thanks for being impressed the articles not that great just a tossed together bunch of sources that were the first thing that popped up on google but i think it covers the subject fairly well and i guess its better than a copyvio and deletion 
 hello again i have just placed the proper templates i would like to ask you if you could protect my user page and my discussion page from being edited by removing the edit this page section as i left the project and i do not want the pages to be vandalized by anybody it would be a peaceful situation for me as well in case you want to say something i ask you to place your statement under this request message at your talk page please i will appreciate it 
 see you are not blocked i want to leave isnt a reason to block someone if you want to leave you just leave however that means you can also come back whenever you feel like without any hassle and when or if you do it would be useful for people to be able to communicate with you without any hassle so unless you really have a strong reason to suspect they are going to be regularly vandalized id prefer to leave them unprotected 
 anonemouse i do not intend to come back here and i will never do so i want no wikipedia members contact me in the future i want to have nothing in common with the wikipedia and the commons projects including the proper foundation i ask you to protect these pages as i explained earlier i believe i as the leaving user have all the rights to have these pages protected that way the template i placed is very informative thank you 
 no at least nothing i could find on 
 quotation of your words but my reading of policy and usual behavior is that protection is only used when it has to be not just when its asked for i may only answer to these words of yours in that way that is also one of the reasons i hate the projects if you are kind enough explain to me here why some of the users are protected that way see the case of the user phaedriel for example 
 well i didnt protect it so you will have to ask those admins (
 that wasnt protected at phaedrials request it was protected on my initiative partly for extremely sensitive reasons and partly because people were failing to accept she had left i have no objection to deleting the users page and talk under the right to vanish but im puzzled as to why protection should be needed 
 i ask you again the administrator to protect my user page and my talk page ie to prevent them from being edited by anybody by blocking peoples access to the edit this page sections of the pages mentioned earlier i do not understand why you all are not willing to accept this final decision of mine i see it as the attack on my personal rights i will appreciate your understanding and acceptance of my decision 
 hi i have responded to your comments at 
 okay i have responded to everything and made the necessary changes thanks 
 hi the text below is the combination of the current template and the special case paragraph that i copied from bio can we have a sidebar from the furry and discuss where we differ on the specific wording if you feel this is inappropriate go ahead and revert this comment and i will understand thanks 
 wpprof wpmusic and yes wppornbio are like that there are notable and nonnotable professors but the dividing line for them isnt the same as for normal people publishing a dozen booklength articles makes most people notable for a professor its just average if no one reads the articles similarly there are notable and nonnotable pornstars and the criteria that make them notable or not are not the obvious ones either 
 hi dana i know i just trashed your sandbox please dont take it personally i know you do really great work but we dont need to do this massive a reorg i have worked too long and too hard on the article to see it totally mixed up if this is what is ultimately done it will take me weeks to properly restructure everything to a sequence that will pass muster in terms of historical chronology and i dont have the time right now you also have my rant on the article talk page please we are friends and i know i just went ballistic and snarky so forgive me but pleasemaybe we just need to let this project cool totally for a while 
 hehe careful i might take you up on that you seem to be swamped with nominations all year around are you the only active reviewer in the royalty or nobility area right now my next step will be to ask someone to take a look at 
 you banned this user and his sockpuppets back in february it appears he is back as 
 yeah again tough call but the edit history is very similar and the information added is consistently uncited and does seem to be false will block 
 do you have any news from our friend crzrussian i was very saddened when i found out he had left the project i dont know what made him take that decission but i hope he reconsiders some day 
 as for crz i asked but he was coy i think it was a combination of factors some of which i know and some i dont part was when 
 hi and thanks havery much for doing another review my responses are ready at 
 thanks again 
 hidana boomer i forgot to thank you up front for stepping up to review this article i bet we both wish it was always so quick 
 you are quite welcome and yes i wish nominators always nominated articles in that good of shape and responded that quickly to the issues i bring up it would probably make the backlog at ga go down thats for sure 
 to me the idea that one is allowed to be bold or iar is about being free to try most anything once after that proper procedure and so forth is needed as anybody continually doing anything makes no sense at all with regard to 
 i actually think the current article is near optimal neutral phrasing covers everything lots of citations and watched by lots of eagle eyes daniel brandt seems to be objecting out of principle rather than out of any specific and actionable complaint 
 i think it is more complicated than that but im not sure i care anymore 
 regards 
 fine whatever i retract the comment and perhaps i should mind my own business go ahead and apply the punitive block or have one of your friends apply the punitive block obviously i should stick to something more useful except im not sure if i do anything useful around here who in the hell gives a flying rats ass about some old flour mill in minneapolis maybe you can tell me 
 also i probably should shut the hell up about buildings in chicago since i dont live there in fact i have really annoyed a lot of people in chicago 
 i confess i was putting this in the queue to lessen the wait time i have made a lot of improvements i have gone throught newspapers for her time as a judge N and part of her time as a lawyer N or N or N i still have to add N or N take your time with this review because i will not be finished with this article for about N hours
 i have now filled in N to the best of my ability
 if you know any magic words regarding photos of this nature too you are welcome to email me i have been uploading stout book and dvd covers and N d art with no problem whatsoever but dealing with this particular image category is something else thanks again 
 what you need to do is go to 
 by george look at that im educable all fixed thanks too for linking that list which made it go faster and i also discovered that the tag promophoto is old hat now the tag is now nonfree promotional 
 hello do you wish to continue your request to not merge several neighborhoods into 
 i do not see justification for such an indiscriminate merge as already explained if you call for any votes please make sure to inform editors interested in those pages and related ones especially 
 cheers and ndash 
 thanks good luck with the fac and ndash 
 hooray hooray fa fa good for you 
 i should have known you were following that brad i think those nw pages are getting better and better 
 i read your discussion with ghost i strongly disagree with removing the record which shows a technical chart regarding the historical performance of a fighter in a viewer friendly manner not all wp readers are interested in reading the entire article to determine the results of a match please direct me to the link that shows the consensus is against a record did boxers fail to meet ga or fa until the chart was removed or was it never there the two are not mutually exclusive the best example is the 
 there is no consensus only a template to follow of all the articles that have been promoted only 
 because wikipedia is not paper if need be we can even create an subpage such as 
 i have been forced away for quite some time so there is really no point in continuing old issues ghost lets set the tables to a default hide or collapse parameter and let them stand happy holidays 
 i think you have the potential to be an admin speaking of i think i will leave a review for you rock on hope you like the awards i have given you xaN adios 
 sweet im gonna get an award wahoo and an originally made one one too xd you are such a cool person i think i will give more barnstars really you are lacking way too many and im glad im your wikifriend anyway i think i will stop replying i think im taking up too much space on this talk page gahh oh well i think i will make your edit review in a while oh wait can you help me on something how do you make a signature with all the colors i dont understand it please help me if you want to not take a lot of space here we could discuss stuff on my talk page my take page is cherry so we can take space there if you dont mind muchas gracias y xaN adios 
 hey anonemouse thanks again for your careful screening of the above article i was wondering if you had a nymore comments to give or perhaps a support if you feel they are addressed if not please air your concerns so i can address them as soon as possible thank you 
 thanks i responded there i edit less on weekends many fixed some not other issues i think that as long as raoul sees that you are addressing concerns he will leave it up until you either address them all or we hit some kind of impasse 
 i have removed those sources that were questionable and would appreciate your final comments unless you have more 
 thanks for your review i shall be working through it over the next couple of days i will be replying on the review page obviously 
 maybe i will have to just remove it he taught there until N then move the preceding apologia ref to after that sentence pending further investigation what do you think 
 hi anon im not quite sure what you mean is the section where people say that the shorter version is clearer and describes whats currently done if thats what you meant 
 about one statement from each minimal backandforth just a statement of where each stands klaquot offered a compromise that got minimal response and isnt what you are writing i know you are more experienced than i am but can you really read that and call it agreement 
 you forgot andrew lenahan in support of the shorter but as you know these things are never done by numbers the editors who want the longer version include some with very little experience and some who have attitudes toward blps that id say are directly opposed to the spirit and letter of the policy 
 i counted him hes starblind note that the longer version is also the one that was there before the one that came up so we are talking about making a change to the spirit and letter of the policy here id rather not cast stones at specific editors especially since i suspect if you look at it hard enough i will be among the stone targets instead can we actually try to reach consensus by that i mean something most people can at least live with instead what we have is a revert war something we as admins really shouldnt be doing what with serving as an example and all 
 i wasnt referring to you by the way im losing track of what we are talking about to be honest the sentence is after deletion of a blp any admin may choose to protect the page against recreation that is demonstrably true its what currently happens and its been happening since i started editing two and a half years ago so there really is no problem with it when it comes to admin actions the policy should describe the best practice of experienced admins and thats what it does 
 thanks once again for your reviewing my responses and changes are done see 
 thanks again 
 i have made most of the changes you suggested per your comments would a new section describing which areas of the world which experience a wet season be added instead of merely saying areas which have a mediterranean savannah or monsoon climate regime it would bulk up the article some if nothing else 
 i have replied to your latest set of comments and supplied the N isbns 
 thanks for that see what im worried about is that its too short all it says is that any admin may choose to protect any deleted biography it says nothing about not every one needing it that the protection should be temporary that other people may have the same name that another admin may choose to unprotect later sure you all say on the talk page that all that is obvious but its not and its getting written in to a very important 
 if any new admin starting protecting pages for no reason whether a deleted blp or anything else someone would put him right long explanations of when to do this but not that arent helpful in policies they end up not being read for one thing the more succinct the guidance is the better as a rule and then it leaves admins some room for common sense 
 see by putting that sentence there its no longer no reason its a very good reason it says so in policy and frankly even the arbcom would uphold that if the text survived a few months note that im not asking for much just a note that 
 the policy cant be governed by a guideline the sentence explains what admins currently do and may do as i said this has been happening since i started editing here its supported by experienced admins on the page its succinct and clear i cant say anything else about it 
 anyway thats the entire problem just a few posts above you write that if someone actually followed that text as written they would be put right surely you are not favoring adding incorrect information because its shorter if its wrong its not at all clear 
 hello dana i just uploaded two photos which you might find useful to the sorraia article specifically id sure like to see the lead mention in addition to the primitive color that the convex profile is something the sorraia is also know for remember at first reading una was under the impression the sorraia was just a color breed and the lead still leaves this impression and i think we can make it better by mentioning the convex profile and showing a photo down further in the article see what you think if you want the photos you can find them on my talk page okay 
 i think you put the photos to good use dana and the placement looks good to me i hope others feel the same 
 hello i have improved 
 never mind see you found it 
 yup already found that one thanks anyways though 
 in a sense you are correct about adminship but mostly only in theory in practice admins generally represent longer term experienced editors who have gained the trust of the community thus their views tend to be weighed more heavily regarding adminship yes you are an admin in fact i supported your nomination as far as i know though you are the only admin who wishes to change the current policy the other editors attempting to do so are i believe not admins 
 actually i dont support changing the policy check what it looked like just a few days ago before this nonsense started none of this stuff was there its being put in without any consensus 
 when the contentious issue is the level of detail in guidance rather than the substance of the guidance the opinions of less experienced editors should if anything count more experienced admins are not the audience for the passage in question 
 is there such a breed as this one described in the article the reference to a www site does not talk about this breed at all is the article real or a spam kind rN egards 
 thank you kind regards 
 thanks for getting involved i created a brand new article called 
 it is fixed now but do keep a watch on it if you can thanks 
 why would you start over from scratch when the article already existed you shouldnt have two versions of the same article in mainspace at the same time 
 hey i think i come upon N sockpuppets trying to advertise or promote 
 rollback is just a fast way of undoing what one editor has done it doesnt allow you to rollback more than one editors work so rollback isnt possible in this instance the best way to clean up this article is to go into the history of the article find the last good version edit that version and hit save page 
 i have posted the 
 hmmm let me think i would suggest trying 
 thanks again for your help 
 i did have 
 among other things i have been thinking about adding an additional section titled 
 hi are you part of the military history wikiproject 
 thanks for being so fast in answering me well i did a few months ago an article in portuguese about the 
 i also presented predrag matvejevic analysis he wrote the number of arab volonteers who came to help bosnian muslims was much smaller than the number presented by the serb and croat propaganda also i restored information about bernardlevy description that you removed as well as mladen ivanic petition that you removed so please dont remove sourced information per wprs and finally i included hartmann source because it is reliable per wprs 
 only person who lie is you you ignore official icty sources confirmed by hartmann she added to answer the second part of the question that izetbegovic was one of the suspects under investigation as part of the current investigations but the fact that he had died meant that all legal proceedings against him were dropped asked to confirm that up until he died he was under investigation hartmann replied that this was the caseyou ignore information that numbers of elmudzahid was between N N is well sourced citationintelligence services of the nordicpolish sfor sector alerted the us of their presence in N while the number of mujahideen operating in bosnia alone continued to grow from a few hundred to around N in N so please assistention needed here 
 please no personal attacks as i said i included hartmann source let me repeat once again i included hartmann source and again i included hartmann source regarding arabs first the number of arabs is not the subject of the article in the first source it says information was given by anon source it is not relaible source per wprs regarding second source it is a serb lobby site and the exact number was never confirmed by icty as you know arabs are mentioned in the article upon their arrival not in N nor N nor etc and i will be gled to discuss with you in arab volunteers related article about the numbers etc because i have exact sources 
 the 
 oic my comments are on the 
 it is not true so you didnt tell the truth because i included it and wrote that in summary the other sources are per wprs 
 hi dana boomer i saw you are down to review the lord denning article and just wanted to come by and say id be interested in pitching in with comments to the review page it was one i was interested in possibly reviewing myself depending on how swiftly i progressed with my other reviews a note on your talk page seemed a good idea as there isnt a review page transcluded just yet and ndash with your having freshly taken it on some reviews stay open less time than others so thought id express an interest in case i missed the window i wouldnt start the page myself of course and ndash itd be like opening someones magazine or choc bar before they had d best 
 just a note to let you know i have added my thoughts in the review the article for me has prose or jargon or style problems and is a bit unfocused at times refs too of course which you brought up im not sure my leaving a kind have list would have been well helpful or encouraging so plumped for mentioning the main areas i felt needed attention uN 
 hi thanks for letting me weighin there dana i made a few suggestions for the most part the nominator was quicker than me in making the little fixes i made a few other minor edits i think the article looks good i will back out now best 
 i mostly agree with you i will try to adjust it 
 it is nice that all part agreewonder oh wonderi have also started with adjustinglets hope that we will not make fight again 
 i knew it but it is hard to believehe start to play games again with editing i tried to copied exactly as you wrote but he revert again and making as he thinks that it should bei would suggest you to protect page and to make self edits 
 hi splash i saw that you recently deleted 
 i had meant to add that it was an aN no indication of notability of software deletion but missed the menu selection unfortunately it was no stronger in the versions existing in earlier years when inclusion standards were rather slacker than now 
 aN specifically excludes software articles specifically states that that books albums software etc or schools are not eligible under this criterion please undelete the article so that i will have the opportunity to expand it without having to start over again 
 there you go 
 thanks for restoring the article i have added a couple references to it take care 
 just want to note that it would be reasonable to describe the article as promotional since it was apparently created by a user associated with the producer company research triangle 
 the military history wikiproject coordinator selection process is starting we are aiming to elect nine coordinators to serve for the next six months if you are interested in running please sign up 
 the february N 
 you might want to state your thoughts where this dispute has continued for weeks i personally agree with you that it is since N or N that cole has really gotten a lot of attention i dont see the need to delete the whole section but your thoughts might add some perspective to the discussion 
 im not sure if you got the emphasis of my comment i dont see those two sentences as a big deal the difference in content is minor i dont think the game is worth the candle so if a mediator really wants to mediate thats great but since my personal feeling is that it is not worth it i dont think my coming in and writing that will help it might even offend the mediator who has after all devoted a fair amount of good faith effort to the issue 
 i have answered your query at the images talk page on the same page in response to your additional question here korean does have a separate category on the map cyrillic and greek do not have separate categories but are both members of the alphabet category 
 we have a new editor trying to help out here but i have reverted two good faith edits already chance you can put on your welcome hat 
 done good luck with the books 
 thanks always happy to help hope your bookshelves are coming along well its always so much easier to have books on shelves as opposed to in boxes 
 what do you think 
 no offense but i dont know much about 
 an ip has been removing present from tables in nsw electoral district article tables making articles inconsistent with each other i raised the matter at 
 not sure what to do either or it does fall under 
 this user btw is clearly 
 well i suppose that solves the problem for now 
 yeah i have been ridiculously busy of late and wont be available for wikipedia stuff until around N june i will deal with it then i need to visit the uwa library anyway for other purposes so can do that while there 
 ok thanks 
 you are talking to the wrong guy about that but it never hurts to remember or be reminded to be polite so i will see that you do too 
 what no offense but i dont recall ever editing writing about or ever reading the article on 
 hi dana boomer thanks for all your ga work im commenting here in response to the ga fail of 
 hi geometry guy and thanks for your comments a few replies no there is no place in the ga criteria where it says that each section or paragraph needs to have a reference the ga criteria though specifically links to wpverifiability which says editors should cite sources fully providing as much publication information as possible including page numbers when citing books which would seem to encourage the reviewer to ask for as much information as possible especially when it is easily provided info such as publishers and access dates and no they dont require that every bullet pointed reference in the references section be linked to an inline citation however in fully developed articles it is most often the case that works in the references section that do not have corresponding inline citations are there by accident the main editor forgot to remove or move them after removing the corresponding inline i like to point that out to editors in case this is the case but if someone argues with me and gives a valid reason for it im more than willing to back down 
 okay thanks for your replies i noticed you did a nice job at alan kotok too encouraging a content contributor keep up the good work 
 by the way forgot about your getting married thing congrats 
 thank you its actually labor day weekend but i found the userbox and figured if i didnt put it up now id forget it 
 oh then now is a perfect time to also be doing an rfa lol 
 most of the prep is done its mainly just a matter of crossing our fingers and hoping everything goes as planned now but i figure get all of the stressful stuff out of the way in one swoop and then be able to get down to the nittygritty article writing afterwards 
 clearly your mother is not like my mother lol good luck 
 on the other hand after the wedding who knows when we would have talked her into an rfa strangely though despite the reputation i didnt find rfa any more stressful than an fac or flc they are both putting up your words and letting all and sundry come and comment on them in an environment where you can be forced to discuss at length things you thought were no issue at all 
 thank you very much i plan to get more involved in these again once things calm down a little bit in rl in later fall 
 goodie you should also seriously consider standing for 
 i will have to think about that im not really sure im involved enough in milhist things for me to actually have a shot at being elected although i do enjoy reviewing the projects articles 
 thanks for passing 
 heh if articles were ever perfect wed all soon be out of a job here on wp it looked good to me 
 thank you for your comments regarding my nomination of 
 absolutely improving the article is the idea i will return give me a bit of time sorry about the mess comment i guess it was strong i was mainly struck by the leads concentrating on his voice height and lack of sex life meanwhile leaving out items of lesser importance such as why he was a controversial politician what party he was from or how or why he was shot 
 if you look on the ga tag it states if it no longer meets these criteria you can delist it or ask for a reassessment i followed the delisting bit delisting without a gar has been done before and i have also done so with 
 i do see your point and i normally would leave a note on the talk page however no one was actively doing anything with the article which is why i went to wikiproject novels this time i will drop a note on the talk page and wait a week if no one reponds or objects without proper reason or improves the article then i will go ahead and delist i do think its good that you are seeking the line to be clarified i remember being confused and nervous to actually delist anything when i first saw it honestly i wouldnt mind if the only way to remove a ga was through reassessment while i wont delist an article unless it significantly lacks supporting materials and like getting second opinions there are those who wont not to mention reassessment may bring attention to the article even if its just from people who dont like losing gas i will stay posted on the discussion concerning the line as well thanks you 
 hello dana boomer i provided a new table which evened out the distribution of the flags i have also replaced unreliable refs with new reliable ones and made notations on those which are in spanish in one case i added the information in regard to the authority who wrote the piece in question which is one thing that i should have done in the first place thank you 
 dana boomer you have made me do a lot of work to tell you the truth i have enjoyed every moment of it there is one thing though your last request all of the websites still need to have publishers given im sorry but i really dont know how to do that i hope that this minor issue doesnt affect the ga thing i mean i have taken the whole thing on by myself and maybe someone in the future will come along and do the last request 
 dana thank you not only for your review but because you are one of the few reviewers that i know of that pitches in and lends a helping hand the thing that i appreciate about your comments is that you have helped me make this article a much better one i has been a pleasure interacting with you 
 thank you for the N per cent endorsement on the rfc and i have responded there to your comment about the other N per cent which i hope will clarify the matter regards 
 easy guide to find reference to a new user in perticular case i alone need not toil to find references with title like if you doubt a sentence its easy to find reference in N steps which will make any visitor research little and improve verifiability these days vandals are educated and their 
 thank you for bringing some muchneeded attention to this article you can see i have been largely on my own with it until your review and some wonderful improvements have since followed thank you for reviewing the article i wish i could be more active in the ga process but im in the middle of an overseas move right now so it may be some weeks before i can do any more im excited about what is happening now though cheers 
 i have renominated 
 i understand completely thanks for the reply 
 didnt the fall in sales start in N wouldnt it be more appropriate to amend it the article implies it started in N which isnt the case 
 the article says that she had a dip between the early to mid N s its comletely fine uN 
 hi anonemouse im ahem not very experience in starting afds myself i have just put 
 you missed the step (in

 old joke for example 
 reminds me of the old couple who went to the doctor for an aids test they believed they were in a highrisk group because they had sex annually 
 hithe reason i had removed public education in il is because the category looks like it is only for school districts and it is empty except for that see 
 oops i could have sworn there was 
 sorry for all the confusion 
 i think you ought to reverse your fail of this article for two reasons the fact tags you cited as one reason were placed there by a confused person they were inside a block quote which has a prpper citation at the end of it the clearly shows that to be the case as for the npov discussions the npov dispute you have to consider that jokestress is not a neutral person on this she is a person who in real life campaigns publically against the use of the very term this article is about as it says on her talk page she is 
 everybody voiced her or his concerns the article is currently in desperate need of a copyedit and a brand new lead feel free to drop by greetings 
 thank you for helping out with the broken dois in 
 thank you for the tips i sporadically audit articles i have worked on in the past and im going to use crossref and the other suggestions for references with broken dois

 thank you 
 grrace please leave dana alone shes just the messenger and you are incorrect please see 
 heh its all ok montana i left a fairly complete explanation for my actions regarding the above on grraces talk page and asked her to take further discussion to the article talk page and our discussion there doesnt seem to be a big deal right now 
 whew thanks i do not need yet another big deal 
 barnstar moved to awards page 
 wow thanks after akmasks nice comment my day is now complete and couldnt be ruined by two arbcom cases and an rfc bring on the vandals 
 actually the whole point is that they werent deleted for any valid reason there isnt a single derogatory or disputed line in that short text without quoting the text thats just my word for it with quoting the text its obvious 
 oxford and websters are superior sources to wp 
 dictionary sources added above in case you need to justify them i dont know anything about horses but if you have any problems with lexis semantics or grammar dont hesitate to yell on my talk page 
 i noticed you are an administrator and was therefore wondering if you could help im not sure how much you look at the year articles here on wikipedia but im sure you know of the convention that articles whose titles are just digits should be about that particular year (like 
 it didnt have a major effect as redirect were automatically set up but moved back and 
 hi dana boomer just to let you know about the above gar in which s editing practices have raised a question mark over the articles ga status your comments about whether on revisiting the article you believe it meets the criteria or not would be most welcome 
 it has now been delisted 
 hope this helps 
 im ok with you cleaning up what you have and popping it in all i have is some stuff out of bennett that may or may not expand the history section so dont wait up on account of me i havent reviewed your last draft but if i get to it and have any comments or thoughts i will pop them in you do great work so i dont fret much 
 hi i have seen your review of this article for good article standard and i have done some work on it could you please check it out and tell me what you think i personally think that most of the sourcing issues are far gone by now cheers 
 i was even considering making a featured article request because of what atleast i can see most of the subject of trouble people pointed out in the first failed review has been taken care of by other users in a good way 
 please note that there are many states that have cr N besides new jersey like florida for example please first do the research in making sure that cr ### only exists in new jersey before making redirects if you are not willing to do that i suggest that you delete the redirects and make a standard disambiguation page for all of them then tagging the new jersey cr as a bulleted list thank you 
 please recheck your google work if you look at 
 hi i have been working on 
 im adding a plug for this effort the article is really wellresearched the organizational structure is strong and cc has been working really hard on this as far as i can see her research looks to me to be close to impeccable i am too close to the article to help with a ga review because i have been helping and maybe even occasionally contributing something useful so any help you can offer will be much appreciated 
 yup im going to help just had to find some time to get to it also being close to the article doesnt preclude you from helping with the ga review it just precludes you from being the reviewer once i jump in with my two cents i wont be able to be the reviewer either same with ealdgyth however between the four of us we should be able to turn out an article thats ready for gan 
 thanks i was going to add a mention on adultfyi about felicias baby to the article when i found it was not longer around i will do the rebuild later on today 
 by the way recall a few months ago i offered to nominate you for the ability to see deleted articles among other things 
 yeah yeah i remember that i still dont think im at the point where i know all that i would need to know so im not ready to take on an admins fuller responsibilities but i am definitely sliding that way especially since i have had a couple of sharp exchanges with others especially over the issue of 
 gracias for welcoming me to esperanza that was fastanyways where should i go again to test out the drop down table the sand box talk page 
 no problem and yes it would be great if you could test it on my sandbox and ask questions on its talk page to avoid taking up too much space here thanks or or 
 i have decided to do that trading places thing because im not feeling too well to be editing my entire pageand it would be a lot less off your back i feel woozy right now gracias 
 oh no its perfectly alright i really dont mind that you cant get it right and im okay with just a regular barnstar wait what did i just say confused ah well my point is im fine with whatever you give me sorry im pretty ditzy and i dont know what you see where am i going with that gaaahh im seriously off topic okay xaN gracias errsayonara oh and thank you for the nice words you gave me on my talk page it was very kind of you 
 go right ahead thats how i got all of this stuff in the first place i just looked at other user pages and copied whatever i liked or or 
 its alive care to critique the reborn 
 well done 
 thanks for obtaining the nice picture of 
 you are welcome but i wouldnt overstate the importance of any one picture on her life considering she has had so many does she actually say something like that anywhere 
 you may want to eyeball this one which is getting some attention and if you note edit history there appears to be two political factions 
 didnt have it watchlisted before but i do now and will keep an eye on it i dont have my books right now but will in about a month so might start playing with it at that point if things get heated between the two factions i will step in and start asking for sources from both sides but at the moment it seems to not be all that hot 
 also seems to be a kid wanting to tweak the 
 watchlisted that as well expanding this article is on my todo list for when i get home 
 see 
 thank you 
 no problem go right ahead its a pretty good photo 
 why did the iau even have to reclassify what a planet is in the first place shouldnt we be able to work with the way a planet has been defined before i think spherical objects that orbit the sun works just fine (unlessof course the iaus planet classification binder was running out of space 
 wikipedia isnt really the place to discuss this its primary purpose is to report not to debate however i think you have slightly misunderstood the article until N there had never been a single fixed definition of planet even dictionaries tended to define planet in a rather circular way saying things like a planet is larger than an asteroid or comet and then defining asteroid or comet as smaller than a planet there is no definition that cannot be picked apart for various reasons even mandating that a planet orbit a star is a bit controversial since it gives planetary status to boring rocks like mercury but denies it to fascinating worlds like titan it also denies planethood to any potential rogue planets the most allinclusive definition which is favoured by astronomers like mark buie is that a planet is anything big enough to be round but not big enough to fuse hydrogen this would basically mean that any object discovered in the universe from about a fifth the mass of our moon to about N times the size of jupiter is a planet it would mean that kids would have to give up learning the planets in our solar system since the number would go from eight to about N and that is the main issue the word planet is not a scientific term its a term tied to myth history and religion its special is it right that tiny bits of ice at the end of the solar system should be so honoured or should the term planet be selectively bestowed only on those that deserve it this isnt a scientific issue but then planet has never been a scientific word 
 thats actually a pretty good definition but i think you should add that planets have to orbit the sun directly this is not about how interesting something is britney spears is interesting but she does not fit the definition i have made for music that i like to listen to another good addition i believe would be to mention that planets must be unique that is there should not be an abundance of like objects in the immediate vicinity and finally if the definition of a planet is not a scientific issue then the iau should leave the definition to people in linguistics like the oxford english dictionary 
 your definition is basically the one the iau chose to adopt as for why they did it in the first place they didnt have a choice they kept under the rug for as long as they could then eris turned up and everything went crazy believe me they didnt want to do it eris forced their hand 
 you are right but i think the iau should have worded the definition differently 
 im moving this here since it really doesnt belong on the articles talk page unique isnt really any less ambiguous than clearing the neighborhood no planet is truly unique each shares its orbit with dust particles micrometeoroids the occasional comet and many other things if you read the 
 thats what i meant the mathematical definition is less easily definable in laymans terms than unique as in no objects resembling it in the immediate vicinity 
 resembling it how 
 in size shape and composition for instance pluto resembles kupier belt objects but earth does not resemble venus and what i meant when i said that the iau should have worded their definition differently was that to someone who had not heard of the mathematical formula or read the article clearing the neighborhood could have referred to the present or the time of formation 
 earth and venus resemble each other rather closely its only in atmospheric composition and tectonic activity that they differ yes clearing the neighborhood was a vague term but the conference was not long enough for the iau to establish a fixed mathematical value for the planetdwarf planet dividing line hopefully the next conference held in rio in N will go some way to address this issue 
 want to try it again from the top without the loaded words just the facts about the article in question and the edit in question 
 dont take this personally but i will present the issue for you as a theme rather than the minutiae of the articles my statements are framed to move your empathy to the fore that is what i hope to achieve which is why i have contacted several notable admins to the defense of npov for the sake of an entire people but westerners who fought against the ottoman empire in wwi did not make the turks pay for the 
 now do you understand my problem this isnt a crusade this isnt a genocide this is an encyclopedia we write articles here thats all we do if you want an uninvolved admins help i can do that but please confine yourself to the article thats all we do here now whats the dispute 
 why there is a political spat over nokota horse i wonder oh well 
 no idea people pick the weirdest breeds to fight over its on my todo list to source which will hopefully stop the infightingi just got sidetracked by the 
 ah thats more clear thanks let me go look at the articles in question 
 thanks for taking up the review i have been waiting for so long i have simply forgotten about that article i will add the citations where they are needed soon cheers 
 im very busy these days which is why i havent been addressing the issues you raised in the operation badr review i will fix these problems sometime this week so id appreciate it very much if you would keep the review on hold thanks 
 what about the activism that got a homosexualized version of greece into academia in the first place we all know it is not how europeans viewed the greeks in preottoman times so the matter is reclaiming face from institutional defamation if that is considered reactionary activism well why not listen to their side of the debate thats what npov is all about not just the liberal or conservative both must be represented for what they are in their own words and even refuting charges of their opponents why do you believe that opponents of the historical revisionist wing should not be taken seriously i gave three prime examples of how greeks are degraded by other groups propagandas but you balk at the notion of defense before mass media stereotypes as too steep a slippery slope i know it would be much easier if this were some racial minority women or homosexual interests boohoo suck it up ethnic minority of paramount importance to european image and legacy excuse me this is not directed at you but why dont people grow any fucking balls in this pc mad world go watch 
 thats where we get back to this project not being a crusade or a genocide just an encyclopedia we dont change what the world thinks here we just document it sorry if thats not what you thought you were signing up for but thats what this project is about good luck 
 say dont know how much time you have spent at the project that took fire while you were moving but see 
 well im trying to get ya will to source it somehow that always seems to work out to me digging out the books and doing a source pass every couple of weeks 
 we also need to come up with a general policy on alt text for horse colors and such between the icelandic ga and now the spat at clydesdale horse i wonder what to do seems danas solution at icelandic horse is the best horse 
 i had noticed the glossary but just didnt have the time to add anything else in looks like you gals have it covered i will figure out some way to add it into the portal but i think i will wait until the featured portal process is complete before i change more stuff 
 theres an article on 
 sorry i must be missing something because im not sure where the above comment fits into the rest of the discussion 
 oh maybe i just didnt read it carefully enough 
 im curious as to what were you trying to say with the link to horse color though was there someplace you thought it should be linked or something it could be added to or added to it not trying to be pushy you have just got me really curious as to where you were headed with the link 
 just for alt text giving the horsey colour plus a description of the colour like dun type of thing for ordinary text you can link the colour 
 ah gotcha yeah all of us in the discussion are fairly familiar with the various specialized horse colors its just figuring out what the alt text gurus want that is the issue also having a set policy for this sort of thing will make it easier when we are dealing with random editors trying to add alt text to breed articles and using terms that visually impaired readers may not understand and not being willing to add normal colors to it as is happening in one of the other breed articles right now 
 well alt text for the visually impaired is obviously needed so i suppose there could be an almost standard description of colours but also i dont think these colours are necessarily the same worldwide are they do you have strawberry roans in the us do the brits have cremellos do either of those mean a thing to nonhorsey types 
 hee hee i was the lead editor on the last big cleanup of 
 both definitely both as in bright orange 
 lol orange now that id want to see 
 i had a chestnut irish sport horse and i have to say bright orange was really the only adequate description 
 if you feel something needs vertifying add a fact tag next to it and i will supply a source however trolling the article and rolling back improvements including the adition of a free image showing local irish people playing the sport is entirely unacceptable 
 there is nothing to stop people improving the quality of the content while the title of the article is been discussed if you dont like the sport fine but dont hold back the progress of its article 
 this is nothing to do with not liking the sport i just asked you no to change every reference of soccer to football in case it needs to be changed back in a few days time 
 well whatever the case of your intentions i see you have added some fact tags thanks and i will work through those starting with popularity football is the biggest participation and most popular team sport in ireland according to the esri with an estimated N people actively involved on a regular basis 
 i just came here to thank you for reverting the vandalism on my page well vandals end up blocked sooner or later and this vandal got blocked already again thanks 
 no problem although it was kind of stupid of me to practically invite him to come and vandalize my page instead by saying if you are going to vandalize a page why not mine 
 i saw you talked to 
 yes you may we didnt reach any conclusion there i mainly stopped due to fatigue relative to importance of the issue 
 hi anonemouse looks like i have got someone tagging for deletion all the promotional photos i have spent months hunting for the message im getting is the fair use image you uploaded is replaceable by a free one these are all portraits of the models in question at sites which sell dvds or videos this meets my understanding of a promotional photo its also my understanding that a promotional photo is usuable hence the promophoto option in licensing am i mistaken and have i wasted valuable limited internet time in seeking to improve these articles i sometimes wonder about the mentality of editors who get their jollies by deleting the hard work of others but as always advice will be appreciated 
 i wish i could tell you better news sorry 
 thanks anon i see now that this was yet another attack at the japanese category through a proxy this time by 
 i noticed you are writing free photos are unlikely to be found thats not strong enough because we are now just amazingly popular with millions of editors some of whom are happy to go out and make free photos you need to be a bit more specific because in most professions just being retired isnt a reason photos cant be made for example a retired politician will probably be happy to pose for a snapshot for an encyclopedia you want to show that the person in question is actively avoiding photos so not only are new photos unlikely to be found they are likely impossible to make see the recluse bit there i dont know what the social situation is for japanese retired porn stars but if you can find an article that says they tend to avoid publicity like the plague that will be strong ammunition 
 thanks anon better now 
 on the other hand if these facial portraits are all removed i suppose i could instead put up images of the videos being discussed next to the appropriate section of the text video covers are generally far more explicit than the images with which i have tried to illustrate these articles but if thats what the rules demand 
 hi thank you much for your review i fixed all the three issues if the word contested is still unclear it may be removed 
 thank you again 
 if you have time in the next week or two would you mind reviewing 
 reviewed well done in fact im surprised giano is opposing it the prose is not brilliant kind of vague without specific examples 
 thank you i have addressed your comments to the best of my ability let me know what you think i was surprised giano opposed as well but he did give a couple of examples of objectionable writing tics anyway now that i have copy edited the article two more times i hope that the writing is even better 
 congrats on the fa for icelandic horse my question i dont want to glom onto your hard work and you unquestionably did the fa push but i did originally put hours into that article to clean up the base and do some sourcing would you object if i added the fa star to my user page as a contributer to the articles fa status i dont want to claim credit where credit is not due so its your call and i wont be butt hurt if you feel that you cleaned up a disaster that was my previous version let me know 
 next fa push hmmm what about 
 hi dana i always meant to pop by and say thanks for the ga review you did for an article which i wrote (
 you are quite welcome it was an interesting article to read 
 we got another sockpuppet 
 yup ( thats the pattern bratz wrestling and now harry potter i see 
 cheers 
 thanks for the comments i went to a few users for help with copyediting but they were generally too busy could you suggest someone who could help me on this point cheers 
 since the article title if 
 you dont get it do you those articles are about the sport as a whole not its coverage i one country so its an entirely different situation look at the standard i gave you for the sport in a specific country england 
 bear in mind that rfc bot pays no attention to 
 i actually wasnt talking about your bot i was talking about the bot that creates 
 that makes sense just that i am working on a ganrelated bot of my own and when i see mentions of bots i think of my own 
 agreed i was thinking of reblocking myself after i took a closer look at the pattern thanks uN 
 thanks good to know you support it 
 i am sorry about giving you a hard time yesterday this extended argument is making me irasciblealthough that is really no excuse so sorry 
 i put a note on gwinvas talk page shes not a horse person but she is a new zealander so maybe between her and cg they will spot anything really off youe been doing a lot of really good work on these wow 
 thanks for some reason i had thought she was from gbmy bad 
 she was living in gb but moved back to nz a couple years ago so you are partly correct lol by the way i see you have a new toy i have never been able to figure out how that works but looks like you are doing way cool things with it 
 yeah i got bored last night and installed that and huggle just to see what all the fuss is about they are both fun but i doubt i will be using them on a daily basis awb is good nice though for spell checking and small errors along with general formatting 
 have they improved the instructions i looked a couple years ago and the details made my eyes cross 
 im not sure not having seen the instructions a couple of years ago however i didnt really go too deep into the details i was mainly experimenting last night with the basics spell checking and other basic features i havent tried using any of the custom addons or anything i have a feeling that the coding on those will make me need a couple of advil and a good book 
 a yes coding yes that was it you are a brave person to get as far as you got congrats 
 i really could not add much to the article except a link to a tv programme that i saw a few days earlier you may care to check 
 thank you for your commentsN N november N 
 anonemouse thanks for your support on my rfa i should apologize for snubbing you i thought about contacting you before putting the rfa up but didnt want to run afoul of 
 dont take the snub comment seriously i see there was a long line you are a great asset i see you sprung straight into action with 
 before you recommend admonishment and potential desysopping i would love for you to find an example of bad behavior by me otherwise you are just encouraging people like johnN to take differences of opinion to the noticeboard hes using blp as a stick and thats not what its for 
 sounds good give me a moment i will either find specific conflicts of interest between the two accounts or withdraw my comments 
 neither account participated in either of 
 a less charitable soul would read that you are using two accounts to give the impression of more support on a specific controversial edit a poster child 
 i would ask you if the jack abramoff articles represent poorly sourced inaccurate biased slanderous coverage of an incredibly complex and controversial case or not they are certainly not perfect (
 i did not see the edits to the template given the timing that is a problem it would certainly have been better to name your alternate account 
 # acknowledged that if it were found to be desysopping at the least would be appropriate 
 one thing to note is that the mean stuff about norquist is trueit was unbalanced but not defamatory as johnN is arguing another thing to note is that i wasnt the one who originally contributed the content johnN is so unhappy about another thing to note is that the sources we can draw on for political figures primarily the political press write about the controversial matters involving political figures and its generally what makes them interesting and how they affect history its often true that they love animals and are excellent cooks or voted to rename a bridge in a community leaders honor but that has little bearing on their place in history that said for example i agree that the grover norquist and americans for tax reform articles need more content about their work and philosophy and i welcome another editor contributing that unfortunately editors seem more interested in deleting information than adding it sometimes 
 hi dana thanks for very useful comments at 
 thanks dana 
 hey if you wanted to upgrade 
 email received i will see what i can do on the article i should have some time either tonight or tomorrow 
 im not sure if you realize there are two issues here one is that you are arguing with an editor who is not an administrator about a specific edit or even specific series of edits to a specific article eh im sure thats important too but thats not what i am primarily concerned with no one is advocating deletion of the whole article and im sure it will work out one way or another the other is that a highly experienced user one of maybe N of the most experienced users on the whole wikipedia an administrator has maintained an untagged alternate account that has been used in conjunction with his main to edit quite a few rather controversial articles for over a year while quite a few others believed it to be a completely different person for example look at 
 i recognize the distinct issues i disagree with your interpretation of 
 hi i was quite surprised that you failed this gan without even noticing the nominator on its talk page that you left any comments as far as i know when someone reviews an article he should announce the editor especially when he gets no response in a decent amount of days considering that i was a bit inactive in the past two weeks and my watchlist contains N + pages i havent seen that you posted any comments on swiss air force talk page plus not counting that the gan was placed two months ago and i completely forgot about it however if id knew of your comments id certainly address them since they werent very serious issues best regards 
 good enough thanks i will take care of the issues today and let you know when the gan is reopened cheers 
 thats good to know especially as you are looking at it from the new pages angle as jaga and i have mainly been looking for them by page moves tigretiger lit up both but i doubt they all will its also good to know of at least one admin familiar with the case as hopefully i can just point them at the sock and they are spot it without all the hassle of collecting evidence for a spi 
 as for 
 im going to wait and see i dont want to be accused of fishing i have left a note about the users behavior at 
 can you do me a favour and keep an eye on the 
 let me see if i understand this correctly tabercil the model herself is volunteering images and these are being deleted a lot of us uploaded images with the understanding that fair use was fair use now those images are being purged en masse knowing that free images will be deleted too eventually will certainly save lot of time messing around trying to provide those images 
 i have advised her to put them up with creative commons license i forget the original reason for the deletions offhand but i suspect it was something along the lines of copyvio in that she supposedly didnt have the license for them 
 i have looked around through the history of her 
 i worked on the article a bit want to comment on 
 hi dana thank you very much for your comments in the 
 thanks cheers 
 if you have time you might want to take a look at 
 ack the problem is that im not nearly a physicist so dont know whether sentences such as by cosmic standards gravity throughout the solar system is comparatively weak are as good as can be written without blowing the readers cerebral cortex or as vague as they read to me on a larger scale though no doubt simplified the article still isnt simple the hijackers idea that simplified articles are bad in themselves is directly contradicted by a mos guideline so if it looked like the debate was coming down to that id certainly say so but it looks like there are enough people who are more comfortable with the physics saying so that i dont need to i will try a few more times to read the article itself so i can actually give some intelligent evaluation or criticism at the fac but cant yet sorry 
 im no physicist either but i have read a lot of explanations of general relativity for the layperson (in books such as 
 hi dana our new wpeq member pitke is working up a storm on 
 i have looked through my stuff and nothing beyond the trusty simon and schusters book of horses and ponies 
 anything there that agrees with existing content we can use to supplement any of the finnish footnotes pitke is concerned that the generic us breed books may contain inaccurate information particularly about the color genetics and patterns but where they are correct i think it helpful to add them i think article has the potential to go ga if we can avoid citation issues 
 theres also a brief entry in edwards encyclopedia of the horse on the finnish horse which may be the same thing however both of these entries are very brief and have nothing that expands on the information already in the article i dont think the preponderance of finnish sources will be a problem as long as they are properly noted in this case i think the finnish sources will probably be better on this subject although pitke may have to present translations of some of the sources upon request of the ga reviewer if the reviewer so chooses sorry i couldnt be of more help i think in this case the generic books arent going to be of much help my biggest suggestion would be to make sure that pitke knows what is considered a reliable source as he is the only one of us who can read the sources and so hes really the only one who can judge reliability 
 i have some but im also doing lot of copyediting there for flow and such so im a bit too close to do a good job but if you wanted to pop by and offer some comments i think they would be well received 
 francis was secretly publishing materials for the freemasons rosicrucians spearshakers knights of the helmet as well as publishing the materials he had written under the pen name of shakespeare alice was very interested in fame and fortune and when there were no large reserves of money left in the later years of their marriage there was constant complaining about where was all the money going i am waiting for some additional research materials that i had ordered several weeks ago and when i assemble a rough draft of a paragraph proposal i will submit it to you for your editing and modifactions 
 also i am still interested in keeping at least some kind of mention of the homosexuality bit i understand that the books speculating about bacons homosexuality may not be correct but they do exist we need to say something about them perhaps we could put both that and the shakespeare theories under a speculations section or add additional references to books which explicitly question their scholarship or otherwise argue with them 
 thanks for your timely assessment i took what amounted to a fan page and pared it down considerably i understand that the sections are short but once historical information begins to be added it would open the floodgates once again on info that is already contained in the black sabbath article the only fix i can see is to revert back to a single section which was cited as the reason why it was a start class previously any suggestions would be welcomed 
 the basic idea is you want to have more content and organize it well take a look at the ultimate goal the articles in the 
 on the N nd with 
 ohyaynot im going to have to work for a good part of that day so i am sending a fervent plea to any and all of my talk page watchers to help with the vandal fighting thanks for the heads up ealdgyth 
 she shoots she scores we will help out maybe post on wpeqs talk page too this is the first breed article to go on the main page isnt it we havent put up tb have we ealdgyth had a horse bio theredidnt you and one of the bishops articles 
 by the way congrats on 
 yep congrats whats next (and we really really need to work on 
 i have thought about 
 i think kims left wiki again and talk about politics andalusian yikes appaloosas probably close to ready as is 
 i like the idea of an article on the remount there are several places where it is redlinked already or could be linked quite easily as for a fa run haflinger will probably be like cleveland bay a fairly noncontroversial safe run and good luck horse could go fa with a little work i think the ga fiasco is unlikely to reoccur as the source of that fiasco is now wellrecognized for such things and has been blocked at least once now i like the idea of trying to see if we can get appaloosa to fa before tackling arabian horse because both have long history sections and some controversies over genetic conditions that could cause some blowback on both articles im less emotionally vested in the appy article and could probably handle the process there easier and i can probably get access to material at the historical society if we need better sources on western history plus doing appy first will get us a preview of coming attractions that could arise if we tried to take arabian to fa im even less emotionally vested in andalusian if we wanted to tackle it i think the politics are just going to be an example of how to handle a controversy on wiki the article itself is pretty stable and free of significant editwarring my only concern there is that there is some serious scholarly work on that breed out there probably mostly in spanish and we may need to do some serious sleuthing about the pedigree keeping by the carthusian monks and all that could be fun though and e with your collection of stuff on anglicanism got anything more general that discusses prereformation history of the church and such like the carthusian order and so on 
 i dont honestly have much on spain though everything is oriented towards england sandy does speak spanish though if we wanted to beg her for translations 
 and remount will be fun because there really isnt much written about it i may just write a new book im almost to the point in the house or horse or photography thing where i can start writing again 
 i will check it out should be easy enough im glad you are looking at that report that one usually gets ignored 
 let me know if there are any bugs thanks for the request 
 reply and request for further of your thoughts on that at 
 hybrid proposal that occurred to me based on your ideas that just clicked and i think might actually meet both aims quite well comments 
 i noticed that you reverted an edit and then rereverted it in 
 hi arthur yes i reverted my revert i was hoping my silly mistake would go unnoticed and now you have gone and told the world but yes every admin has a rollback button which makes reverting easy you can read all about reverts and rollbacks here 
 hi elkman i find the infobox to be more unattractive than it is useful couldnt this same information be incorporated into the article or photo caption without this giant jangling intrusion i find it really visualy harsh thank you for listening jim N N april N 
 i removed the infobox 
 quick question do you have these two items on your watch list reason for my question is that someone added sashas real name and linked to a picture of her drivers license as the cite madjabuds pulled the name out but left edit summaries of whoever posted my id better not do it again i have a lawyer iand i dont like using him so do not repost my id sasha grey and if i have to use my lawyer it will be for wiki users not wiki or its staff sasha grey mssashagrey@yahoocom in the process you might want to look and or or act further than what i have already done 
 fine fine i will stand up for admin status im still not sure i know all i should know to be a proper admin for instance i never knew about oversight but you have worn me down on the topic however since you are so insistent on it you get to write the initial rfa 
 well you know now right anyway when in doubt take things slowly ask questions one of the most important things to remember is that there are N + other admins so if you arent sure someone else will know will be sure and will cover for you just ask 
 hey side question we have been going through and tagging the various articles with status and importance tags is it possible to pull a list of all the articles in the pornography category that fall into the stub category im curious if i can spot any other articles that are similar to 
 actually id found it myself rather interesting reading clicking through the categories for instance did you know someone classified 
 yeah i saw that jeff stryker rating and thought about changing but well he is probably the best known gay male porn star eh i wouldnt have marked him more than high myself since i dont think hes really known very much outside the industry but i wont go to war over it yes i would also like to be able to find the intersection maybe a bot would be useful 
 back to the nomination i think its done you like anything you want me to tweak if not follow 
 well i have accepted it and filled in the blank spots i dont see anything in what you wrote where i would have said it differently 
 nameless date stamp N N august N 
 as for N you are using a pseudonym right now you are signing yourself nameless date stamp arent you doing that from an ip is no more anonymous than doing so from a user account trust me no one thinks anonemouse is something my mother named me either the only difference between editing as an ip and editing as an account is that neither you nor anyone who wants to deal with you gets any of the other advantages an edit history a talk page that will stay the same when you change service providers or whether you are editing from your home or an airport after N days the ability to edit semiprotected pages others that an actual account would bring by the way nameless date stamp would be a perfectly fine user name i dont see a 
 by the way we have all kinds of people here at the wikipedia some are cruel and some arent if you need an additional shoulder to cry on let me direct you to the legendary 
 it was probably deleted because all it said was this is a new article and material will be added in the next few days please do not delete 
 nice work on your mommy kills animals 
 whew you liked im glad i was kind of worried you wouldnt actually there are dark rumors floating around about your personal feelings towards the subject but i just couldnt resist sourcing an article that probably would have been deleted without sourcing thank you i appreciate it and thank you for being able to see all sides 
 its best not to believe every dark rumor thats floating around seriously my priority is always good writing and sourcing and your writing is really good it flows really nicely i was thinking of nominating it for deletion but obviously i wont now so thank you 
 i was able to see what you mentioned in thanks 
 i did get to see it thats why i was saying thanks 
 yes i did hear the part about ordering the calamari and about me 
 dana thanks for all the help at far reviews there are really lagging so your good work is appreciated 
 you are quite welcome i try to run through a few now and then please let me know if theres anything about my reviews that is offkilter im rather new at reviewing for the fa processes 
 you are doing great 
 that was a fast response id do the other too but like i noted in the wp comment im not sure which itd be doesnt help that the border between the two ratings is so fuzzy and i have no idea how much more info there is that could be added if theres a lot id say its still start if theres not much go for b but the air force career parts making me want to keep it at start all on its own either she was with them or not whats with all the she says she claims indecisiveness 
 all right lets keep it at start then thanks again 
 hi anon apparently i have found myself involved in an editing controversy help from a third party would be appreciated heres the story as i see it an editor has been removing mention of rape at the 
 i restored the info but was reverted i gave the user a notice for 
 good luck on your new project let me know if you want a second set of eyes and this one is a much needed effort 
 yeah thats probably going to be a slow one it will take quite a bit of time and som ills before it even goes live much less to ga or further cross your fingers for me on this one although i suppose its better than tackling 
 i wouldnt touch the horsemeat article with a tenfoot pole i admire that you are even thinking about it i would have an interest eventually on a collaboration on the laminitis article though its a topic near and dear to my heart having dealt with it personally plus i have a ton of stuff from the horse the research is quite cutting edge our understanding of laminitis is changing almost as dramatically as is our understanding of genetics its going to be a daunting task and maybe one where we dont even look at the existing article and just recreate it from scratch oh fyi speaking of horse health noticing a redlink on one of ealdgyths new articles i created 
 lol 
 from what i have been able to tell one of the editors in particular in that dispute edits mostly for the purpose of reverting a small number of articles and is willing to wait out months of protection in order to revert is there any indication on the talk page that a consensus has been reached i rather doubt it knowing the individuals involved but you could check 
 honestly im willing to try its been N months thats not really the encyclopedia that anyone can edit at worst it gets vandalized we can reprotect but i asked on 
 if i were you id offer to unlock it with the proviso that the first editor to revert it will be blocked for a week 
 sorry i dont know what the debate was about so dont know how to recognize a revert specifically what was the debate about 
 my impression was that the overall readability of the article was the aim and in this i had the impression that the progress was in the right direction regards 
 i guess the crux of the point i was trying to make is that we initially went down a wrong road recognised it just in time and despite it all we seemed to pull it off with the refs reading as refs should bar ordinary bits to fix like missing publishers id have spotted that along with the double up of the tony freerminshull listing in further reading which i will fix just after this message i would only say that if all is not lost lets not lose it regards 
 hi dona i would like to thank you both personally and on behalf of the worcestershireproject team for you patience and perseverance and for according malvern worcestershire a ga kindest regards 
 i concur wholeheartedly with kudpungs sentiments your role must be at times difficult and frustrating yet simultaneously fascinating despite it all you have done a good thing for which i not only thank you but also commend you regards 
 thank you it made me smile d 
 thank you im amazed how few you have i expected a maze of barnstars 
 thanks for your comments on the smedley butler article i think i have addressed most of the things you mentioned however there are a couple of questions that i have if you get the time could you swing back by and see if it meets your expectationsN N january N 
 thank you again for taking time to review the article i think i have addressed all of your concerns but please let me know if you find anything else 
 i think i got them all know 
 hi anonemouse just to let you know edit summary has a typo no offense intended or implied 
 personal attack blp violation indefinite block 
 jeez you are tough should have kept my mouth shut 
 i just noticed you are working on this list i am in the process of rebuilding this list also and was just about to add a bunch of changes i am reformatting this to look like the other medal of honor recipient lists nd hope to have most of it done this weekend please let me know once your done so i dont accidentally undo your edits edits 
 also the home of heroes website isnt unreliable but i use the army center of military history site or the marine corps whos who just as a general rule 
 i got a bunch more photos by email today going to have to step up my efforts to keep up with stay ahead of your images page 
 then quadell clearly knows more since i know little i just got the trusted thing since i noticed its a speedy accept for admins on other projects and that way i could at least tag my own flick finds but then i tagged a few by others as well im sure they can always use more if you apply drop me a note here and i will support you with bells on what do you mean keep up with my images page you have N times as many N o 
 have you checked in every case that they were not notable subsequently for something else 
 the way you are doing them now is exactly right and is a model for what ought to be said in such cases very nice work 
 hi yes i had the starship on my todo list for forever after starting and writing the auckland hospital article please leave a note in the edit history when you are done so i can go at it again one of your edits did remove some stuff of mine cheers and happy editing 
 no go ahead im done for a while at least i tried to do a merge rather than an overwrite im sure its in the edit history sorry 
 yup saw that one but thanks i will work it in soon just need to get some more length to the article to be able to fit it in 
 theres an argument for it to be the lead the other horse is not as attractive though the photo is somewhat clearer your call 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or this was going to be a barnstar of diligence but you seem to have plenty of those already so i thought id mix it up if there is one thing i can count when i see the signature of anonemouse in a deletion discussion it is a wellreasoned thoughtful and very civil argument 
 thank you thank you but dont feel you owe me anything you thoroughly deserved that one 
 by a somewhat convoluted route i have just stumbled over http or or horseincultureblogspotcom or an academic group blog which does what it says on the tin they also have the following group library online https or or wwwzoteroorg or groups or horses_in_history_and_culture or items which might identify some additional sources 
 oops forgot this was here a belated thanks david this looks like it could be a good bibliographytype site for horses in culture type articles 
 i will have a look asap sounds like an interesting article rbN and nbsp( 
 i threw in my two cents its a good article source wise i hope i have made another pony person happy as its part of my job description around here rbN and nbsp( 
 well thats me done i think any more fars you need help with just send a message its a nice change from the fac fandangos rbN and nbsp( 
 thanks for asking for my help but i dont know about the subject and have no experience in fa reviews best of luck in your endeavours 
 kappa please stop if you continue i am going to ask another admin to block you 
 please stop indeed i find that mass posting to be disruptive please find some other venue of dealing with this issue 
 what do you suggest 
 two things vote stacking gains nothing an appeal for help is one thing if you know that the editor in question has a history of supporting the topic in question secondly i am willing to take a look at it could you give me a link of an old version that i can take a look at to determine its notability 
 i dont quite know what to suggest but massposting is not the way to go no matter how strongly you feel about the issue thanks 
 i have listed this issue at 
 people have the right to be informed before they get stabbed in the back not after 
 following policy is not stabbing people in the back also see my comment below 
 not informing people that policy is suddenly disenfranchising them is stabbing them in the back 
 i believe that you were warned at N utc on the N th and that at N utc on the N th you stated that you were going to knowingly violate policy since your message above was immediately before you began your second wave 
 informing editors about their potential loss of voice in wikipedia discussions is not a violation of any reasonable interpretation of policy 
 my misunderstanding since your comment immediately followed mine i assumed that you were saying that my listing of the issue at an or i was a stab in your back my response to you was therefore my explaination of why i felt my actions were not as so characterized obviously i did not understand you correctly and your clarification renders my response of N sepN moot 
 or alignleft widthN per cent or thank you for your beautiful words and warm wishes on my birthday dear mousey i took a welldeserved oneday wikibreak and spent it with my family and my friends and actually had a beer after months of forced abstinence of course theres no way id forget about you so i saved a great tasty piece of chocolate cake just for you but sorry no beer left again thank you so much for taking the time to wish me well and have a wonderful day my friend love 
 ps i love your user name lol 
 replied on your talk page 
 hi i notice that you mention that videmus omnia is new and people shouldnt be harsh on him hes not new he put up a delete bot in the first hours of membership and in the last week hes rfcd two administrators as well as putting renner up for coi blp and deleting the amy photo and article he also deleted all the pictures of four people with whom he had a minor difference of opinion there are two open anis on him if hes new its not a good start but hes not new also he claims to have changed names to protect his privacy but his user talk page has a whole new identity with pictures of his wife etc hes supposed to be a military guy but he edits N or N anyways im new too but not new my old account edited too much of certain areas which i have a lot to do with and i gave out tmi on my talk page and someone in real life idd me so i quit wikipedia for a while and rejoined i might have to change names after durova has accused me of being a sock or whatever she rfcued me for being alkivar i had gone over and made a report of vos multiple attacks on N people and she assumed i was a spa which im not i only found out about the alkivar case due to the vo thing on james r but whatever thats what you get when you take a stand here anyways vos behavior actually is relevant to the afd because it is part of a larger pattern of disruptions and for a N week stay on wikipedia it is quite impressive 
 you are right i did misunderstand you thats great that he is good at uploading images and deleting unfree ones the problem seems to be with anyone who disagrees with his image decisions and that included in this case renner given that this is a pattern it does have bearing i feel on the article afd vos skill doesnt allow him to attack people who disagree with him and that the topic of his two anis two days ago he deleted all or most images of some people he had a minor dispute with and also put up for afd most of rennerrelated things anyways this isnt a good case for gfdl obtention for a little dead girl gfdl would render her picture open to misuse gfdl is good for beyonce or britney they can be reused in various contexts not this my N cents 
 hi id love to trot over for a look i have been insanely busy in real life in the last couple of months but i may have a moment tomorrow and or or wednesday when i can stop being a headless chicken for a bit 
 ok i will have a look in the near future for what its worth my 
 thank you very much 
 seconded and also thanks for i cant believe i forgot to do that cheers 
 any suggestions on what adminspecific readings i should be starting to go through and what order eg the actual mechanics of how to do some of the adminrelated stuff 
 that looks like a lot but dont panic you are not required to know everything at once or do everything at once one of the most important things to remember is that there are N other administrators all by definition more experienced than you so if you arent sure about something dont do it if it is really important and really needs to be done someone else will cover for you again if in doubt dont there is usually plenty to do at the backlog categories that is useful absolutely obvious and not controversial for a while stick to that you will know when and if you feel comfortable to do the more controversial stuff if you never do thats fine too the noncontroversial work is no less useful to get done feel free to ask questions though me or someone else or wpan or wpan or i 
 oh one of the fun things you can start with is picking the little template for the corner of your user page its a good idea to mark yourself as a wielder of the mop the options are at 
 you may want to use edit summaries while archiving i know edit summaries are a pain in the ass but still 
 i use edit summaries >N per cent of the time if i missed one it was almost certainly an accident which archiving are you referring to exactly 
 oh dont be alarmed 
 you might want to take a look at i havent read it through yet but it looks useful 
 hi kulystab this site has been mentioned before on the hiwwi talk page however we had a few problems with it first of all we dont know how the site itself is reliable the index page doesnt exist and as far as i can find there is no about us page that describes the site second how do they have permission to post these magazines and stuff although it is doubtful that any of them are still under copyright that is possible third most of the magazines themselves are contemporary publications that were meant to arouse patriotism in the population of whatever country they were being published in there is a good chance that not all of the info is actually factual and that a lot of the exploits described havent had a bit of hyperbole added to them to make them sound better and more heroic thanks for pointing this site out to me but at this point its not one that i want to use in an article that will i hope soon be going to fac 
 welcome dana if you ever need any help drop a note on my talk one thing you might be aware of is that gimmetrow runs the bot on tuesdays and saturdays and prefers that we archive on those days let me know if you have any questions id love to see far get back to a higher save percentages and pinging people in to work in their specialty areas might help have fun 
 thank you for both the welcome and the offer of assistance if needed sandy i will keep gimmetrows archiving schedule in mind and make a special effort to archive on those days i have been attempting to ping people about some articles that are at far and i want to make this even more of a priority 
 well done i was expecting some dramatic drumroll or unveiling on a catwalk or something 
 thanks ym for my part i was for some reason expecting it to be slightly more painful perhaps something to do with sandys comment about raul putting it up for community consensus that thought scared me for a while 
 i think tony has gone soft and has been overtaken in the reviewing stakes for high standards by the new crop p i was rather surprised by his stance wonder what malleus will come up with if he comes 
 how would i go about asking someone on say imdbcom to release pictures of actors onto wikipedia pictures i would assume they took for example i notice there is no picture of 
 the apathy on the two australian fars is a bit depressing with the article fixup that is the two fars you just pinged tony for im still wondering if malleus will respond maybe a second nag will work 
 reminder dont forget to update the counts cheers 
 im sorry on behalf of my semiretirement feel free to sign your name under the signatures section its been very pleasant working with you good luck to you 
 done that sorry to see you go 
 well now i switched retirement positions and i am now officially retired good luck to your future editing 
 good luck to you too 
 are you thinking of closing biman and dalek soon i was thinking about it and didnt want a edit conflict or anything since the result may not be obvious 
 also dont forget to add the review commentary subheading when sectioning thanks 
 chin up getting a right decision is the main thing and you are doing fine 
 since you didnt seem to know one of the first steps of deleting an article is putting in a tag so people are given the time to put in N rd party nontrivial rss for the article jumping straight to an afd notice is generally not a good idea 
 i seriously doubt that 
 my personal preference is to speedy delete the article fully protect it blank ban the creator afd all articles they ever edited use checkuser tools to find their ip address hack into their computer and insert a virus so that any attempt by them to even look at wikipedia redirects them to citizendium you just cant be too careful 
 i have withdrawn and apologize for the inconvenience 
 i have been through the article now as you asked and i think it looks pretty good best of luck at fac 
 see uN 
 im not so sure about this being an easy keep per your comment to ed the content looks rather odd and the vietnam section raised a few red flags for me but it would be good to get people who follow us politics closely in general i just think the layman reviewer is too reluctant to question anything at all about the content across all review processes 
 ok i think i have covered the diff and will copy and paste this onto the article talk page it looks like most of the things the newer contributor is trying to put in are reasonably cited uncontroversial or both unfortunately they are not necessarily enough for 
 fyi i exchanged a few emails with ms cummings about a better image for the article im afraid that despite much pleading and begging on my part she was only willing to give permission for wikipedia only sorry i had a similar problem with 
 thanks if even you cant get them by the way your impressive accomplishements have inspired me quite a bit now i send out a new image request almost every day i know you probably send out one every hour but still 
 dana this article is part of a student project and she has been unable to get feedback from the project on it any good pointers you can give her will be appreciated 
 i dont know about fac but if encouraged she might shes done a good job initially she started on a different article but got a lot of flak on it so switched to this one it could be an interesting fac article but it needs a lot of work before then 
 with regards to the 
 yes i am opposed i dont think there is enough individual content in the article its basically a history of the victoria cross in general and not of the victoria cross for new zealand specifically i dont believe a featured article should be basically a copy of another article that doesnt mean its bad its still an interesting story that just means its unoriginal compare say 
 dont get me wrong i understand your point of view they need to be separate article but given the close nature of the two awards there is bound to be an overlap the victoria cross for new zealand has an identical history to the vc it is the same medal made out of the same historic metal yet it is only in the last decade that it has differed given the limited time scale of the medal it is hard nay impossible to have a separate history they are so closely intertwined does the article itself on its own warrant fa status the debate has to be on the quality of the article itself and if it follows the fa criteria i think it is an faworthy article 
 ah you want chapter and verse ok it fails 
 thankyou given this suggestion would you prefer it if it were moved to victoria cross and then all vcs given to new zealanders could be discussed the focus of the article woudl become new zealanders who won the victoria cross and then the vc for new zealand would be a section at the end would that be satisfactory 
 possibly but i am not that worried about the title im worried about the content i believe the content that is mostly about the victoria cross in general should be at most summarized here the most dramatic example is probably the appearance section that starts the victoria cross for new zealand is identical to the original design everything beyond that one sentence is better and more appropriately covered in the 
 if you then reexpand it with more details on the new zealanders who received the vc focusing on the way they received it that would be fine and if its well done id be happy to support 
 i noticed the comment you left for plotfeat at the far i have raised some more farworthy points about the articles content at the far in case you havent seen it yet ten pound hammer his otters and a cluebat uN (
 i saw your comments as i told plotfeat im planning on letting both fars run their course my main point to him was to limit his number of nominations and perhaps raise the concerns on the talk page first 
 dana on dont forget to remove them from 
 oh shoot i forgot completely im really sorry about that ( 
 not to worry plenty of people watch our backs mine too 
 are you going to do them you might have thought i did i want to go to sleep 
 dana i went ahead and did them lest they be forgotten 
 thank you for the congrats and belated support regards
 think nothing of it like i said if i had known that you were running for your adminship you would have had my support all the way you know becoming an admin is one of my biggest goals on wikipedia or or 
 im not sure whats going on with the rapidfire speedy nominations but thanks for looking into it oh fyi i just got a release on about N goodquality images of adult film stars from flickr user anime nut should be starting upload soon 
 i just noticed it too and reported it at 
 do you still have a copy of the original blank philippine map in detail i noticed they have since deleted it 
 thanks for the immediate response and for the offer too its very tempting i just somehow feel its not yet time its too much of a responsibility that i can handle 
 tc can you brief me a bit more on the admin tools that you currently utilize id like to analyze them and see how much difference it would be to have these tools im currently ontraining mode prepping for rfa thanks 
 ooh hey thats really cool sure feel free to use it however you like a free print would be appreciated if its not too much trouble how can i contact you to give more information 
 hi if you find the time for it please review 
 i can now reveal that oba chandler today became a good article 
 thanks will see what i can do 
 the 
 same here might need to be brought up at 
 i did get it to load but its ultra slow also dana id think youd know by now that i know to notify others of fars ten pound hammer his otters and a cluebat uN (
 i also got it to load by going to the article talk page clicking on the wp and then clicking on its talk page 
 tph you didnt list the notifications correctly on the far others need to see the links to the talk pages where the fars were notified so they can be verified you should include direct links to the listings of the far messages on wp and user talk pages at the top of the far i used to check all of these and have stopped doing it so perhaps procedures have slipped but just saying wikiprojects notified isnt helpful and you should link to the user talk page where the notification is made not the user page 
 i used to check and do all of these myself we need to be able to click on the link go to the talk page and verify that notifications are done correctly 
 i agree that all of the projects and users notified should be listed as sg says this makes it much easier for delegates and other users to double check that notifications have been made 
 what did i do wrong how should i have fixed it did i ask for help in the right place 
 respectively you are quite welcome comes with 
 i am peering at my screen and yes yes i think your ears do look awfully pink from here that wouldnt be 
 hi david hope you dont mind but i jumped in on a request you were handling 
 no problem had only looked at the site not the requestor a useful learning point 
 i have seen your name in a few places i just want to say that i find that you are what an editor should be i have seen that you always take good faith on principle especially towards newbies that might not always know the rules i just wanted to say thanks for being here because i know that being an admin you probably get a lot of flak anyway i think you make wikipedia a postive place 
 thank you thank you 
 dana i apologize for not having given you better guidance at far you are doing great i guess you can probably detect that going to far these days just depresses the hell out of me and with the backlog at fac and reviewers lacking everywhere depressing wiki pages are not what i need more of im glad to see sv popping in to try to help out and sorry that the page has trended so far away from marskells very good management where it was rare for fars to drag on so long and article improvement was the norm i have a very full day and will be out most of the day but soon i will put here for you a list of the things i used to do as backup for marskell so that he could stay out of the minutia and hopefully you will be able to locate an active far participant who will do similar things to help you out i will get back to you and i apologize again for not having been more help 
 thanks sandy i look forward to reading the list and any other guidance that you may have please also feel free to email me if you wish although i know that you usually like to keep wiki stuff onwiki 
 if you want to see some of the most surprising pics i have ever gotten by email based on 
 lordy wow i wonder if some of those could be used for other articles and no not the ones you think we have got plenty of explicit photos in those articles instead 
 added to surfboard wax down a bit in the page and also to the female skateboarders spot as for the more explicit ones umm no 
 yeah i agree on that 
 i hope this means not one nom at a time period but instead one nom at a time in the farc section and another in the top section as you had supported earlier sound good thank you for your time 
 i really really think we should allow at least one in each section and just leave it at that makes things a bit simpler as far as operation we are already changing things by stricter enforcement etc etc thank you 
 as i said on the far page i think it should depend on the backlog that would prod reviewers and editors into doing more to get articles moved through the process more quickly however before i comment more i am going to wait and see what the disussion seems to be on the far page as this really goes by community consensus not what my personal feelings are 
 i just took care of it thanks for letting me know it wouldnt have got unstuck until i got around to noticing the problem 
 regarding incident he has returned as 
 blocked 
 so anonemouse how being admin working out for ya good pay huh helps support the fam and pay off the car aye 
 more seriously look frightner or whoever you are if you make this into a continued war between yourself and mr neutron it benefits no one you are quite right that we cant predict the next ip you will choose so why not use the opportunity to make edits that wont be seen as part of a useless edit war surely there are plenty of articles in your chosen area that could use actual improvement not just backandforth reversion when you joined wikipedia was it really just to get back at someone wasnt it to write a free encyclopedia to write and improve articles that millions or eventually billions of people around the world would read enjoy and learn from please remember that and come back to that this isnt a chat room this isnt a video game its a collaborative project to make the world just a little bit better please help or at least dont harm that starryeyed idea 
 i joined wikipedia to contribute fairly with an honest and neutral pov until mr neutron and several of his bulgarian comrades if you will turned macedonian related articles into a bunch of senseless propaganda as with the 
 dana i just realized malleus entered two delist declarations there 
 im sorry but where would the second one be i see one by malleus about half way in and then another one by cirt at the bottom that cites malleus reasons am i missing something 
 you are right it was cirts mention of malleus that i misread as signed by malleus whew 
 thanks for adding that pmc support to 
 entirely agree if but can get some consensus to do this i will happily code 
 dana before i give the examples of what sections or parts in the article that needs fixing i need to know if 
 yes i will it will be a bit of work but i will work on it and fix those problems sincerely 
 well i posted my comments also i got your message after i posted it however i dont think i was too nitpicky 
 i actually do have a question that last section of the article concerning mods really has little to no references as i have been searching over the internet i really believe that section is a lost cause is there anyway to simply remove that section the rest of the article personally looks to be shaping up and i think i will be finished with it at the end of the week sincerely 
 well i doubt this will help but i was on an extended 
 ok can we pick one issue at a time and try to work through it i havent edited many or possibly any macedonian or bulgarian or greek articles so i hope i dont have any particular point of view can you point to one disputed issue and we will talk it through ok meanwhile try not to make any controversial edits with this ip at least so we will know who you are for a while at least i will drop a quick note on your talk page and in your block log so hopefully you wont get blocked until then 
 ok thats fine i will not make any controversial edits or edits categorized as vandalism or trolling but as i have mentioned earlier the reason my edits result in bans is because mr neutron has some sort of campaign against me where he involves 
 yes now your edits are being reverted on principle but presumably the initial conflict didnt come out of nowhere did it i blocked that earlier string of ips because each made some nasty comment or blanked a users talk page or something what is the underlying issue we need to resolve to keep you folks from fighting i know there are probably several but lets pick one or two asee if we can resolve those then use them as a model for the others 
 well the main issue is 
 # i see 
 # 
 # finally i suspect 
 option one is fair and well observed it clearly shows that certain contributors have altered the text or taken it out of context such as stating most of the population rather than the bulgarian population this point will be discussed further on the articles talk page secondly the correct article was 
 now has that made you resolve never to ask again i would have told me where to go about three days ago 
 hi in edit you include the logo for the N version of the game in an article about the N version of the game using an edit summary that suggests that you rolled back the edit clearly the removal of that logo is not vandalism as firstly the logo is plainly wrong secondly the nonfree logo did not have a fairuse rationale something that is required per our 
 i saw you repaired the article further thanks 
 i mistook that the image was for only the one year i am doing my edits one by one even in that edit his edit was suboptimal as he left the caption in place 
 this is mostly true but not completely true i know of a case where it isnt i only know because some of those bad people have briefly crossed editing paths with me i only edited a question on a talk page about a peripheral issue 
 yes but one case should not be the reason to completely change an entire process perhaps you should get more involved in the fa and far processes to see how much work actually goes into these and how the editing environment in generally collegial featured articles do have conflicts just like any other article on wp and it sounds like you had a bad experience on the talk page of a featured article rather than on a fac or far page specifically there is really no such thing as bad people here on wikipedia simply people with differing opinions you seem to be mainly discussing one article in your examples although you wont name that article specifically as i said on the talk page if you dont want to name the article in the wp space send an email to an editor that you trust or one of the fac or far delegates detailing your concerns about the article or just go ahead and nominate it for far yourself there is nothing that people on wikipedia can do to you other than type loudly 
 thanks for your invitation to get involved in fas i will accept i transformed a stub to an article to ga almost single handedly i would like to make it fa i will first just make limited comments about other fac then when i have sufficient experience will make more substantial comments then make my article an fa thanks for the encouragement 
 please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the 
 i have deproddedbe prepared to defend if it reaches afd or consider merging 
 good luck with the wwi piece if you need backup holler otherwise i will just lurk and make minor tweaks 
 i think that dana makes her own luck as far as fac is concerned how many editors were invited to comment on every aspect of the article before its nomination how much better prepared could it be 
 thanks you two malleus i really try to invite as many editors as possible just because i hate being stressed during the fac process i would have been tearing my hair out at yomans list of issues if they had come up during the fac but since i had all the time in the world to work on them before the fac it was really no big deal same with the image issues i really appreciate all of the reviewers who put time into it beforehand theres no way i could do it without all of you 
 i agree that its a lot easier to deal with the inevitable when there isnt a time crunch to get things done its a good lesson for all of us 
 hi there you were listed on the 
 well some peer review as above makes a big difference some topics are bound to be controversial but as i have said earlier no amount of npov will make a case for the earth being flat 
 you mean the earths not flat i will add the article to my watchlist but i dont know if i will actually contribute because i have a bad tendency to spread myself too thinly and to get distracted btw if you want to contact me or other users you might consider leaving responses on their respective talk pages keep up the good work 
 no problem everyone here was a new user at one point if you have any more questions i would be happy to help 
 thanks for volunteering to help with that good article student assignment project this is just the heads up that students have begun to work on the article the aim is to have the article ready for gan by june N feel free to wait till then but also feel free to comment on their progress and offer suggestions before that date 
 noted thanks 
 i worked on the islam article a bit 
 thank you very much doug 
 and rightfully deserved way to go 
 sorry for the immediate hassle but jingiby is willing to engage in an edit war i have cleaned up the article nicely but every change i make to his edits even for the benefit of the article he reverts if you look at the article history you will see that i undid one of his revisions and i continued to contribute rather than undoing my revision he has reverted all my edits to his last version i do not want to engage in an edit war because he is the one starting them i hope you can find the time to look into the situation thanks 
 i think you are setting a dangerous precedent for someone making death treats to just get away with it 
 it was not a threat it was an assertion i will kill you is a threat death to is not 
 look at what hes doing again pov edit warring and trolling comments another nice example 
 sigh thats not acceptable i have given up any idea of unblocking frightner and will semiprotect the articles involved for a limited time renewed as necessary if the vandalism comes back please drop me a note or send me an email if he seems to be vandalizing other articles or user pages and i will semiprotect those as well ( a shame 
 semiprotecting might help for some time its indeed shame because this user prior to late july had a long history of good contributions and it all went downhill from then i will be letting you know about possible sockpuppets 
 annoyingly the fac has closed while i was reviewing it but one comment i was going to make there how confident are you for cavalry fired the first shots of the war for britain history books generally name 
 although im happy the fac was closed its too bad you werent allowed to complete your review i always welcome more comment on the article as far as your comment above goes i have removed that partial sentence it was supposed to be showing that cavalry was there from the beginning to the end of the war and was a summary of the statement above that clarified that it was the first shot in france after a second look however it was actually rather redundant and so i have removed it i would love to hear any further comments you have on the article either here or on the articles talk page 
 and hooray for one heckuva accomplishment this was one tough row to hoe for you mega congrats i hope you are popping the cork of your favorite beverage to celebrate this fa kudos 
 nice work dana 
 thanks guys the fac was actually quite a bit easier than i thought it would be i kept expecting someone to find some aspect that i had missed completely or ask me to rewrite the entire article or something yay now on to another horse breed or something 
 and in the meantime thanks for weighing in on the little capitalization war sigh 
 or 
 take a look at and compare to the picture in the 
 it does look like him to me and mdash 
 yes the hair is slightly different and he put on a bit of weight before N but i think so too obviously he didnt notice the camera or he would have turned invisible so now we have a free picture of chotiner for his article and we can lose the life magazine one 
 for the info box he is rather in the background isnt he also in the 
 i guess the campaign shot is not that good for chotiner i will include it in the article though i have a better one of nixon but need to upload it 
 hi dana i added more of the gas and fas to the horses portal hope i did it right and that there arent getting to be too many random selections i had a question on the dyk section though what does seedN mean in 
 i have yet to figure out what seed means i have read the documentation on it multiple times but it just keeps flying over my head i wont remove them now but dont be suprised if a bot removes the pictures from easy jet etc they are fair use and they were bot removed as nonnecessary the last time i added them maybe they will stick this time 
 yeah they did oh well who are we to question the wikigods so the seed thing doesnt limit the rotation to only five dyks does it 
 no i dont think it limits it to only five because i have seen way more than that on there at some point i will have to find the editor who wrote the documentation for that little thing and ask them what exactly it does 
 an rfc has been requested for the alice bailey article which is listed as a part of wikiproject biography the only person who has showed up is from wikiproject occult and in my view is not a neutral observer i am not familiar with how an rfc is supposed to work but the situation is a mess and spinning out of control if someone from wikiproject biography could take a look and make some suggestions i think it might be helpful thank you 
 now that the bookkeeping is done i need to actually read the material hold on 
 thanks sethie just when i always begin to feel hopeless some unseen force pulls together on wiki and reason appears i will work on finding diffs over the next few days renee 
 btw i am in awe of the work you are doing on the bhrama kumaris article and the work you are trying to do the alice bailey article finding those sources wowsa most of them are probably not scholarly N ndary sources but the fact that you went and looked wow 
 on the portal would give you four copies of the same dyk fact whereas if each of the above had a different seed you would get four different dyks hope this helps 
 so pda can you verify that we have the dyks working right in the portal it seemed to me that the rotation with several reloads did seem to keep bringing up the same oneswe now have about N sets of four we can rotatei know squat about using this stuff and would it mess up anything to toss the seed parameter it isnt on the other random subpage generators 
 yes the dyks are working fine and all subpages are eligible to appear no it wouldnt mess up anything to toss the seed parameter (if you wanted to check the effects without editing the portal you could paste into the box on 
 it appears that the archives have been vandalized the information that i had put there documenting that jamesdN had linked the article to his booksellers website has been removed it now starts with sethies reply to my information the links he added and later removed after my protest can be seen at 
 folks and by this i mean both kwork and renee and whoever else please dont make this personal this should be about 
 the article was nominated ping as requested 
 hi let me piggyback on this your voice is needed at 
 anonemouse you could not have possibly misunderstand me more than you have i do not have any personal animosity against any of the other editors i understand that they are trying to achieve something that they think very important and which is close to their hearts the problem as i see it is their use of unfair tactics which is harmful to the article and harmful to wikipedia my own understanding is that wikipedia can not function as it was intended unless the editors are willing at some point to compromise let me know if you think i am wrong about that 
 compromise is good no argument since most of the criticism section has been approved to stay it seems some level of compromise has been achieved no 
 ps you received these suggestions because your name was listed on 
 no kidding the only thing i can think of is my edits to ship articles when i review them for ga but things over water and things on the water are two very different categories 
 it is my hope that there is now a sense of compromise and that the argument is over but some of what i read on todays talk page makes me doubt that all editors see it quite that way it is my guess that unless something can be done to protect the criticism section the fight will go on forever 
 lets please focus on the article has anyone read the encyclopedia entry 
 hi dana will you peek at 
 and its now up in wiki mainspace comments still welcome 
 anyways please drop me a note what to do when archiving w or a rfc thanks 
 it looks like you have found 
 i agree with closing how to do it have you done it the second rfc was on there somewhere rfc or user kwork lol at the dancing elephant btw that is one of the most convoluted talk pages i have ever seen nobody seems able to follow interlineated text and have a real discussion always have to be reraising points from scratch sigh anyways thanks for your comments and i believe thanks for archiving the page since i have been taking a wikibroke myself 
 thanks sethie just when i always begin to feel hopeless some unseen force pulls together on wiki and reason appears i will work on finding diffs over the next few days renee 
 btw i am in awe of the work you are doing on the bhrama kumaris article and the work you are trying to do the alice bailey article finding those sources wowsa most of them are probably not scholarly N ndary sources but the fact that you went and looked wow 
 i havent moved the article but it looks to me like should be moved 
 moved that thanks for pointing that out 
 thank you for keeping the review open this long we were trying to put together a template to ease citing technical specifications of legacy models that fizzled and the far followed i will try to revive activity and see if we can make some headway in the next few days if not we can close and delist 
 i have switched over to which appears to be the best solution for legacy models i am ready as always to cite or remove any specific unsourced material you can point to 
 fyi i responded to an far subpage comment you made here you can close the page 
 i like to get at least a couple of editors input before closing hence the reason i asked the editor to ping some of the biology editors that are active at fac also would you please expand on your previous comments at the 
 okay thanks and also cheers 
 dana the editors who could best look at that are and im sorry i dont have time to help with the pingiepingie 
 thanks sandy i have spammed the talk pages of those four so hopefully the review page will get some more comments before the next round of closings this weekend 
 you really made me do a lot of work on the 
 all done i went and rephrased the hispanic terminology in accordance with the reference that you provided thanks for pointing out all of these things it really needed a lot of copyediting 
 changing to support adding a few tweaks of my own but if you dont like them change them back my support doesnt depend on them good luck 
 anonemouse i would like to sincerely thank you not so much for your support of the fac but becuase you your really went to a lot of trouble of pointing out each of the things that needed to be fixed you truly set an example of what is expected of a well mannered and civil person in wikipedia it is funny the only thing that had me stumped was the definition of the term hispanic but when i realized that the us government who created the term was also confused i told myself i will go with the source provided by anonemouse it has been a pleasure interacting with you 
 yes thank you for doing a major amount of work on the article enabling it to reach fa status legitimately from my point of view it was important to the community at large that this article be accorded due respect thank you for doing that regards 
 hi i protected this page 
 have the page watchlisted now if more reverts take place i will fully protect uN 
 i think it meets something yes 
 dana i emailed you 
 replied apologies for the delay 
 the list is ready for you they are pushing me at the newsroom 
 dana could you let me know if you cant do it in the next six or eight hours please the whole publication is ready and waiting 
 ps 
 dana this is a real mess i had no idea youd be offline all this time i have had to ask someone else to do it without knowing whether he is online and willing please email me when you come online 
 you might want to take a look at what has transpired in the past two days 
 fiasco fiasco is replacing the whole section or article with fred is gay and even that can be easily reverted you mean thats minor shading differences in a few sentences nothing to go running to an administrator over you are all grown ups surely you can work it out especially if you dont spend as much effort on calling each other names im not casting the article section in concrete the way i saw it was fine but not perfect similarly this is roughly equivalent and not perfect for example specifying that sjoo is an advocate of the goddess movement is probably an improvement specifying that gershoms essay is selfpublished is debatable repetition of the word article is clearly wrong some steps forward some steps back by working on it together you can make it better by fighting over it you cant but in any case please do try to see the whole thing in a bit of perspective the exact phrasing of a few sentences in one section of one article is just not 
 but that is not what i meant rather i was considering the argument raging on the talk page much of it aimed at building a basis for removing all mention of baileys antisemitism i would call it a fiasco but if you are happy with it as they say in italian beata te 
 sigh will read much as i dont want to frankly the article talk page is huge a hundred times the length of the actual article itself and not very organized keeping up with it is nearly impossible 
 hi nhrhs though i supported deletion of this template i appreciate that you were thinking of creative ways to make admin chores easier it wasnt a bad idea in theory 
 not a problem i also supported deletion as just delete it per above thanks for stopping by my talk page 
 honestly i have given up trying to read it all myself i really feel tired of the whole thing but hate to give up on what i have started 
 i skimmed it i couldnt find anyone asking to remove the whole criticism section merely for tightening some of the language which is fine i found someone objecting to the the world love quote by gershom of bailey and found it in problems of humanity chapter iv if you see anyone removing the whole section feel free to come to me but even on the talk page i dont see that if you see that please point me to where anyone says that 
 uN dana now its my turn to apologise after last weeks tsunami of N promotions this week the cupboard is bare having asked brianboulton to do the honours we have had to postpone his involvement until next week i presume it will be ok if we also postpone your involvement to N august ie the monday week deadline by then the window for choosing will have settled at saturday to friday utc so you will have saturday to decide and write your para since we will need to tweak the page on the basis of your choice saturday night your time would be good thanks 
 sounds good thanks for the heads up 
 the intent is there as i read it but i will not bother you with a lot of extra text to read now because there is hope to get beyond that the return of your presence in the discussion has been been very helpful 
 in my case at least kwork reads it wrong i would be happy to see the section expanded if need be but that is not what i came here for rather since you prolly missed it in that convoluted talk page thanks a bunch for finding the source of gershoms quote that really helps having said that i agree with your assessment above about the talk page any suggestions on dealing with that problem other than just archiving it i mean i suppose its unavoidable but i wouldnt mind trying 
 whats up 
 heh real life has been keeping me insanely busy i have been keeping an eye on everything wiki but have had little to no time to contribute much to my dismay i should get back into the full swing of things in late fall or early winter but will keep checking in until then please ping me if there is anything urgent that needs my attention at far i have do check my messages and watchlist once or twice a day and far every few days but i may miss something thanks for taking up the slack in the meantime and sorry for leaving much of the pinging and begging for reviews to you for the moment 
 nine months of winter and three months of too busy for words its like that where i am only we call it nine months of winter and three months of tourists lol 
 its exactly like that here work farming and wedding planning leave very little time for wikiing 
 anonemouse was the editor without a user name blocked from editing the article at your request 
 no all i know about that is what i get from skimming the talk page and frankly as per my recommendation to focus on the article not the editors i havent been paying much attention to it but since you ask lets look into the details according to the alice bailey was semiprotected on aug N by 
 thanks for checking if i understand correctly she is only blocked because the page is semiprotected and she does not have a user name that can be recognized is that correct 
 yes 
 hello jaga i am brazilian and i need of you to correct my translation edits because you are from an english speakingcountry please help me in the 
 i will be glad to take a stab at it i will work on articles as i get the chance thanks for the note 
 dana its the coming week and we should have the list complete on the sp page with links by friday utc the window is last saturday to next friday there will be a prepared space for your choice and reasons saturday is the best day to do this although if you are superbusy on the weekend late friday is fine if you can see nothing much more will be promoted by midnight utc i will email you a reminder on friday thanks 
 sounds good tony i will keep an eye on the promotions this week and try to get it done last thing friday night or first thing saturday morning 
 thank you indeed dana 
 dana 
 you misunderstand but to explain i would have to explain stoic philosophy and this is not the place for that to put it simply a basis of stoicism is no person has the power to control another persons choices unlike to some other editors and who i regard as meatpuppets her editing is rational according to sethie i can not be trusted so maybe you should block me too that would make some editors who oppose me very happy 
 actually i say we keep the page semiprotected until anonip agress to sign his or her name see here 
 there is a lot to be said for getting a user account no argument 
 i have filed a request to extend the semiprotect 
 hello are you aware you voted twice was it a mistake or something cheers
 oops 
 there is an error in the image 
 weird i cant tell where this is coming from it doesnt appear when viewing the file in a browser something must be different about wikipedias renderer 
 thanks for your support in 
 all the best tone with the seminar i am also a physics student and the same thing will probably happen to me sometimes over the next few years 
 good to hear that things are going well 
 thanks for the welcome note 
 no dissing blonds allowed at far however perhaps enrico fermi was a 
 are you interested in 
 darn i have been thinking of asking her myself yes dana you should definitely run 
 hi secret and courcelles thank you for your interest i am honored by the faith it shows in me i have considered running in an rfa however i dont really want to selfnominate it just doesnt seem like me for some reason also if someone else does nominate me i would like it to be someone that i have worked with in the past so that they have a more personal picture of me to present to potential voters since i have such stringent criteria for my own nomination im fairly sure it will be a while before i run thank you again though for your interest 
 well i would nominate you but our only interaction was back with the horses in wwi ga or acr rfa is fairly laidback lately not that youd need it but the tendency not to play twenty questions with qualified candidates is nice 
 rfa is very fickle and it can be very bruising dont do it 
 tis fickle but we need more admins do it 
 why not you have been around a while write content know your stuff and act normal what more does wiki want 
 twenty letters of reference including hand written letters from hm queen elizabeth ii and hh pope benedict xvi exceptions will be liberally granted however 
 to my most trusted and wellbelovxeN d danaboomer etc etc signed lizN 
 it apparently doesnt say much about my memory that i didnt remember working with you on hiwwi courcelles if you have had a name change though that might be partially to blame those always tend to catch me by surprise fainites i dont know if you meant that to be humerous but i laughed out loud when i read act normal since most of my rl friends or family think that regularly editing wiki is the very definition of not acting normal i still dont like the idea of nominating myself though courcelles despite the insult that i have offered by not remembering you would you offer still be open its working on content creation or review processes and the like that i was getting at in my earlier post and it seems like you are just the person if so do you like to have conoms or not if yes to that does anyone else offer fainite seems to already have found my letter from dearest lizzie 
 note i only said act normal my bid for conom would be a dip into a horse article and one tricky ga review im sure you can get a better offer though 
 id nominate ya but its a nasty thing to do to a friend lol take a look at the hammering cgoodwin got when nominated and see if you can run that gauntlet id say you have the right temperament (i dont id just want to hammer the assorted miscreants and pretty soon my talk page would look worse than 
 good idea links like this can help and best wishes 
 that still does not resolve the problem because there is a request to extend the protection of the article and that could be reinstated at any time that would in effect block her from editing again also you have done nothing to explain why you think it necessary that i should vouch for her or for that matter why she needs anyone to vouch for her do you have any comprehension how seriously jews take the issue of antisemitism jews have been treated viciously and jews have been murdered not just a few have been murdered but many not on just one occasion but many ocassions over many centuries this is not an issue to treat casually i think that in an effort to be nice i have not made this sufficiently clear 
 any article can be protected at any time in an encyclopedia where at any moment a bored ten year old can decide to replace an article with poopy jokes thats a given you dont have to do anything its a volunteer project finally you are close to 
 i would like you to show me how in any way godwins law applies to anything i said i have not accused anyone of being a nazi or compared anyone to hitler in fact i have been very careful to avoid making unfair accusations if you can show me where i have erred in that respect i will certainly apologize if you can not show me please avoid throwing godwins law at me as a simplistic solution to this complex problem in fact you effort to use godwins law as a convenient tool makes me doubt that you do understand how serious this discussion is 
 sorry but i think we are going off on a tangent this isnt a chat forum dedicated to exploring either your or my personal views and opinions this is a page dedicated to editing the wikipedia based on that i will withdraw the godwins law statement if that will make it easier if you have a specific request for something for me to do directly relevant to an encyclopedia article please ask 
 mouse i have been in email contact with this article subject who is complaining about the use of her real name in the article because weirdos see it at wikipedia and use it to stalk her i checked into it the information is sourced to an online syracuse student newspaper would you look into the situation and offer an opinion on whether anything can be done 
 side note that same newspaper reference is used in 
 also i want to emphasize that i am not questioning anyones good faith i completely understand the information was added to improve the encyclopedia in regards to the article subjects privacy this may be a case of trying to bolt the barn door after the horse has fled but im wondering if theres anything we can do 
 well there is precedent for removing it 
 it looks like it is the only reference on the article but it is only being used as a reference for her name she gave me some other information and references that i plan to use to reinforce the article also i advised her to contact the newspaper publisher to request that they redact her name from their online version because of the stalking problem if they have any humanity hopefully they will do so but im thinking that perhaps we should remove it regardless of what they do as i dont believe our articles should cause people problems in real life 
 i gather you two are leaning towards removal the article doesnt really hinge on the presence of the name and shes not charles manson but im rather not use 
 i will have to lean towards removal as well the issue is wikipedias 
 im agreeing with mouse in that wifeys world is not a precedent which im comfortable with i mean how much time do we spend telling users we need a reliable source for it and no source no keep and when we do have such a source we cant keep the information to say it sticks in my craw would be an understatement it also imo leads to a nasty grey area take 
 with rfa nothing is ever certain but if you ran im sure you would pass of course if you would rather not go through such an intensely stressful week i can certainly sympathize with that 
 oh dont talk her out of it dana i have sent you an email 
 and replied although i dont know how coherant it is thanks 
 should the info be oversighted out 
 do we need to go that far why not remove the info and lock the article for a while to prevent immediate reinsertion like what happened to 
 i think you are right in that is probably the best solution im open to whatever consensus turns out to be im having a more complex problem with 
 you should definitely run if i can make it (and thanks very much for the support by the way 
 sent you another email 
 its live hope i didnt screw up any of the formatting 
 alive and kicking um you mean 
 yup that would be it guess i remembered to put the template at the top but didnt think to link it here 
 seems we have agreement this should of course be discussed on the article talk page not here on my talk page i removed it from the article left a comment to see the talk page and added most of our conversation from here to the talk page thats 
 by the way i didnt lock the article because i dont see any signs that there will be an issue with anyone rushing to put it back the only one who commented on the talk page about it being removed was well joe b and we just got agreement from him here in general my belief is that the fewer admin tools are used the better 
 and about cutler i suspect i would be a bit less charitable in other words keep the image we can make exceptions in the name of humanity where it seems like an exboyfriend let a name slip in an interview we can replace worse photos with better ones but we cant make article subjects take out perfectly reasonable free photos with no replacement just because they dont like them 
 actually ms blue provided the info without any preconditions she just asked in a nice way that we look into the name thing and explained her problems regarding ms cutler i got a bunch of new images from a nyc socialevent photographer that i work with and will look through them to see if i can find something a little more flattering thanks for all your help 
 oh yes and i will stop calling them a faction as of now i didnt know it was contentious or even mildly offensive 
 thanks the point is to focus on the content of the article arguing about an editors personal affiliations is even at best not helping the article 
 troll thanks 
 on the subject of the infoboxes is it really necessary for local club years and club appearances to be visible in the final article even when as in the vast majority of cases they arent filled in it doesnt look that good when this heading with a blank space is visible in almost all the gaa player articles 
 thanks for sorting that 
 by the way you dont seem to be our friend from perth who seems to have been responsible for most of the above please do consider getting a user account then you wont be confused with other ip users like the above mentioned vandal after a few days you will be able to edit mr neutrons talk page and other benefits 
 why are bulgarians allowed to use nationalist websites but macedonians are not allowed to use any macedonian website as it is propaganda 
 ah the friend from perth frightner i dont know what you are referring to and frankly not tremendously interested im quite disappointed in what you did over the weekend i thought you yourself wrote we were getting somewhere 
 you are welcome great to hear it 
 there was a brief edit war here and on commons last night with ms cutler vs several other editors on the article photos i finally got in touch with her by email she had even contacted the photographer a friend of hers asking him to attempt to revoke the gfdl license on the four photos involved ultimately she gave us a publicity headshot under free license and the controversial photos have been deleted on commons the other one which was formerly used on the article did have a verified license but was no longer used and in my opinion not worth jimbo getting a phone call about 
 incidentally i have found that im much more likely to get a good publicity photo if there happens to be a crappy photo on the article when i call the subjects attention to it not that i would ever be so sneaky as to intentionally put an ugly photo on an article 
 heh given luke fords selfprofessed camera of death small wonder you are getting so many starlets to contribute pics 
 and jimbo might yet get that call i see that as i was making that luke ford edit above the ip from which jessica was making the edit was blocked by mddN for N hours this despite no edits from that ip for about N hours 
 i left a note on 
 i am surprised that she was editing her own article i have spoken with jessica in person and i know that she was hesitant to do so because of the fear that someone would notice and sensationalize it ~ 
 i was communicating with her by email she was unhappy with the photo that was on the article and was removing it the issue was resolved when she provided us with the publicity shot currently on the article 
 sounds good then thanks for leaving me the message ~ 
 will do 
 thanks for the feedbak much appreciated 
 hi dana i checked the images and didnt find any issues the article does have a few images with some combination of the following no exif data low resolution and driveby uploader i dont see evidence these are copyvios but those attributes can sometimes be red flags you might just want to keep an eye out when or if you are perusing prerelated internet sites 
 ok thanks for the check as im browsing pre sites i will keep an eye out for duplicates of these photos just in case 
 as you asked i have had a look through and its perfectly understandable to me a horse ignoramus theres the usual mos or prose stuff of course but thats fairly easily dealt with 
 dont let malleus fool you hes secretly surfing all the equine articles and becoming an expert lol 
 fyi 
 if it is necessary couldnt it be done within the text 
 but without the dot wikipedia does st rather than st 
 well done mb should be an easy fix 
 have fun with the mop less time for building up content more time for deleting it away p uN 
 thank you everyone here for your congratulations 
 the article subject says we can select photos from i have got a couple of hers picked out but im wondering if 
 i scanned through the ones on the public side and the only uncaptioned photo where i recognized anyone was one where 
 thanks tabercil i will definitely grab those tomorrow and a couple of the other captioned ones it also looks like the vanessa blue article needs a purge of some unsourced information since she disputed the accuracy of some of it i will probably work on that tomorrow as well 
 i should add that she is still much amused by of the page which referred to her as a member of 
 way to go dana you passed with nary a neigh vote er i mean nay vote now get to work ++ 
 congratulations 
 congrats try on this shirt and see if it fits ~
 why thank you tom it is much appreciated errr was there a backlog of these to be awarded 
 yes we had not awarded these for almost a year 
 hi there i noticed that when you archived 
 oops cos im an idiot i wondered why there seemed overlap and N previous archives not yet linked to i obviously had both talk pages open and got myself confused easily untangled and i will do later today when i have a free moment oh the shame but thanks for picking up on this 
 lol thanks uN 
 ok discussion started at 
 hi can you check 
 looks good tony thanks 
 on behalf of the military history coordinator ix tranche 
 also congrats on becoming an administrator and ndash had i seen it i would have supported you 
 im very glad you are running 
 shows that the marine railway was not so much a branch as an extension might be useful if you write about the queenswater station 
 this is good to know but i have a feeling that im going to have to subscribe historic map works in order to get a closer look 
 what do you need a closer look at the main long beach station can be seen and the marine railway continues on 
 actually i cant see any of the stations on that map whether its long beach queenswater wreck lead or even the ones in island park it only zooms in so far for me i assume you have actually got an account with the website but yes i can see the long beach marine railway too 
 no i dont have an account im assuming that huge box south of the rail line is long beach station for the current purposes that should be enough but a better source would be needed to cite in an article 
 or styleverticalalign middle bordertop N px solid gray or i noticed that 
 yes absolutely thanks though im slightly bothered by the star in the background being rusty 
 cool im afraid my graphic designer skills are pretty limited so i just used the original barnstar as a model and threw xxx on top of it if anyone has a better base from which to work im happy to see the image replaced 
 ho thanks thats nice 
 if someone forcibly removed the copyright failing article anyway it would remove the conundrum of de facto being able to have any old photo for non fas where nobody uunderstands or checks 
 im sorry i dont really understand your comment i havent seen anything on the gliding farc about the article having copyright problems just the images and im not sure what removing bad images from fas would have to do with using other bad images in nonfas 
 dana i have had in the back of my mind for days to call your attention to something but havent had time to do the research so hope you gimmetrow and yellowmonkey can sort it gimme recently adjusted the count at 
 off the top of my head i really dont know as this isnt a situation that has come up since i became a delegate i will look into the history tomorrow though its getting late here 
 ok sorry to be so little help but look for gimmes adjustment and then you may need to confer among yourselves i just cant remember how we did it either (i think 
 and here i thought we were going to be discussing the real 
 nameless date stamp N N september N 
 anonemouse in connection with namelesss request could you also take a look at 
 please take a look at what is current on the talk page discussing violation of agreement accusations of hijacking the article etc 
 it seems to me that should qualify using her material as a source in the article thanks 
 it looks like a chat forum participation in a chat forum does not qualify her as an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable thirdparty publications thats the standard that needs to be met from 
 sandy it looks like what gimme did makes the most sense and the count just got mixed up someplace it also looks like 
 i see even though i never had time to sort it best 
 i suppose that there is nothing to be done about it but jamesdN just buried a direct question to him about compromise under a long discussion about alice baileys supposed religious views that belong on a bailey discussion forum not on this articles talk page does not wikipedia have some way to resolve editing situations in which editors refuse to compromise and end the arguing 
 no not really there are harsh measures that can be taken if the article is being edited disruptively or if editors are being outright rude to each other but we cant force intelligent adults to either change their minds or stop arguing we can only keep trying by persuasion it does usually work but one of the reasons it usually works is that people get tired see 
 one more very important thing to remember keeping this in perspective if you ever feel you are getting ulcers from this stop and work on 
 i am feeling virtually no stress from this dispute i wish it would be over so i could go on to other things but if it continues there is much to be learned from this also all life is a school 
 dana a couple thoughts on the pr take a look at the photos now in the haflinger cat at commons maybe one more image could be added and a couple of the head shots swapped out for body shots if licensing checks out it would be nice if we had a full body shot for the lead photo the head shot is nice but if the image 
 meh i have looked at most of them and although there are some decent ones theres not a full body shot that i really like the one that you linked above is ok but the horse is dirty and the halter doesnt really fit i love the haflinger mare and colt one except that the foal has diarrhea on its back legs the other foal one is cute do you think this would be better than the current fuzzy baby pic currently in the article the second stamp design is cool and i debated using it but wasnt sure if we wanted multiple stamp images in the article it would be great to have a nice full body shot for the lead photo but i cant find one that i really like i added in the vain horse one its pretty although i dont know how much it actually adds to the education value of the article it would be better if we had more of a description but its still a nice image i agree that there are more decent pictures on commons then there used to be but it still hasnt gotten to where i would wish oh well maybe someday in the future someone will get around to going to one of the shows and getting some nice photos 
 its a challenge isnt it heck i fully intended to try and drive a whole hour to hit the mt draft horse expo and it didnt happen i kind of favor body shots over head shots when it can be done maybe the baby photos could be swapped the other thought would be to kill two birds with one stone and replace the drawing stamp with the photo stamp which happens to have a cute baby i think vain horse is probably in the tyrolean alps at least it looks like them 
 why did you just a chunk without any real reason 
 dude i know all about or etc you dont have to tell me anything about that but what do you not understand about the list that it reflects the list above with the explanation where things a sourced and cited stop removing things just because 
 for the record i never blanked any page and the forum is full of explanations for my edits 
 thanks i understand you are all well meaning editors if only you believed that about each other 
 hey dana you might have a fast solution to two of the recentlytagged dead links in the arabian horse article the fei links to olympic champions went kapooie i need a link to th N olympics naming the horse harpagon as a medal winner in dressage also need a new link to the fei level wins of theodore oconnor im stuck on the dialup this weekend and just getting the appy rule book downloaded to update the appaloosa articles dead link just took me N minutes p p p if you havent the time i may get to it next week sometime 
 sticking my nose in the olympics i know try 
 webcite it if you can the two sites i know of that are actually reliable for pulling olympic results out of do not include information on the horses and the iocs database is even sketchy on them not to mention just being plain difficult to get anything out of 
 thanks courcelles i will do some more work on deadlinks later today including any that you two havent gotten to 
 i think the original footnote that harpagon was an anglo was from one of the angloarabian web sites that ealdgyth made us toss as not an ideal source in that big citation improvement push we did when under the impression that we might take the article to fa for now if we have a cite to harpagon by at the right olympics i will find the breeding info somewhere 
 i think i need your help and support i got an e mail from an editor asking me to look at the 
 so out of those there are no obvious deletes and a number of obvious keeps im actually rather surprised i know that even a halfhearted effort to find deletionworthy candidates in other pornography fields generally finds some are there others you are concerned about 
 i really appreciate both your time and patience in 
 you are welcome please let me know if or when there are other articles you would like extra eyes on im not the best copyeditor but i can usually find a few things to complain about good luck at gan 
 hi igor im not sure what you mean by seeing your biography page any registered user is allowed to create articles on wp you dont need an administrators help for that also articles are relatively rarely protected vandalism must be seen at a higher than normal level for an administrator to protect an article if you post your article please check to make sure that it meets the 
 at this point i dont think you should create an article on yourself or add your name to the 
 if large newspapers wrote full stories about you then you may have a case for an article i would suggest posting at a related wikiproject to see if there is someone interested in helping you create an article about yourself the 
 hi i would be happy to do the revision you outline needs to be done on this quote sorry i got carried away with the story of tammuz 
 hi roslyn i have readded a little bit of information and the reference that you provided i have left out the entire quote however for a few reasons first the article is already fairly long and so we have to be careful what we add in so as to not end up with a bloated article second we want to make sure that we are not placing 
 sorry about all this i understand your perspective thanks a lot 
 im also semiprotecting the 
 more 
 do you honestly think there is any point in that 
 yes and no no blocking your ips has been shown to be ineffective but i can and will semiprotect pages on which you engage in edit warring or personal attacks and posting a link to your ip edit history helps me find those please be civil you had a few days when you were really trying to be civil and i stood up for you now it looks like you are not even trying any more 
 i knew i would never be unblocked plus theres no point in being civil because you just know that you can never stop them bulgaristanis from spreading propaganda i have come to realize why no one in their right mind would use wikipedia as a primary sources its fun to contribute is all ps you dont have to worry about me getting into anymore edit wars jingiby will dig his own grave without anyone elses help regards 
 if i may suggest semiprotecting 
 you mean for eh look technically he should not edit war absolutely unfortunately in that particular edit i agree with him just following the link to 
 ok agreed 
 hi the 
 the consensus in that discussion was for the template to be deleted not redirected therefore the creation of the redirect was going against community consensus was there another community discussion somewhere else that negated the deletion discussion and decided to turn it into a redirect 
 there wasnt such a consensus no however i was trying to write a tool that would turn the template into i didnt hurry to do it before the template was deleted because i thought that specialwhatlinkshere would still allow me to find all pages transcluding even after it was deleted but apparently i was mistaken this was my bad for assuming poorly but if you would be willing to undelete the original template for just a couple of days to give me time to finish the translation work it would be very helpful 
 when you say all pages transcluding do you mean all pages that used this infobox and so were linked to it if so these were already taken care of you can see this at 
 i see you are quite right when i saw the transclusions disappear suddenly from whatlinkshere at about the same time the template was deleted i assumed that the renames had not been done and that mediawiki just wouldnt list transclusions for deleted templates it just didnt occur to me that someone might have gotten there before i did thanks for helping clear that up and im sorry to waste your time 
 definitely not a waste of time and im glad we got things cleared up 
 hi 
 hi debi unfortunately i am not in a position to reinstate the sloppy joes lunchroom and i wouldnt really be able to persuade anyone else to the version i saw was i imagine accurate but it was not 
 hi dana it seems to me that 
 at this point the best way the far can move forward is to get outside opinions and resolve the comments brought up by the outside commentors so far the image review is the biggest of these we have had other fars brought by users trying to push a point and these are usually closed after a couple of outside opinions after the far however it is up to the involved editors to say where the article goes from here it may be that an rfc on the article or rfc or us on various users might be in order im sure you would all prefer to keep this from going all the way through dispute resolution but that may be where it needs to go if the disruption continues debate is not a problem but changing the article against consensus even after being asked not to is disruptive
